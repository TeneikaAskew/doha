Accordingly, his request for a security clearance is denied.\nStatement of the Case\nApplicant requested a security clearance by submitting an Electronic Questionnaire\nfor Investigations Processing (e-QIP) on February 23, 2007. After reviewing the results of\nthe ensuing background investigation, adjudicators for the Defense Office of Hearings and\nFebruary 19, 2009\n\nRequired by Executive Order 10865, as amended, and by DoD Directive 5220.6 (Directive), as amended.\n \n1\nAdjudication of this case is controlled by the Revised Adjudicative Guidelines, approved by the President on\n2 \nDecember 29, 2005, which were implemented by the Department of Defense on September 1, 2006. The\nRevised Adjudicative Guidelines supersede the guidelines listed in Enclosure 2 to the Directive, and they apply\nto all adjudications or trustworthiness determinations in which an SOR was issued on or after September 1,\n2006.\n2\nAppeals (DOHA) were unable to make a preliminary affirmative finding  that it is clearly\n1\nconsistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s request. \nOn August 29, 2008, DOHA issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) that\nspecified as the basis for its decision security concerns addressed in the Directive under\nGuideline E (Personal Conduct) of the Revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG).  The SOR\n2\ncontained three allegations under Guideline E. In his Answer, signed and notarized on\nSeptember 16, 2008, Applicant admitted to allegation 1a and denied allegations 1b and 1c.\nHe also requested a hearing before an administrative judge. The government amended the\nSOR on October 20, 2008 by adding one allegation under Guideline E. In his response of\nNovember 10, 2008, Applicant denied the additional allegation.\nDepartment Counsel was prepared to proceed on November 13, 2008, and the case\nwas assigned to me on November 17, 2008. DOHA issued a Notice of Hearing on\nNovember 25, 2008 and I convened the hearing as scheduled on December 17, 2008.\nDuring the hearing, the government offered three exhibits, marked as Government\nExhibits (GE) 1 through 3, which were admitted without objection. Applicant testified and\noffered six exhibits, which were marked as Applicant Exhibits (AE) A through F and\nadmitted without objection. DOHA received the transcript on December 24, 2008.\nAdministrative Notice \nI take administrative notice of Title 8 of the U.S. Code, \u00a71324, which concerns the\nfelony of harboring illegal aliens. The pertinent federal statutory language follows:\n\u00a71324. Bringing in and harboring certain aliens\n(A) Any person who \u2013 \n(iii) knowing or in reckless disregard of the fact that an alien has\ncome to, entered, or remains in the United States in violation of\nlaw, conceals, harbors, or shields from detection, or attempts to\nconceal, harbor, or shield from detection, such alien in any\nplace, including any building or any means of transportation; \nshall be punished as provided in subparagraph (B). \n\nApplicant has not legally adopted his wife\u2019s children (Tr 97).\n3 \nOn his security clearance application, in response to the question that asks for his spouse\u2019s Social Security\n4 \nnumber, Applicant provided a number with the same format as a Social Security number. It does not have the\nformat of a tax ID number (also called an Employer Identification Number or EIN). The evidence is silent as\n3\n(B) A person who violates subparagraph (A) shall, for each alien in respect to\nwhom such a violation occurs\u2014 \n(ii) in the case of a violation of subparagraph (A)(ii), (iii), (iv), or (v)(II), be fined\nunder title 18, imprisoned not more than 5 years, or both.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant\u2019s admissions in response to the SOR are admitted as fact. After a thorough\nreview of the pleadings, Applicant\u2019s response to the Statement of Reasons, and the record\nevidence, I make the following additional findings of fact.\nApplicant, 63 years old, completed one year of college, specializing in accounting\n(AE C). He joined the federal government in 1966, and worked as a civilian for the\nDepartment of Defense for more than four decades. When he retired in 2004, he was\nemployed as an information management specialist. During his federal service, Applicant\nreceived more than 50 letters, awards and certificates for his superior job performance and\ncontributions (AE B; AE E). Applicant is currently employed as a senior manager for a\ndefense contractor.\nApplicant married in 1966. He has five adult children from the marriage, and seven\ngrandchildren. He and his first wife grew apart because of his long work hours and frequent\ntravel. They started living apart in 1989, and obtained a legal separation in 1993 (Tr 54; AE\nF). Their divorce became final in 2004. That year, he met his current wife, whom he married\nin December 2005 (GE 2). Applicant has two step-children, 13 and 15 years old, who are\nthe children of his current wife.  They also have an 8-month old son together.\n3\nApplicant\u2019s wife was born in a foreign country. She entered the United States illegally\nin the late 1990s with her first husband (GE 3; Tr 70). After their divorce, she worked at a\nhair salon doing general cleaning. When Applicant met her in 2004, and married her in\n2005, he did not know of her illegal status (Tr 49). He first learned of her status in April\n2006, when he was preparing their joint 2005 federal tax return and discovered she did not\nhave a Social Security number. She provided him with a number he referred to as a \u201ctax ID\nnumber,\u201d which appeared on her previous tax returns, W-2 forms, and bank statements. His\nwife told him that the IRS had notified her of a problem with the tax ID number on a previous\nreturn she had filed (Tr 71). Despite having this information, Applicant filed their 2005, and\nsubsequent tax returns, using the tax ID number.  He believed that her tax ID number was\n4\n\nto whether the number on the security clearance application is the \u201ctax ID number\u201d Applicant used on the\nfederal tax returns.\n4\nvalid to use on the return, although it could not be used to claim tax benefits (Tr 72). \nBetween mid-2006 and 2007, Applicant\u2019s mother-in-law came to the United States\nfor a heart operation. His father-in-law, who had been in the United States for several\nmonths, living with another family member, moved in with Applicant as well. Both family\nmembers were in the United States on visas (GE 3). Applicant\u2019s in-laws lived with him for\napproximately six months. They had little interaction, as neither spoke the other\u2019s language\n(Tr 92-97).\nIn June 2006, Applicant accepted a new job. Shortly after he started, he approached\nthe security manager and inquired whether or not he needed a security clearance. He was\ninstructed to complete a security clearance application, on which he disclosed his wife\u2019s\nforeign citizenship, but not her illegal status. He also failed to list his foreign in-laws (GE 1).\nApplicant believed that disclosing his wife\u2019s foreign citizenship was sufficient, and it did not\noccur to him that he also should disclose her illegal status (Tr 90-92).  \u201cThis -- this is how\nI was telling the Government.  Okay?  It wasn't on my mind after we got married or after I\ntold -- found out that -- to run to my security office, which I wasn't even sure who it was or\nwhat to say or \u2013\u201c (Tr 91). He also failed to inform his security officer of his wife\u2019s illegal\nstatus because \u201cI wasn\u2019t \u2013 you know, I wasn\u2019t \u2013 didn\u2019t know I had to for one thing, because\nI wasn\u2019t familiar with the industrial security regulation personnel thing.\u201d (Tr 88). During his\nsecurity clearance interview in November 2007, he did disclose his wife\u2019s illegal status to\nthe investigator (GE 3).\nAt the hearing, when asked if he was aware that contact with foreign nationals must\nbe reported to his security officer, he replied that he was aware, because of his experiences\nwith traveling while holding a clearance. However, he did not think such concerns were\nrelevant to his case: \u201cI just didn't know it would apply that once I found out my wife was\nillegal or a foreign national that I had to say that.  Okay?  I mean, she's my wife.\u201d He also\ndid not believe his marriage to a foreign national was a security concern: \u201cIt wasn't a\nconcern to me because I knew that I wasn't a risk. I could not be influenced or coerced or\nany of that stuff into doing anything wrong towards -- to jeopardize my clearance.\u201d (Tr 89).\nIn 2006, Applicant contacted the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) and\nobtained citizenship paperwork for his wife. He also researched web sites to obtain\ninformation about applying for citizenship (Tr 76). Subsequently, however, he \u201c...heard that\nthe government was using citizenship applications to find illegal immigrants and deport\nthem.\u201d (GE 3). Based on this understanding, and his belief that an illegal immigrant must\nbe outside the United States in order to file a citizenship application (Tr 73-74), he decided\nnot to submit the paperwork, and wait to see if immigration laws would be reformed (GE 3).\n\nDirective. 6.3.\n5 \n See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988).\n6\n See Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, 531.\n7\n5\nApplicant has not consulted an immigration attorney, although his current salary\nwould appear to allow him to do so(Tr 77). He seemed uncertain about the information his\nwife has obtained about her options. He believes she has talked with relatives and friends\nand may have received free legal advice through a service at her church (Tr 75). He does\nnot know if she has any rights based on her status as the spouse of an American citizen (Tr\n80). He thinks that in order to obtain legal status, his wife and her children must return to\nher native country and remain there for five years before she can seek U.S. citizenship.\nBecause Applicant wants his stepchildren \u201cto have a future\u201d in the United States, he\ndecided, within the past six months, that she should return to her native country (Tr 39-40;\n78-79). As of the date of the hearing, no further steps had been taken.\nPolicies\nEach security clearance decision must be a fair, impartial, and common sense\ndetermination based on examination of all available relevant and material information, and\nconsideration of the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in the Revised Adjudicative\nGuidelines (AG).  Decisions must also reflect consideration of the  \u201cwhole person\u201d factors\n5\nlisted in \u00b6 2(a) of the Guidelines.\nThe presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not\ndeterminative of a conclusion for or against an Applicant. However, specific applicable\nguidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against them as they\nrepresent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to classified information.\nIn this case, the pleadings and the information presented by the parties require\nconsideration of the security concerns and adjudicative factors addressed under Guideline\nE (Personal Conduct).  \nA security clearance decision is intended to determine  whether it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest  for an Applicant to be granted access to classified information.\n6\nThe government must produce admissible information on which it based the preliminary\ndecision to deny or revoke a security clearance. Additionally, the government must be able\nto prove controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If the government meets its burden, it then\nfalls to the Applicant to refute, extenuate or mitigate the government\u2019s case. Because no\none has a \u201cright\u201d to a security clearance, an Applicant bears a heavy burden of persuasion.7\nA person who has access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with\nthe government based on trust and confidence. Therefore, the government has a\ncompelling interest in ensuring each Applicant possesses the requisite judgment, reliability\n\n See Egan; Revised Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 2(b).\n8\n6\nand trustworthiness to protect the national interests as his or her own. The \u201cclearly\nconsistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any reasonable doubt\nabout an Applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the government.8\nAnalysis\nPersonal Conduct\nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern about personal conduct:\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor,\ndishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations\ncan raise questions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness\nand ability to protect classified information. Of special interest is\nany failure to provide truthful and candid answers during the\nsecurity clearance process or any other failure to cooperate with\nthe security clearance process.\nDisqualifying conditions AG \u00b6 16(a) and AG \u00b6 16(c) are relevant to the facts:\nAG \u00b6 16(a) - deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification\nof relevant facts from any personnel security questionnaire,\npersonal history statement, or similar form used to conduct\ninvestigations, determine employment qualifications, award\nbenefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or\ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities;\nAG \u00b6 16(c) - credible adverse information in several\nadjudicative issue areas that is not sufficient for an adverse\ndetermination under any other single guideline, but which,\nwhen considered as a whole, supports a whole-person\nassessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness,\nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules\nand regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the\nperson may not properly safeguard protected information.\nThe government alleges that, when he completed his security clearance\napplication, Applicant deliberately failed to disclose his in-laws, who are citizens and\nresidents of a foreign country. Falsification of a security clearance application implicates\nAG \u00b6 16(a); however, application of this disqualifying condition requires deliberate\nconcealment. Although Applicant failed to report his foreign in-laws on his security\nclearance application, he did report numerous other family members, including his former\n\n8 U.S.C. \u00a71324 (A) (iii).\n9 \n7\nwife, his five children, and his three siblings. More to the point, he disclosed several\nforeign relatives. If he intended to mislead the government about foreign contacts, it is\nunlikely that he would have disclosed the foreign nationality of his current wife and two\nstepchildren and provided their country of citizenship. Reporting his close foreign family\nmembers provided the government with notice that a security issue existed. I find\nApplicant\u2019s statement credible that omission of his in-laws was inadvertent. \nHowever, Applicant\u2019s conduct raises other security concerns. In 2006, he became\naware that his spouse and her children had been in the United States illegally for more\nthan 5 years, and that they remained in an illegal status. Nevertheless, he failed to take\nsteps to correct the situation. Most significantly, he engaged in felony conduct by violating\nthe federal immigration statute that prohibits harboring illegal aliens.  \n9\nApplicant also demonstrated untrustworthy behavior by failing to disclose on his\nsecurity clearance application that his spouse was an illegal alien. At the time he\ncompleted his security clearance application in February 2007, he had known of his wife\u2019s\nstatus for 10 months. He should have indicated this significant fact in his application. He\nalso should have informed his security officer. His statement that he \u201c...wasn\u2019t even sure\nwho it was\u201d (Tr 91) is not credible, since he previously had sought out his security\nmanager to find out whether or not he needed to submit a new security clearance\napplication (Tr 88). Applicant\u2019s harboring of an illegal immigrant, and his concealment of\nher status from the government, have continued since 2006. Based on his violation of\nfederal law, and his failure to comply with security requirements, AG \u00b6 16(c) applies. \nThe personal conduct guideline also includes factors that can mitigate disqualifying\nconditions. The following mitigating conditions are relevant to the facts: \nAG \u00b6 17(c) - the offense is so minor, or so much time has\npassed, or the behavior is so infrequent, or it happened under\nsuch unique circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does\nnot cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or\ngood judgment;\nAG \u00b6 17(d) - the individual has acknowledged the behavior\nand obtained counseling to change the behavior or taken\nother positive steps to alleviate the stressors, circumstances,\nor factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, or other\ninappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur.\nApplicant\u2019s conduct can hardly be considered minor. After he became aware that\n\n8\nhis spouse and her children were in the United States illegally, he failed to take steps to\ncorrect the situation, and violated federal law by harboring them. Applicant\u2019s conduct is\nnot in the past, but is ongoing and casts serious doubt on his trustworthiness and good\njudgment. AG \u00b617(c) does not apply.\nNor can AG 17(d) be applied. Although Applicant obtained information through INS\nand related web sites about applying for citizenship, he ultimately decided not to pursue\nthat option. Since then, he has taken no steps to consult or retain an immigration attorney\nto advise him on a plan of action, even though it appears that such a step would be\nfinancially within his means. He is unclear as to what information his wife has obtained.\nAs of the date of the hearing, Applicant had not resolved the situation: he was living with\nan illegal alien, had not sought professional advice, and had no plan other than an\nuninformed opinion that his wife and children might need to return to their native country.\nHis inaction raises doubts about whether or not he is committed to resolving this ongoing\nsecurity concern. I find against Applicant on Guideline E.\nWhole Person Analysis \nUnder the whole person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate the\nApplicant\u2019s security eligibility by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s conduct and all\nthe circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process\nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances\nsurrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency\nand recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the\nconduct; (5) extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence\nof rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the\nconduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the\nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nAG \u00b6 2(c) requires that the ultimate determination of whether to grant a security clearance\nmust be an overall common-sense judgment based upon careful consideration of the\nguidelines and the whole person concept. Under the cited guideline, I considered the\npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances\nsurrounding this case. \nIn April 2006, when Applicant learned that he was married to and living with an\nillegal alien, he was a mature and experienced adult with a long history of holding a\nsecurity clearance. Based on his familiarity with the security clearance process, he knew\nor should have known that those who hold security clearances are required to inform their\nsecurity departments of significant life changes that could affect their security worthiness.\n\n9\nHe often traveled while he held a security clearance, and admitted that this experience\nmade him aware of the concerns related to contacts with foreign nationals. Yet, when he\ncompleted the security clearance application, Applicant failed to inform the government of\na highly pertinent fact \u2013 that his wife was an illegal alien. Given his background and\nexperience, his claim that he was unaware of the need to inform his security manager of\nhis spouse\u2019s illegal status is not credible. His claim that he did not even know his security\nofficer\u2019s identity is undermined by the fact that he previously sought out his security officer\nto determine if he needed to complete a security clearance application. Finally, Applicant\ndid not report his wife\u2019s status because \u201cit wasn\u2019t a concern to me because I knew I wasn\u2019t\na risk.\u201d It is most troubling that Applicant decided, on his own, that the situation did not\nconstitute a security risk. The government requires those who hold security clearances to\ndisclose pertinent facts so that authorized security personnel can decide where security\nrisks lie. Applicant\u2019s ongoing violation of federal law, his failure to disclose his wife\u2019s illegal\nstatus for more than one-and-a-half years, and his willingness to disregard security\nrequirements, raise serious doubts about his trustworthiness and reliability.\nOverall, the record evidence fails to satisfy the doubts raised about Applicant\u2019s\nsuitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant has not\nmitigated the security concerns arising from the cited adjudicative guidelines.\nFormal Findings\nParagraph 1, Guideline E\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a - 1.c.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d.\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to allow Applicant access to\nclassified information. Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance is denied.\nRITA C. O\u2019BRIEN\nAdministrative Judge\n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact. Findings of Fact DOHA alleged under Guideline B, foreign influence, that Applicant\u2019s sister is a citizen and resident of the PRC (SOR \u00b6 1.a), and that Applicant traveled to the PRC to visit her in at least 2001, 2004, and 2005 (SOR \u00b6 1.b). In her answer of August 19, 2008, Applicant admitted the allegations, adding in explanation that her sister at age 25 exceeded the age limit when the rest of their family immigrated to the United States (U.S.). Applicant indicated that her sister is employed as an accountant for a private company in the PRC and is awaiting a visa to immigrate to the U.S. After considering the evidence of record, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant is a 28-year-old computer software engineer who has been employed by a U.S. defense contractor since April 2007 (Exs. 1, F). She seeks a secret clearance, never having held a security clearance in the past (Ex. 1). Applicant was born in a southern province of the PRC in January 1980 to native citizens (Ex. 1, Tr. 23-24). She was raised with an older sister, who was born in December 1973 (Ex. 1). Her mother was employed as an assembly worker in a balloon factory and her father worked for a construction company. Neither were ever members of the Chinese Communist Party (Tr. 25). In early February 1999, when Applicant was 19, she immigrated to the U.S. with her parents. They were sponsored by Applicant\u2019s paternal grandfather, who immigrated to the U.S. in 1989 (Tr. 26-27, 38). They joine",

Acting pro se, she\nanswered the SOR on August 19, 2008, and requested a hearing before an\nadministrative judge. On September 22, 2008, counsel for Applicant entered his\nappearance. The case was assigned to me on September 23, 2008, with a request for\n\nCountry Reports on Human Rights Practices-2007, China (includes Tibet, Hong Kong, and Macau),\n1\ndated March 11, 2008 (IV), Country Specific Information-China, dated December 10, 2007 (V), and\nBackground Note: China, dated April 2008. The Background Note was not included in the list of source\ndocuments but it was referenced in several footnotes in the government\u2019s Administrative Notice request and\na copy of the document was provided for review.\nIntelligence Threat Handbook, excerpts, dated June 2004 (I). The document was prepared for the\n2\nInteragency OPSEC Support Staff by the Centre for Counterintelligence and Security Studies, a private\ncontractor.\n2007 Report to Congress of the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission, extracts,\n3\ndated November 2007 (II).\nAnnual Report to Congress on Foreign Economic Collection and Industrial Espionage-2005, dated\n4\nAugust 2006 (III).\nPress Release\u2014Chinese Resident Pleads Guilty to Having Export Controlled Thermal-Imaging\n5\nCameras Sent to China, dated July 16, 2008 (VI), Press Release\u2014Chinese National Sentenced For\nCommitting Economic Espionage to Benefit China Navy Research Center, dated June 18, 2008 (VII), Press\nRelease\u2014Third Defendant Pleads Guilty in China Espionage Case, dated May 28, 2008 (VIII), Press\nRelease\u2014Chinese Agent Sentenced to Over 24 Years in Prison for Exporting United States Defense Articles\nto China, dated March 24, 2008 (IX), and  Press Release\u2014Former Chinese National Convicted of Economic\nEspionage to Benefit China Navy Research Center, dated August 2, 2007(X). None of the press releases\npertained specifically to Applicant.\n2\nadministrative notice pending from the government, infra. On October 14, 2008, I\nscheduled a hearing for November 20, 2008.\nAt the hearing held as scheduled, three government exhibits (Ex. 1-3) and seven\nApplicant exhibits (Ex. A-F) were admitted and Applicant and a maternal uncle testified,\nas reflected in a transcript (Tr.) received on November 28, 2008. Based upon a review\nof the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified\ninformation is granted.\nProcedural and Evidentiary Rulings\nRequest for Administrative Notice\nOn September 5, 2008, then assigned Department Counsel Gina Marine\nrequested administrative notice be taken of certain facts relating to the People\u2019s\nRepublic of China (PRC) and its foreign relations, including with the U.S. The request\nwas based on publications from the Department of State,  the Centre for\n1\nCounterintelligence and Security Studies,  the U.S. China Economic and Security\n2\nReview Commission,  and the Office of the National Counterintelligence Executive,  as\n3\n4\nwell as on press releases from the U.S. Department of Justice.  The government\u2019s\n5\nformal request and the attached documents were not admitted into evidence but were\nincluded in the record.\n\nApplicant testified she has about 60 relatives living in the U.S., about 90 percent of whom are U.S.\n6\ncitizens (Tr. 50). Her great-uncle testified that he has 37 relatives living in the U.S. (Tr. 98).\n3\nOn June 4, 2008, I notified the parties of my intention to take administrative\nnotice of specific facts, subject to revision based on the evidence admitted at the\nhearing and any valid objections. The parties were granted until October 22, 2008, to\nfile any objections to my taking notice of the facts set forth in the Order, and for\nApplicant to propose facts for administrative notice.\nThe government filed a timely request to extend the deadline to October 31,\n2008, which was granted without any objections. On October 31, 2008, the government\nrequested that administrative notice be taken of additional facts not explicitly included in\nthe October 2, 2008, Order. Applicant filed no response, but indicated at the hearing\nthat she did not object to administrative notice being taken of the facts set forth in the\nOrder as supplemented by the government on October 31, 2008. I agreed to take\nadministrative notice of particular facts pertaining to the PRC, as set forth in the\nFindings of Fact.\nFindings of Fact\nDOHA alleged under Guideline B, foreign influence, that Applicant\u2019s sister is a\ncitizen and resident of the PRC (SOR \u00b6 1.a), and that Applicant traveled to the PRC to\nvisit her in at least 2001, 2004, and 2005 (SOR \u00b6 1.b). In her answer of August 19,\n2008, Applicant admitted the allegations, adding in explanation that her sister at age 25\nexceeded the age limit when the rest of their family immigrated to the United States\n(U.S.). Applicant indicated that her sister is employed as an accountant for a private\ncompany in the PRC and is awaiting a visa to immigrate to the U.S. After considering\nthe evidence of record, I make the following findings of fact.\nApplicant is a 28-year-old computer software engineer who has been employed\nby a U.S. defense contractor since April 2007 (Exs. 1, F). She seeks a secret clearance,\nnever having held a security clearance in the past (Ex. 1).\nApplicant was born in a southern province of the PRC in January 1980 to native\ncitizens (Ex. 1, Tr. 23-24). She was raised with an older sister, who was born in\nDecember 1973 (Ex. 1). Her mother was employed as an assembly worker in a balloon\nfactory and her father worked for a construction company. Neither were ever members\nof the Chinese Communist Party (Tr. 25).\nIn early February 1999, when Applicant was 19, she immigrated to the U.S. with\nher parents. They were sponsored by Applicant\u2019s paternal grandfather, who immigrated\nto the U.S. in 1989 (Tr. 26-27, 38). They joined many paternal relatives in the U.S. who\nhad immigrated earlier (Ex. B, Tr. 42-49), including Applicant\u2019s great-aunt who has been\nin the U.S. more than 40 years (Tr. 45) and a great-uncle who arrived more than 30\nyears ago (Tr. 48).  Because her sister was 25 years old at the time, she was ineligible\n6\nto immigrate on her grandfather\u2019s petition so she remained behind in the PRC where\n\n4\nshe was employed as an accountant (Exs. 1, 2, Tr. 25-27). Applicant entered the U.S.\non a PRC passport valid from March 6, 1998, to March 5, 2003 (Exs. 3, A).\nApplicant and her parents lived with a great-uncle from 1999 to 2004 (Tr. 49, 99).\nThis uncle came to the U.S. under the sponsorship of his spouse\u2019s sister in March 1975\n(Tr. 96), and he worked as a senior programmer for a defense contractor for 25 years\n(Tr. 99-100). \nApplicant attended the local public high school from February 1999 to June 2001\n(Tr. 21). After graduating from high school, she started her college studies that Fall at\nthe state\u2019s university at a branch nearby. From late December 2001 to mid-January\n2002, Applicant traveled to the PRC to visit her sister (Exs. 1, 2, 3, A, Tr. 72-73). In\nJanuary 2003, she renewed her PRC passport for another five years (until March 5,\n2008) (Exs. 3, A).\nIn January 2004, Applicant transferred to the university\u2019s main campus to\ncontinue her undergraduate studies in computer science (Ex. 1, Tr. 21).  She had work-\nstudy obligations during the school year. Unemployed that summer, she took the\nopportunity to return to the PRC for a couple of weeks in August to visit her sister. As\nshe had in 2002, she traveled on her PRC passport (Exs. 1, 2, 3, A, Tr. 73).\nIn November 2004, Applicant and her mother became naturalized U.S. citizens\n(Ex. 1). Unbeknownst to Applicant at the time (Tr. 28), the acquisition of U.S. citizenship\nserved automatically to revoke their PRC citizenship (Ex. 2). Applicant\u2019s father remained\na legal permanent resident of the U.S. with PRC citizenship due to his limited facility\nwith the English language (Tr. 107). On January 18, 2005, Applicant obtained a U.S.\npassport which is valid to January 17, 2015 (Exs. 1, 3). In March 2005, Applicant\u2019s\nmother applied for Applicant\u2019s sister to emigrate from the PRC to the U.S. and her\npetition was approved in August 2005 (Ex. D, Tr. 27).\nFrom May to July 2005, Applicant was a summer intern in an undergraduate\nsummer program at another university. Unemployed on her return to the area, she\ntraveled to the PRC from August 4, 2005, to September 3, 2005, to spend time with her\nsister. Needing a visa for the trip, she sent both her PRC and U.S. passports to the\nChinese Embassy in June 2005. Her Chinese passport was invalidated (stamped\ncancelled and cut in the upper right hand corner) and then returned to her (Ex. A, Tr.\n28-35). She entered and exited the PRC on her U.S. passport (Exs. 1, 2, 3, Tr. 74).  On\nthis and previous trips to the PRC, she stayed with her sister (Tr. 92).\nIn January 2006, she began a co-op position as a quality assurance tester with a\ncomputer technology company. She finished her academic studies in December 2006,\nand was awarded her bachelor of science degree in February 2007 (Ex. 1). In about\nApril 2007, she left the job with the technology company for her present employment\nbecause it would allow her to write computer code (Tr. 21-22).\n\n5\nAt the request of her supervisor (Tr. 23), Applicant executed an e-QIP on May\n29, 2007. She disclosed her birth in the PRC, her U.S. naturalization in November 2004,\nand her possession of a valid U.S. passport issued in January 2005. She also disclosed\nthat she had held a PRC passport from about June 1998 to October 2004, which she\nindicated was invalid after she became a U.S. citizen. Applicant reported her sister\u2019s\nPRC residency and citizenship. She also listed her travels to the PRC from December\n2001 to January 2002, in August 2004, and from August 2005 to September 2005,\nindicating the purpose of each trip as \u201cother.\u201d (Ex. 1).\nOn January 25, 2008, Applicant was interviewed by a government investigator\nabout her foreign ties. She mistakenly indicated that her Chinese passport did not\nexpire until 2009, but she also denied any use of that passport after she acquired her\nU.S. passport in January 2005 and any intent to renew her foreign passport. Applicant\nexpressed her ultimate loyalty to the U.S., which she considered her home. According\nto the investigator\u2019s report, Applicant also expressed her intent to renounce her\ncitizenship with China if it meant she had to in order to remain a U.S. citizen, although\nshe was unsure of the procedure or whether it was in fact possible. Applicant disclosed\nthat her sister worked as an accountant for an Internet service provider in the PRC, and\nthat she visited her in the PRC in late 2001 into 2002, in 2004, and in 2005. Applicant\ndenied any untoward contact or activities. On February 12, 2008, Applicant was re-\ncontacted by the investigator to discuss her contacts with her sister, which she indicated\nwere by electronic mail once weekly. Applicant added that her sibling was unaware that\nshe had applied for a \u201cnational security position.\u201d (Ex. 2).\nIn March 2008, Applicant asked her employer to destroy her invalidated PRC\npassport. They refused to do so, so Applicant retained possession of the passport (Tr.\n34).\nDOHA requested Applicant verify the investigator\u2019s reports of her January 2008\ninterview and February 2008 contact. On May 19, 2008, Applicant indicated that the\nreports were inaccurate in that she had mistakenly indicated that her PRC passport was\nvalid through 2009 when it had expired in March 2008, and that she did not consider\nherself a dual citizen as when she applied for her U.S. citizenship, she \u201ceffectively\nrenounced\u201d her PRC citizenship. She added that she had not used her Chinese\ncitizenship after the trip in August 2004. During her stay in the PRC in September 2005,\nshe visited her sister and old classmates and friends. Apart from routine border contact,\nshe denied any interaction with Chinese government officials. Applicant reiterated that\nher loyalty lay with the U.S. government and that her contacts with her sister by\ntelephone and email generally concerned dating, shopping, new movies (Ex. 2). At the\nrequest of DOHA, Applicant furnished copies of her expired PRC and current U.S.\npassports (Ex. 3).\nApplicant\u2019s sister has worked for the privately-owned Chinese Internet company\nas an accountant since April 2004 (Ex. C, Tr. 52, 55, 108). Applicant speaks to her by\ntelephone once a month. Applicant has not told her that she has applied for a security\nclearance (Tr. 52-53). Their conversations revolve around their parents, whom her sister\n\n6\nhas not seen in almost three years, and everyday issues of mutual interest such as\nclothing and movies (Tr. 53). Her sister is awaiting a visa and intends to immigrate to\nthe U.S. (Tr. 60). Applicant\u2019s sister has a stable job and owns her home in the PRC.\nApplicant does not provide any financial support for her sister (Tr. 61). To Applicant\u2019s\nknowledge, her sister is not politically active in the PRC (Tr. 62).\nApplicant has four maternal uncles and some cousins who are resident citizens\nof the PRC (Ex. E, Tr. 66-68). Applicant visited with these relatives during her trips to\nthe PRC (Tr. 70), but she has otherwise had only one contact with them since\nimmigrating to the U.S. in February 1999. She spoke with an uncle on the occasion of\nher grandmother\u2019s funeral in 2007 (Tr. 69-70). To Applicant\u2019s knowledge, none of these\nrelatives have ever worked for the Chinese government (Tr. 71).\nApplicant has two female friends from elementary school who are resident\ncitizens of the PRC. One works as an accountant for a private trading (import/export)\ncompany. The other is an assembly worker in a commercial steel factory (Tr. 74).\nApplicant sends birthday greetings but has not spoken to these friends in more than a\nyear (Tr. 75).\nApplicant\u2019s father is employed as a plumber and her mother as an assembly\nworker in a piano factory in the U.S. (Tr. 24-25). They travel to China on occasion to\nvisit their daughter, most recently in about 2006 (Tr. 107).\nAs of November 2008, Applicant had no current plans to travel to the PRC (Tr.\n75). All of her financial assets (car, checking and savings and retirement accounts) are\nin the U.S. She lives with her parents in an apartment (Ex. 1, Tr. 20). Applicant owns no\nreal estate in the PRC or in the U.S. (Tr. 76).  Registered to vote in the U.S., Applicant\nhas performed jury service here twice (Tr. 77). She belongs to a couple of Asian-\nAmerican organizations, one at work and one in the local community. The organizations\u2019\nactivities are social as well as professional (networking, career programs) (Tr. 88-90). \n \nApplicant has proven to be an organized, hardworking, and competent employee\nfor the defense contractor (Exs. F, G). Her direct supervisor is confident of her ability to\nhandle situations \u201cwith thoughtfulness and maturity\u201d (Ex. F).  Applicant has abided by\nher employer\u2019s policies concerning the confidentiality of sensitive information (Tr. 85-\n86). Applicant recently started a master\u2019s degree program in systems engineering to\nimprove her skills (Ex. F, Tr. 88).\n \nFollowing review of official publications of the U.S. government that address the\neconomic, political, and intelligence activities of the PRC, I take administrative notice of\nthe following facts:\nThe PRC is a large and economically powerful country, with a population of just\nover 1.3 billion people. Its economy has recently grown at about 10% per year. China\nhas an authoritarian government dominated by the Chinese Communist Party. The\nNational People\u2019s Congress, the PRC\u2019s legislative body, is the highest organ of state\n\n7\npower. With China firmly committed to economic reform and greater openness, the\ninfluence of people and organizations outside the formal party structure has increased,\nbut in all important government, economic, and cultural institutions in China, the\nChinese Communist Party ensures that party and state policy guidance is followed.\nDuring 2007, the PRC government\u2019s human rights record remained poor, with a trend\ntoward increased harassment, detention, and imprisonment by government and security\nauthorities of those perceived as threatening to government authority. Foreign visitors in\nthe PRC may be placed under surveillance by security personnel, their hotel rooms,\ntelephones, and facsimile machines monitored, and their personal possessions,\nincluding computers, searched without their knowledge or consent. The security\nservices in China routinely monitored and entered residences and offices to gain access\nto computers, telephones, and fax machines. Foreign government officials, journalists,\nand business people with access to advanced proprietary technology are particularly\nlikely to be under surveillance. Americans not staying in hotels in China, including those\nstaying with friends or relatives, must register with local police as soon as they arrive.\nSince the Tiananmen Square crackdown in June 1989, the PRC has become a\nkey participant in the international community through its seat as a permanent member\nof the Security Council of the United Nations, and through diplomatic relations with other\ncountries. The U.S. and PRC have a history of cooperation on scientific and\nenvironmental issues. Recently, the two countries have cooperated with growing\neffectiveness on counterterrorism and on various aspects of law enforcement (computer\ncrime, intellectual property rights, human smuggling, corruption). China, a member of\nthe World Trade Organization since December 2001, is an important trading partner of\nthe U.S. Its trade surplus with the U.S. was $256.3 billion in 2007 while U.S. goods\nexports to China accounted for 5.7% of total U.S. goods exports.\nThe PRC possesses large military forces (strategic nuclear forces, army, navy\nand air force), which are in the process of transformation into a smaller, more mobile,\nhigh-tech military. In the last decade, the PRC\u2019s strategic posture has been one of\nselective modernization with an increasing focus on space-based assets. Civil-military\nintegration has led to increased utilization of commercial systems in military\napplications. The PRC places enormous pressure on foreign companies, including U.S.\nfirms, to transfer technology to Chinese companies as part of doing business in China.\nIn furtherance of these efforts, the PRC has aggressively targeted sensitive and\nprotected U.S. economic and militarily critical information subject to export control laws.\nThe PRC blends intelligence and non-intelligence assets, relying on covert espionage\nactivity by personnel from government ministries, commissions, institutes, and military\nindustries independent of the PRC intelligence services, and by targeting ethnic\nChinese who have access to sensitive information. Americans of Chinese ancestry are\nconsidered prime intelligence targets.\nA record number of countries (108) were involved in collection efforts against\nsensitive and protected U.S. technologies in fiscal year 2005 with a small number,\nincluding the PRC, among the most aggressive. As of 2007, as Chinese espionage\nagainst the U.S. military and American business continued to outpace the overwhelmed\n\nThere is no allegation that Applicant has engaged in any economic espionage or attempted to violate\n7\nexport controls for the benefit of the PRC. The criminal activity of others is relevant to the extent it reflects\nongoing efforts by the PRC to target U.S. sensitive technologies.\n8\nU.S. counterintelligence community, critical American secrets and proprietary\ntechnologies were being transferred to China. Ethnic Chinese with U.S. citizenship\nand/or legal residency have been convicted of procuring and exporting or attempting to\nexport sensitive U.S. technology to the PRC in violation of export controls. U.S.\nImmigration and Customs Enforcement officials have rated China\u2019s espionage and\nindustrial theft activities as the leading threat to the security of U.S. technology. The\nFederal Bureau of Investigation stepped up counterintelligence efforts against Chinese\nintelligence operations in the U.S. in July 2007 because of substantial concern about\nthose operations. In March 2008, an engineer who conspired with family members to\nexport sensitive naval technology to the PRC was sentenced to 293 months in federal\nprison. In May 2008, a U.S. naturalized citizen, who operated as an unregistered agent\nof the PRC government in the U.S., pleaded guilty to conspiracy to deliver national\ndefense information to the PRC. A PRC citizen with U.S. permanent residency was\nconvicted of aiding and abetting this unregistered agent between March 2007 and\nFebruary 2008. In June 2008, a software engineer was sentenced under the Economic\nEspionage Act (18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1831) for misappropriating a trade secret from his former\nemployer with the intent to benefit the PRC.7\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\n\n9\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship\ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government\nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk\nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified\ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation\nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis\nGuideline B, Foreign Influence\nThe security concern for foreign influence is set out in AG & 6:\nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual\nhas divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or\ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a\nway that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by\nany foreign interest. Adjudication under this Guideline can and should\nconsider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or\nfinancial interest is located, including, but not limited to, such\nconsiderations as whether the foreign country is known to target United\nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a\nrisk of terrorism.\nApplicant and her parents, natives of the PRC, immigrated to the U.S. in\nFebruary 1999. They joined many members of her father\u2019s family, who had immigrated\nbefore them. They left behind Applicant\u2019s sister, who at age 25 was ineligible for\nimmigration as a minor under their grandfather\u2019s sponsorship. AG \u00b6 7(a) (\u201ccontact with a\nforeign family member, business or professional associate, friend, or other person who\nis a citizen of or resident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of\nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion\u201d) applies.\nApplicant has ongoing contact, by email and/or telephone, once monthly with her sister,\n\nIn ISCR Case No. 06-17838 at 4 (App. Bd. Jan. 28, 2008), the Appeal Board discussed the\n8\nprecedential value of the decisions predating the revision of the Adjudicative Guidelines, and determined\nwhere the language of the Directive is unchanged or not substantively altered, the precedent remains valid.\nAG \u00b6 8(c) apparently adopted the Appeal Board\u2019s interpretation of foreign influence mitigating condition 1\n10\nwho is a resident citizen of the PRC, a country known to aggressively target U.S.\nsensitive technology. Applicant traveled to the PRC in 2001, 2004, and 2005 to visit her\nsister. AG \u00b6 7(b), \u201cconnections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that\ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to protect\nsensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person,\ngroup, or country by providing that information,\u201d is also implicated.\nApplicant is close to her parents, with whom she has resided since coming to the\nU.S., if not her entire life. The bonds that her parents share with their daughter in the\nPRC also must be taken into account in assessing the risk of undue foreign influence\n(see AG \u00b6 7(d), \u201csharing living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of\ncitizenship status, if that relationship creates a heightened risk of foreign inducement,\nmanipulation, pressure, or coercion\u201d). While the extent of her parents\u2019 ongoing contacts\nwith their older daughter is unclear, they have traveled to the PRC on occasion to visit\nher, most recently in about 2006. Within a year of her U.S. naturalization, Applicant\u2019s\nmother applied for her daughter to immigrate to the U.S. I conclude AG \u00b6 7(d) applies\nas well.\nApplicant does not have any current plans to travel to the PRC. No evidence was\npresented as to the extent of her parents\u2019 travel plans. Future travel to the PRC cannot\nbe ruled out by Applicant or her parents as long as Applicant\u2019s sibling is in the PRC.\nTheir vulnerability is heightened in the event of any such travel, as they would be within\nthe reach of Chinese entities, including the PRC government, that might seek to exert\ninfluence to gain access to classified information. At the same time, there is no evidence\nshowing that Applicant or her parents have engaged in any conduct or been targeted\nwhile in the PRC that would implicate AG \u00b6 7(i), \u201cconduct, especially while traveling\noutside the U.S., which may make the individual vulnerable to exploitation, pressure, or\ncoercion by a foreign group, government, or country.\u201d\nApplicant candidly disclosed at the hearing that she has several maternal uncles\nand cousins and two friends from elementary school who are PRC resident citizens.\nWhile she visited with at least some of them when she was in the PRC, her contact with\nthem since 1999 has otherwise been limited. She has spoken to one uncle on the\noccasion of her grandmother\u2019s death in 2007, and while she sends birthday greetings to\nher friends, she has not had contact with them for more than a year. Given the absence\nof any evidence of ongoing contact by Applicant or her parents with these foreign\nnationals,  these relationships do not present a heightened risk (see AG \u00b6 8(c), \u201ccontact\nor communication with foreign citizens is so casual and infrequent that there is little\nlikelihood that it could create a risk for foreign influence or exploitation\u201d). However, AG \u00b6\n8(c) does not apply because of Applicant\u2019s and her parents\u2019 contacts with her sister in\nthe PRC, which cannot reasonably be termed \u201cso casual or infrequent.\u201d8\n\n(FIMC 1) under the previous guidelines. The Appeal Board had determined that contacts with relatives living\nin a foreign country must be both casual and infrequent to apply FIMC 1. See ISCR Case No. 04-12500 at 4\n(App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006). Moreover, contacts with such family members are presumed to be \u201cnot casual.\u201d Id.\nThe Appeal Board has articulated a \u201cheightened risk\u201d or \u201cvery heavy burden\u201d in People\u2019s Republic\n9\nof China (PRC) cases because of that country\u2019s hostility to the U.S. and aggressive intelligence collection\nefforts. See ISCR Case No. 06-24575 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 7, 2007) (articulating \u201cvery heavy burden\u201d standard\nand reversing grant of clearance in case involving family members living in the PRC); ISCR Case No. 07-\n02485 at 4-5 (App. Bd. May 9, 2008); ISCR Case No. 07-02485 at 4-5 (App. Bd. May 9, 2008).\n11\nApplicant\u2019s unrebutted testimony is that her sister is nonpolitical and has no\nconnection with the PRC government. It must also be noted that the U.S. has approved\nher sister for immigration to the U.S. However, mitigating condition AG \u00b6 8(a) (\u201cthe\nnature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which these persons are\nlocated, or the positions or activities of those persons in that country are such that it is\nunlikely the individual will be placed in a position of having to choose between the\ninterests of a foreign individual, group, organization, or government and the interests of\nthe U.S.\u201d) does not apply because of her and her parents\u2019 close bonds with her sister in\nthe PRC, and the PRC\u2019s aggressive pursuit of U.S. sensitive and classified information.9\nHer sister\u2019s employment as an accountant for a private Internet provider does not fully\nmitigate the risk of her being exploited by the PRC government or by those in industry\nthat might target U.S. classified data for competitive advantage. As reported by the U.S.\nState Department, the PRC government tightened restrictions on freedom of speech\nand the press in 2007, in part by increasing its efforts to control and censor the Internet.\nThe risk of foreign influence may yet be mitigated by deep and longstanding\nrelationships and loyalties in the U.S. (see AG \u00b6 8(b), \u201cthere is no conflict of interest,\neither because the individual's sense of loyalty or obligation to the foreign person,\ngroup, government, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and\nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected\nto resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest\u201d). Applicant is a relatively\nrecent emigree, having lived in the U.S. for less than 10 years. Yet, Applicant and\nparents chose to immigrate to the U.S., knowing that they would have to leave her sister\nbehind. Applicant left the PRC when she was 19, before she had an opportunity to\nestablish herself professionally or financially in the PRC. Since coming to the U.S. in\n1999, she has developed significant ties to the U.S. that establish the expectation that\nshe will act in the U.S. interest. She attended public high school when she would have\nbeen a few years older than her fellow students.  After graduating in 2001, she went on\nto college, where she had work-study obligations in addition to academics. She held a\nco-op position as a quality assurance tester with a technology company while finishing\nher undergraduate studies. Shortly after she earned her B.S. degree, she began\nworking for her current employer. She has performed her duties competently and in a\ntrustworthy manner. All of her financial assets (savings, salary, and retirement) are in\nthe U.S. Shortly after she became eligible, she applied for U.S. citizenship, and she took\nthe oath of naturalization by choice in November 2004. In January 2005, she obtained\nher U.S. passport, and traveled on that passport to the PRC in late August 2005.\nApplicant\u2019s only significant tie to the PRC at this point is her sister, who intends to\n\n12\nimmigrate to the U.S. once a visa becomes available.  All of the other family members\nto whom she is close, including her parents and the great-uncle who provided them a\nhome until 2004, are in the U.S. AG \u00b6 8(b) fully applies to mitigate the foreign influence\nsecurity concerns.\nWhole-Person Concept\nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.\nThe salient issue in the security clearance determination is not in terms of loyalty,\nbut rather what is clearly consistent with the national interest. See Executive Order\n10865, Section 7. I have considered all the factors as previously discussed under the\nforeign influence guideline, supra, as part of the whole-person analysis. An applicant\nmay have the best of intentions and yet be in an untenable position of potentially having\nto choose between a dear family member and the interests of the U.S. A Guideline B\ndecision involving the PRC must take into consideration the geopolitical situation. With\nChina firmly committed to economic reform and greater openness, the influence of\npeople and organizations outside the formal party structure has increased, but in all\nimportant government, economic, and cultural institutions in China, the Chinese\nCommunist Party ensures that party and state policy guidance is followed. During 2007,\nthe PRC government\u2019s human rights record remained poor, and the PRC is a known\ncollector of U.S. intelligence and economic information. While Applicant\u2019s sister has\nbeen approved for U.S. immigration since August 2005, it is unclear at this point when\nshe will be given the required visa. But what is known about Applicant, her parents, and\nher father\u2019s family, is that they have chosen to make their life in the U.S. There is no\nevidence showing that they have any connection to, or affinity for, the PRC government.\nApplicant has sufficient relationships with U.S. residents and loyalties to the U.S. to\nmake me confident that she would resolve any conflict that should arise in favor of the\nU.S. interest (see AG \u00b6 8(b)). After considering all the available information, I am\n\n13\npersuaded that Applicant can be counted on to fulfill the fiduciary obligations of a\nsecurity clearance.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline B:\nFOR  APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor  Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor  Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is clearly consistent with the national interest\nto grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified\ninformation is granted.\nELIZABETH M. MATCHINSKI\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Eligibility for access to sensitive information is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted her Public Trust Position Application (SF-85P), on April 11, \n2007. On October 17, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) \nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the trustworthiness concerns under \nGuideline F (Financial Considerations) for Applicant.  \n \nThe action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1990), as amended; Department of Defense \nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); Department of Defense (DoD) Regulation \n5200.2-R, Personnel Security Program, dated January 1987, as amended (Regulation), \nand the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on \nDecember 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued \nafter September 1, 2006.  \n1 \n \nMay 27, 2009\n\n2 \n \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on October 22, 2008. She answered \nthe SOR in writing on December 5, 2008, and requested a hearing before an \nAdministrative Judge. DOHA received the request on December 8, 2008. Department \nCounsel was prepared to proceed on December 29, 2008, and I received the case \nassignment on February 11, 2009.  \n \nDOHA issued a notice of hearing on March 4, 2009, scheduling the case for April \n7, 2009. The hearing was held as scheduled. The Government offered Government \nExhibits (GE) 1 through 6, which were received without objection. Applicant testified on \nher own behalf, and offered Applicant Exhibits (AE) A and B, which were received \nwithout objection.  \n \nI held the record open until April 21, 2009 to afford the Applicant an opportunity \nto submit additional material. On April 21, 2009, Applicant submitted an e-mail request \nseeking an extension of her submission deadline. Without objection from the \nGovernment, I granted her request for an extension until April 28, 2009. Applicant timely \nsubmitted AE C through G without objection. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) \non April 15, 2009.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn her Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the factual allegations. After a \ncomplete and thorough review of the evidence, I make the following additional findings \nof fact: \n \n \nApplicant is a 58-year-old team lead in the enrollment production department of \nher defense contractor employer. She has worked for this employer since July 2007. GE \n1, Tr. 15. She seeks access to sensitive information in conjunction with a public trust \nposition, which is a condition of her employment.

She also was awarded an insurance certification from a vocational school in April \n2007, which allowed her to sell insurance in her state. Tr. 14-15. Applicant was \npreviously married from November 1968 to February 1981. That marriage ended by \ndivorce. She has four adult children born during that marriage. Applicant is not married, \nbut is involved in a 22-year relationship. Tr. 11-12. \n \nApplicant\u2019s background investigation addressed her financial situation and \nincluded the review of her April 2007 SF-85P, two July 2008 Answers to DOHA \nInterrogatories, and April 2007, February 2008 and September 2008 credit reports. GE \n1 \u2013 6. \n \nThe Government alleged in the SOR and established by Applicant\u2019s admissions \nand/or evidence presented that Applicant has/had nine delinquent debts totaling \n$8,160.00. The debts consist of two judgments, two past due accounts and five \ncollection accounts. Applicant\u2019s indebtedness began after she was laid off from her job \nin November 2000 and have been ongoing. Response to SOR, GE 3, Tr. 17-36. \n\n3 \n \n \nApplicant has provided no documentation demonstrating that she has paid and/or \nresolved any of the nine debts listed in SOR. Following her lay-off in November 2000, \nshe remained unemployed until August 2001. Tr. 21, 36. Her SF-85P reflects \nsubsequent periods of unemployment from September 2003 to November 2003, \nJanuary 2004 to March 2004, October 2004 to January 2005, July 2005 to March 2006, \nand August 2006 to April 2007. GE 1, AE C.  \n \nWhen she was interviewed in July 2007 by an Office of Personnel Management \n(OPM) investigator regarding her indebtedness, she indicated she planned to sell her \nhouse \u201cin about a year\u201d and use the profits to pay off her debts. GE 3. By fall 2008, she \nrealized the \u201cbottom fell out of the [real estate] market\u201d and she was unable to sell her \nhouse and gain the expected profits to pay off her debts. Tr. 25-26, 40. Applicant stated \nthat \u201cstupidity\u201d and never learning how to manage her money and helping her children \ncontributed to her current financial situation. Tr. 37. \n \nApplicant stated that many of her family members have served in the military to \ninclude her father, brothers, cousins, brothers-in-law, nephews, nieces and a son. She \nprofessed her loyalty as an American and stated she would never do anything to \ncompromise national security. Response to SOR, GE 3. \n \nApplicant submitted performance evaluations covering the time frame April 2007 \nto March 2009 from her current employer reflecting above average performance, a \nCertificate of Appreciation for \u201cOutstanding Department Support\u201d received in August \n2008, and an \u201cAll Star Award\u201d received in October 2008. AE A, AE B, AE E, AE F. \nApplicant\u2019s post-hearing budget reflects a net monthly remainder of $120.00. AE G. \n \nPolicies \n \nPositions designated as ADP I and ADP II are classified as \u201csensitive positions.\u201d  \n(See Regulation \u00b6\u00b6 C3.1.2.1.1.7 and C3.1.2.1.2.3.)  \u201cThe standard that must be met for \n. . . assignment to sensitive duties is that, based on all available information, the \nperson\u2019s loyalty, reliability, and trustworthiness are such that . . . assigning the person to \nsensitive duties is clearly consistent with the interests of national security.\u201d (See \nRegulation \u00b6 C6.1.1.1.) The Deputy Under Secretary of Defense (Counterintelligence \nand Security) Memorandum, dated November 19, 2004, indicates trustworthiness \nadjudications will apply to cases forwarded to DOHA by the Defense Security Service \nand Office of Personnel Management.  Department of Defense contractor personnel are \nafforded the right to the procedures contained in the Directive before any final \nunfavorable access determination may be made. (See Regulation \u00b6 C8.2.1.)   \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a public trust position, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the \nAG. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n\n4 \n \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \n[sensitive] information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable \ntrustworthiness decision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to sensitive information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard sensitive information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nsensitive information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order (EO) 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin \nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty \nof the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe trustworthiness concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations \nis set out in AG & 18:   \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \n[sensitive] \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \n\n5 \n \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise trustworthiness concerns.  \nUnder AG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially \ndisqualifying. Similarly under AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ \nmay raise security concerns. Applicant accumulated nine delinquent accounts, totaling \n$8,160.00 as noted supra. Her indebtedness began in 2000 and has been ongoing. The \nevidence is sufficient to raise these potentially disqualifying conditions, requiring a \ncloser examination. \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate \ntrustworthiness concerns arising from financial difficulties. Applicant experienced \nseveral periods of unemployment and was unable to sell her house as a result of a \ndistressed real estate market. Two potential mitigating conditions apply under this \nconcern. \n \nUnder AG & 20(b), it may be mitigating where Athe conditions that resulted in the \nfinancial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a \nbusiness downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), \nand the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.@ As noted, Applicant \nexperienced several periods of unemployment, the first occurring in 2000 and the most \nrecent ending in 2007. She has been continuously employed since July 2007. In 2007, \nshe expressed her intent to an OPM investigator to sell her house in the 2008 timeframe \nand use the profits to pay off her debts. However, as the real estate market \ndeteriorated, she decided against putting her house on the market. \n \nI note Applicant\u2019s financial problems are not recent, and she has been employed \nsince July 2007. Since becoming employed, Applicant has made no progress in \nresolving any of the alleged debts. She also indicated she never learned how to \nmanage money and provided financial assistance to her children even if doing so was to \nher detriment. To invoke full application of AG \u00b6 20(b), the Applicant must have acted \nresponsibly. Applicant failed to show that these factors precluded her from addressing \nany of her debts in whole or in part, especially since becoming employed and being \naware her financial situation was a security concern since at least from the time of her \nOPM interview in July 2007.  \n \nAG & 20(d) applies where the evidence shows Athe individual initiated a good-\nfaith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.@ Applicant produced \nno such evidence. Her post hearing submissions indicated that her attempts to resolve \nher indebtedness were either unsuccessful or she was unable to provide documentation \nof payment plans with creditors. I conclude none of these potentially mitigating \nconditions apply. \n \nThe \nobjective \nof \na \ntrustworthiness \ndetermination \nis \nthe \nfair-minded, \ncommonsense assessment of a person\u2019s trustworthiness and fitness for access to \nsensitive information. Indeed, the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept recognizes we should view a \n\n6 \n \n                                                          \nperson by the totality of his acts and omissions. Each case must be adjudged on its own \nmerits, taking into consideration all relevant circumstances, and applying sound \njudgment, mature thinking, and careful analysis. \n \nConsidering all relevant and material facts and circumstances present in this \ncase, the whole person concept, the facts listed in \u00b6 6.3.1 through \u00b6 6.3.6 of the \nDirective, and the applicable disqualifying and mitigating conditions, I find Applicant has \nnot mitigated the financial considerations security concern. She has not overcome the \ncase against her and satisfied her ultimate burden of persuasion.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a public trust position. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has not mitigated the trustworthiness concerns arising from her \nfinancial considerations.  \n \nIn fairness to the Applicant, this decision should not be construed as a \ndetermination that she cannot or will not attain the state of financial stability necessary \nto justify the holding of a public trust position. To the contrary, her mitigating evidence \nand whole person analysis suggests a sound potential for positive reform and \noutstanding accomplishments in the defense industry. Should Applicant be afforded an \nopportunity to reapply for a public trust position in the future, she may well demonstrate \npersuasive evidence warranting a favorable result. \n \n  \nI take this position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518 (1988), my \u201ccareful consideration of the whole person factors\u201d1 and \nsupporting evidence, my application of the pertinent factors under the adjudicative \nprocess, and my interpretation of my responsibilities under the Guidelines. Applicant \nhas not mitigated or overcome the Government\u2019s case. For the reasons stated, I \nconclude she is not eligible for access to a public trust position. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a. \u2013 1.j.:  \nAgainst Applicant2 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n1 See ISCR Case No. 04-06242 at 2 (App. Bd.

The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under Guidelines F\nand E on November 7, 2008. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865,\nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended;\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised\nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and\neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR. He answered the SOR in writing on\nNovember 29, 2008, and requested a hearing before an administrative judge. DOHA\nSeptember 14, 2009\n\nW hen  SOR allegations are controverted, the government bears the burden of producing evidence sufficient\n1\nto prove controverted allegations. Directive, \u00b6 E3.1.14. That burden has two components. First, the\ngovernment must establish by substantial evidence that the facts and events alleged in the SOR indeed took\nplace. Second, the government must establish a nexus between the existence of the established facts and\nevents and a legitimate security concern. See ISCR Case No. 07-18525 (App. Bd. Feb. 18, 2009), (concurring\nand dissenting, in part).\nGE 1; AE F; AE G; AE H; AE I; Tr. 15-20, 67-70. \n2\n2\n \n \nreceived the request on December 1, 2008. Department Counsel was prepared to\nproceed on March 20, 2009. DOHA assigned the case to another administrative judge\non April 16, 2009, who scheduled a hearing on May 22, 2009. Due to an unexpected\nemergency, the administrative judge could not proceed with the hearing as scheduled.\nDOHA reassigned the case to me on May 26, 2008. DOHA issued a notice of hearing\non June 22, 2009, and I convened the hearing as scheduled on July 10, 2009. The\ngovernment offered six exhibits (GE) 1 through 6, which were received and admitted\ninto evidence without objection. Applicant and one witnesses testified on his behalf. He\nsubmitted five exhibits (AE) A through E, which were received and admitted into\nevidence without objection. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on July 16,\n2009. I held the record open until July 31, 2009 for the admission of additional evidence.\nIn an Order dated July 27, 2009, I granted Applicant\u2019s request for additional time to\nsubmit this information. Applicant timely submitted the additional information, which has\nbeen admitted as AE F through AE N, without objection. The record closed on August\n10, 2009.\nProcedural and Evidentiary Rulings\nNotice\nAt the hearing, Applicant indicated he received the hearing notice less than 15\ndays before the hearing. (Tr. 9.) I advised Applicant of his right under \u00b6 E3.1.8 of the\nDirective to 15 days notice before the hearing. Applicant affirmatively waived his right to\n15 days notice. (Tr. 9-10.) \nFindings of Fact\nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the factual allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a,\n1.c, 1.e-1.h, and 1.j-1.l of the SOR, with explanation. He denied the factual allegations\nin \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.d, 1.i, 1.m, and 1.n of the SOR.  He also provided additional information to\n1\nsupport his request for eligibility for a security clearance.  \nApplicant, who is 39 years old, works as a security guard for a Department of\nDefense contractor, a position he began in June 2007. Applicant has worked as a\nsecurity guard or corrections officer since 2001. His supervisors describe him as hard\nworking, with a willingness to help others. He works as a volunteer fireman in his\ncommunity and has done so for the last 18 years.  \n2\n\nAE A; Tr. 50-51.\n3\nAE A; Tr. 17-19.\n4\nAE A; Tr. 52, 69-71.\n5\nGE 2; AE L; Tr. 42-43.\n6\nTr. 44-48, 60.\n7\n3\n \n \nIn 2004, Applicant had significant credit card debt from the past. His father\nobtained a $25,000 equity loan on his home to pay Applicant\u2019s debt. Applicant started\npayments on the equity loan immediately and has paid the monthly payment for the last\nfive years. Five years of payments remain.3\nApplicant started working as a corrections officer in 2002. His girlfriend\ndeveloped problems during her pregnancy with his son in 2004. He missed time from\nwork to care for her. As a result, the corrections department fired him in December\n2004. Without an income, Applicant used his credit cards to pay his living expenses and\nto purchase items for his son such as diapers, formula, a crib, and clothes.4\nApplicant obtained another position as a security guard, where he worked for two\nmonths. He then moved out of state with his girlfriend and son. Shortly after the move,\nhis daughter was born. He obtained a job in security in the other state, where he worked\nfor two years, earning sufficient income to pay his usual living expenses. While living out\nof state, he required hospital treatment for gout, a medical condition from which he\nsuffers. He received assistance from community resources to help pay his medical\nexpenses. He returned to his home state alone in 2007.5\nApplicant currently earns $820 bi-weekly in gross income, for an annual income\nof $21,320. His bi-weekly net income is approximately $670 for a total net monthly\nincome of $1,340. He works overtime when asked. His earnings statement for May and\nJune 2009 reflect that he worked between 11. 5 and 19 hours of overtime each pay\nperiod, except one pay period. This resulted in an additional net income of $301 in May\nand $136 in June. Because he is paid bi-weekly, he received an additional pay check in\nMay 2009.6\nIn addition to the $281 monthly equity loan payment, Applicant\u2019s monthly\nexpenses include $100 in rent to his father, with whom he lives, $40 in car insurance,\n$80 for gasoline, $50 for utilities, $25 for clothes, and $160 in voluntary child support for\ntotal ordinary monthly expenses of $736. He also pays $200 a month on one debt and\n$200 on a truck repair bill. He did not mention food expenses or other costs such as a\nhair cut. The transmission in his 2001 truck needs to be repaired and he estimates the\nrepair cost at approximately $1,500. He does not use credit cards now.7\nIn early 2008, the sheriff served him with court papers for the $7,161 debt listed\nin allegation 1.l. Applicant contacted counsel for the creditor and developed a\n\nAE B; Tr. 37-39.\n8\nResponse to SOR; GE 4; GE 5; GE 6; AE K; AE M; Tr. 28, 34, 39-41. \n9\nTr. 28-41. \n10\nAt the hearing, Department Counsel raised questions about whether Applicant accurately completed his\n11\nsecurity clearance application. The type SF-86, which is part of the record, reflected an incorrect employment\nhistory, which Applicant pointed out. Applicant insisted that he hand wrote his answers on the SF-86 and that\nhe did not type his application. As requested at the hearing, Applicant provided a copy of his hand written\nanswers. AE N. No issue is raised from this colloquy.  Tr. 20-26, 77. \n4\n \n \nrepayment plan. On March 7, 2008, he signed a Stipulation In Lieu of Judgment, which\nset out the terms of his repayment agreement. He made the initial $740 payment and\neach monthly payment since April 2008. His remaining balance owed on June 22, 2009\nwas $3,951. If he fails to make the required payments, the creditor can request the court\nto enter judgment against Applicant for any unpaid balance.   \n8\nWhen the government mailed interrogatories to Applicant, it listed two additional\ncredit card debts. Applicant verified that he resolved both debts in 2008. Applicant\ndenies any knowledge of the debts listed in allegations 1.b, and 1.i. Applicant\u2019s credible\ndenial of knowledge of these two debts is sufficient to refute the allegations of these two\ndelinquent debts. The pertinent credit report did not have sufficient information for\nApplicant to locate the account.  \nApplicant also denied owing the debt listed in allegation 1.m. Upon further\ndiscussion at the hearing, Applicant believed 1.m. was an automobile repair store\naccount, which he had paid. He verified that this debt is paid in full.9\nApplicant does not deny owing the remaining debts, although he does dispute\nthe current balances on several accounts. He has not paid the remaining debts, as he\nlacks funds to pay these debts in full.  \n10\nIn the interrogatories sent to Applicant in July 2008, the government identified 16\nunpaid debts, totaling $38,763. Applicant fully resolved two debts and has complied with\nthe payment plan for a third debt. He also proved that one listed debt is paid and two\nother debts are not his. Applicant has resolved five debts totaling $4,895 and through\nthe payment plan, has paid approximately 50% of the $7,161 debt. He still owes 10\nunpaid debts valued at $26,707. \nWhen Applicant completed his security clearance application on June 24, 2007,\nhe hand wrote his answers.  He answered \u201cno\u201d to the following questions:\n11\nSection 28: Your Financial Delinquencies\na.   In the last 7 years, have you been over 180 days delinquent on any debt(s)?\n\nGE 1; Tr. 54-58.\n12\nAE G through AE J.\n13\n5\n \n \nb.   Are you currently over 90 days delinquent on any debt(s)?\nApplicant acknowledges that he knew he had unpaid debts. He answered \u201cno\u201d\nbecause he didn\u2019t think people needed to know his financial situation and because his\nfinances were his personal business. He did not understand the need for the federal\ngovernment to know about his finances because when other organizations of the State\nconducted background checks on him, the focus was criminal conduct, not his finances.\nHe is embarrassed about his debts. At the hearing Applicant answered no to a question\nasking if he had a concern that his debts would hurt his chances of getting a security\nclearance.12\nSupervisors, friends and his brother wrote letters of recommendation on his\nbehalf. They praise his volunteer service as a fireman to the community. His brother\nadvises that Applicant, who lives with his father, is available to assist with any health\nissues his elderly father may have. He also provides transportation and home repair for\nhis father and other elderly relatives. All acknowledge he has financial difficulties, which\nthey believe he will resolve.  \n13\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based\non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\n\n6\n \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d An\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision.\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship\ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government\nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk\nan applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified\ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation\nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set\nout in AG & 18:      \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nAG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.\nSimilarly under AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise\nsecurity concerns. Applicant accumulated significant delinquent debt and has been\nunable to pay many of the obligations for a period of time. The evidence is sufficient to\nraise these potentially disqualifying conditions, requiring a closer examination.\nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security\nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG \u00b6 20(a), the disqualifying condition\nmay be mitigated where Athe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or\noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt\n\nAG \u00b6\u00b6 20(e) and 20(f) are not applicable in this case.\n14\n7\n \n \non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ Applicant=s\nfinancial worries arose over a period of time through the accumulation of credit card\ndebt. The record contains insufficient evidence to show that his debt accumulation\noccurred under unusual circumstances which will not occur again. This mitigating\ncondition does not apply\nUnder AG & 20(b), it may be mitigating where Athe conditions that resulted in the\nfinancial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a\nbusiness downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation),\nand the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.@ Applicant\u2019s financial\nissues relate to his employment, including periods of unemployment and lower wages.\nSince 2007, he has worked consistently and full-time. He earns just over $10 an hour,\nwhich does not provide significant excess income to pay usual living expenses and\ndelinquent debt. He is current in the debts he can pay. This mitigating condition partially\napplies. \nEvidence that Athe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control@\nis potentially mitigating under AG & 20(c). Applicant has not received financial\ncounseling. Given his current level of income and his budget, financial counseling alone\nwould not be sufficient to mitigate security concerns. His current expenses are under\ncontrol. He is slowly working towards resolution of his outstanding debt problems. Thus,\nthe mitigating condition has some applicability.\nSimilarly, AG & 20(d) applies where the evidence shows Athe individual initiated a\ngood-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.@ Applicant paid\ntwo debts and is currently paying on another debt. While he did not take the initiative to\nresolve this debt, he has complied with the repayment plan he developed. For five\nyears, he has paid the equity loan on his father\u2019s house, which resolved past debt. This\nmitigating condition partially applies.14\nGuideline E, Personal Conduct\nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern pertaining to personal conduct:\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful\nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other\nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\nAG \u00b6 16(a) describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be\ndisqualifying:\n\nSee ISCR Case No. 03-09483 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov.17, 2004)(explaining holding in ISCR Case No. 02-23133\n15\nat 5 (App. Bd. Jun. 9, 2004)).\n8\n \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from\nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or\nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment\nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance\neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities.\nFor AG \u00b6 16(a) to apply, Applicant\u2019s omission, concealment or falsification in his\nanswer must be deliberate. The government established that Applicant omitted a\nmaterial fact from his SF-86 when he answered \u201cno\u201d to Questions 28a, about debts over\n180 days delinquent, and 28b, about debts currently 90 days overdue. This information\nis material to the evaluation of Applicant\u2019s trustworthiness to hold a security clearance\nand to his honesty. When a falsification allegation is controverted, the government has\nthe burden of proving it. Proof of an omission, standing alone, does not establish or\nprove an applicant\u2019s intent or state of mind when the omission occurred. An\nadministrative judge must consider the record evidence as a whole to determine\nwhether there is direct or circumstantial evidence concerning an applicant\u2019s intent or\nstate of mind at the time the omission occurred.15\nWhen he completed his SF-86 in June 2007, Applicant denied any delinquent\ndebts when he knew he had many overdue debts. He did not think people needed to\nknow about his finances. His statement is an admission that he intentionally falsified this\nanswer. The government has established its case under AG \u00b6 16(a)\nUnder AG \u00b6 17, an applicant may mitigate the government\u2019s security concerns in\nthe following manner in this case:\n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission,\nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts;\n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was\ncaused or significantly contributed to by improper or inadequate advice of\nauthorized personnel or legal counsel advising or instructing the individual\nspecifically concerning the security clearance process. Upon being made\naware of the requirement to cooperate or provide the information, the\nindividual cooperated fully and truthfully;\n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is\nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is\nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability,\ntrustworthiness, or good judgment;\n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling\nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the\n\n9\n \n \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable,\nor other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur;\n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate\nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress; and\n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable\nreliability.\nAfter reviewing the facts of this case and the above mitigating conditions, I\nconclude that Applicant has not mitigated the falsification of his answer to questions 28a\nand 28b in his security clearance application. Guideline E is found against Applicant.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of an applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the\nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole person concept. The decision to grant or deny a security\nclearance requires a careful weighing of all relevant factors, both favorable and\nunfavorable. In so doing, an administrative judge must review all the evidence of record,\nnot a single item in isolation, to determine if a security concern is established and then\nwhether it is mitigated. A determination of an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security\nclearance should not be made as punishment for specific past conduct, but on a\nreasonable and careful evaluation of all the evidence of record to decide if a nexus\nexists between established facts and a legitimate security concern. \nIn reaching a conclusion, I considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating\nconditions in light of all the facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant\nworks a full-time job which does not pay a high salary. With his limited income, he pays\nthe loan on his father\u2019s house and his monthly living expenses. He pays support for his\ntwo children without a court order. He complies with the terms of his one debt\nrepayment plan. He recently incurred two significant repair bills for work done on his\n\n10\n \n \n2001 truck, which he is paying. He acts responsibly towards his current bills and has\ndecided against the use of credit cards. \nIn 2004, Applicant\u2019s father agreed to a $25,000 equity loan on his house to pay\noff Applicant\u2019s accumulated credit card debt. Shortly after resolving all his credit card\ndebt, Applicant acquired new and significant credit card debt when he lost his job. He\nhas resolved about 25% of his old debts. Recognizing that his income prevents him\nfrom paying all the debts immediately, his failure to resolve some of the smaller debts\nwhen he had extra income raises questions about the strength of his commitment to pay\nhis debts at this time. When he completed his security clearance application, he falsified\nhis answer about delinquent debts and clearly intended to do so. This is a serious lapse\nof judgment on his part, which is a primary reason his clearance is denied. At the\nhearing, he explained his reasons for his conduct. He presented himself in a forthright\nand honest manner, not only about his falsification, but also when explaining his reason\nfor not properly answering the question. His decision to send money to support two\nchildren he does not see indicates that he is a responsible individual. In much of his\ndaily life, he is a reliable, dependable, hardworking, and honest person. He has learned\nthat in the future he must answer security-related questions honestly.\nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s\neligibility and suitability for a security clearance at this time.

Duffy, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro Se \n \n \n \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nDAM, Shari, Administrative Judge: \n \n \nBased upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility \nfor access to classified information is denied. \n \nOn September 27, 2007, Applicant submitted a Questionnaire for Sensitive \nPositions (SF 86). On November 14, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals \n(DOHA) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR), detailing security concerns \nunder Guideline F (Financial Considerations). The action was taken under Executive \nOrder 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), \nas amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the \nrevised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, \n2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September \n1, 2006.  \n  \nMarch 31, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n \n \nOn January 2, 2009, Applicant answered the SOR in writing and elected to have \nthe case decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. On January 29, 2009, \nDepartment Counsel prepared a File of Relevant Material (FORM) containing nine \nItems, and mailed Applicant a complete copy on February 2, 2009. Applicant received \nthe FORM on February 9, 2009, and had 30 days from its receipt to file objections and \nsubmit additional information. On March 2, 2009, Applicant submitted a letter indicating \nthat he had no objections to the FORM and had no additional information. On March 16, \n2009, DOHA assigned the case to me.  \n \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted all factual allegations contained in \nthe SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.w.  \n  \n \nApplicant is 43 years old and divorced. He has two children and two-step \nchildren.  From 2000 until June 2007, he worked for several different companies until he \nobtained a job, as a laborer, with a federal contractor. (Items 5, 6) \n \n \nIn June and July 2008 (before the issuance of the SOR), Applicant completed \nsets of Interrogatories related to his finances. He started having financial difficulties \napproximately three years prior to completing the Interrogatories because he had low \npaying jobs without health care benefits, purchased too many items on credit and failed \nto live within his financial means. According to the budget he submitted in July 2008, his \nnet monthly income was $1,400 and his expenses were about $2,453, indicating a \n$1,000 monthly deficit. In both sets of Interrogatories, he asserted that he intended to \nseek financial assistance to help manage his debts and finances. (Items 6, 7) With his \nnew position and income, he thinks he should be able to address them. (Item 6) \n \n \nBased on credit bureau reports (CBR) dated September 28, 2007, and March 25, \n2008, the SOR alleged 23 delinquent debts, totaling $41,214. All of the debts remain \nunpaid or unresolved. They consist of debts owed to credit card companies, department \nstores and a utility company. Several debts are for medical services, which he \nseemingly incurred while he was without insurance, and one is for unpaid child support, \nwhich he asserted is paid. (Item 7)  \n \n \n \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching \n\n \n3 \n \n \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. According to Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant \nis responsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel and has \nthe ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions adverse to an \napplicant shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also Executive Order \n12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive \ninformation). \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG & 18:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \n\n \n4 \n \n \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \n The guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under \nAG & 19, two of them are potentially disqualifying: \n \n(a) an inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \nBased on two CBRs and his admissions, Applicant has been unable or unwilling \nto satisfy debts that began accruing since 2005. The evidence is sufficient to raise these \ntwo disqualifying conditions.  \n \nAfter the Government raised potential disqualifications, the burden shifted to \nApplicant to rebut and prove mitigation of the resulting security concerns. The guideline \nincludes six examples of conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising from \nfinancial difficulties under AG \u00b6 20: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n \n (b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the \nproblem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue \ncreditors or otherwise resolve debts; and  \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy \nof the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue; and \n \n(f) the affluence resulted from a legal source of income.   \n \nApplicant\u2019s numerous financial delinquencies have been ongoing since 2005, \nand do not appear to have arisen out of unusual circumstance. Hence, AG \u00b6 2 (a) \n\n \n5 \n \n \ncannot apply. Applicant attributed some of the financial difficulties to periods of low \npaying positions and a lack of medical insurance. However, there is no evidence in the \nrecord indicating that he responsibly managed his finances during those difficult \nperiods, which is necessary for full application of this mitigating condition. Thus, AG & \n20(b) has limited application. Applicant did not present any evidence that he received \ncredit counseling or that the 23 delinquent debts are resolved or under control, as \nrequired under AG & 20(c). Applicant has not paid or initiated repayment of any debt; \nhence, AG & 20(d) does not apply.1 There is no evidence indicating that he disputed \nany of the debts, which is required under AG & 20(e). The record does not support the \napplication of AG & 20(f).  \n  \n Whole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a). They include the following:  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is 43-years old and has \nworked for a federal contractor since June 2007. In July 2008, he learned of the \nGovernment\u2019s concerns about his finances and indicated that he would begin resolving \nthem. In November 2008, he again received notice of those concerns through the SOR, \nbut did not take steps or submit any information indicating that he was attempting to \nresolve the debts and establish a workable budget. Without such proof, there is \ninsufficient information in the record to mitigate the financial concerns. His failure to \naddress the issues over the past couple years, raises questions about his judgment.  \n \n  Overall, the record evidence leaves me with doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility \nand suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant failed \nto mitigate the security concerns arising from his financial issues.  \n                                                          \n1 Applicant indicated that his child support payments are current, but did not provide any evidence \nto support his statement. \n\n \n6 \n \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.w:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance.

Theodore Hammer, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nRICCIARDELLO, Carol G., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant failed to mitigate the Government\u2019s security concerns under Guideline \nF, Financial Considerations. Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance is denied. \n \nOn July 23, 2010, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued \nApplicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under Guideline F. \nThe action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense \nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) \neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on August 18, 2010, and requested a \nhearing before an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on September \n23, 2010. DOHA issued a Notice of Hearing on September 28, 2010. I convened the \nhearing as scheduled on October 28, 2010. The Government offered Exhibits (GE) 1 \nthrough 13. Applicant did not object and they were admitted. Applicant testified on his \n \n1 \n \n \nNovember 22, 2010\n\n \n2 \n \n \n                                                          \nown behalf. Applicant offered Exhibits (AE) A through D, which were admitted without \nobjections. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on November 4, 2010.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant admitted all of the allegations in the SOR. After a thorough and careful \nreview of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of fact. \n \n \nApplicant is 39 years and a high school graduate. He has taken some college \ncourses. He served in the Navy from 1990 to 1999, and received a General Discharge \nunder Honorable Conditions. He married in 1992 and divorced in 1996. He has two \nchildren from the marriage, ages 18 and 16. He remarried in 1996 and divorced in 2002. \nHe has no children from the marriage. He remarried again in 2003, and has two children \nfrom the marriage, ages six and two, and one stepchild who is 11 years old.1  \n \n \nApplicant stated that when he was married to his first wife she used a power of \nattorney he had given to her, to make purchases beyond their means. He was a third \nclass petty officer (E-4) at the time. He could not afford to pay the debts. He worked for \na period of time with a credit service to pay $1,500 a month to resolve the debts, but \nwas unable to maintain the payments. He stated he was awarded the debts in the \ndivorce. He filed Chapter 7 bankruptcy after his divorce in 1996. He had approximately \n$52,000 of consumer debt discharged.2 \n \n \nApplicant and his second wife both had well-paying jobs when they married. She \nearned approximately $165,000, and he earned approximately $85,000. They owned a \nhome and due to the commute from where Applicant worked, he had an apartment. His \nwife boarded horses. They separated in October 2002 and divorced in July 2003. \nApplicant was awarded the house in the divorce. He placed it for sale sometime in \n2003, and it sold a few months later. He did not make a profit on it, instead he broke \neven. They had approximately $40,000 of consumer debt.3  \n \n \nApplicant married in October 2003. He did not have sufficient credit to get a loan \nto buy a house. His wife earned $27,000, and she qualified for a $389,000 loan to \npurchase a house for them. Applicant gave her $10,000 to use as the down payment on \nthe house. They purchased the house in December 2003. The house was in his wife\u2019s \nname only.4  \n \n \nIn June 2004, Applicant filed Chapter 7 bankruptcy for the debts he had incurred \nwith his second wife. He had approximately $40,000 in consumer credit debt discharged \n \n1 Tr. 127-131, 157-159. \n \n2 Tr. 103-113; AE A. \n \n3 Tr. 113-121. \n \n4 Tr. 113-127, 132-134, 139. \n\n \n3 \n \n \n                                                          \nin September 2004. Applicant stated he did not know why he did not use the $10,000 he \ngave to his wife for the down payment on a house, to pay his consumer debts. Applicant \nand his third wife had a child in June 2004. His wife stopped working sometime in \n2004.5 \n \n \nApplicant and his wife lived in the house she purchased for one year and sold it \nto buy another house in December 2004. She made a $35,000 profit on the house they \nsold. They used the profit to pay outstanding bills incurred to improve the home before it \nsold and pay other debts. 6 \n \nApplicant stated that they obtained a mortgage in 2004 for $499,000, with an \nadjustable interest rate for five years to buy the house. He used $28,000 for a down \npayment. He actually had two mortgages with a 80/20 split for financing. Ten months \nlater, they refinanced a mortgage on the house for $599,000 and took $100,000 from \nthe loan. Applicant stated he believed the new loan also had a five-year adjustable \ninterest rate. However, before signing the new loan, he questioned why the contract \nstated it was a two-year adjustable interest rate. He was told by the realtor not to worry, \nit would get fixed. He anticipated refinancing the loan in the future, so he did not worry. \nThere is some confusion regarding the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.a. which Applicant stated is a \nsecond mortgage. It does not appear this debt was included when the larger loan was \nrefinanced and it remains owed.7 \n \nApplicant estimated they used about $20,000 to pay bills, and $60,000 to \nupgrade the house. He did not know how they spent the remaining $20,000. Applicant \nmade the monthly loan payments until the adjustable rate went up. He stated he was \nunaware the rates would increase every six months. In January 2007, he filed Chapter \n13 bankruptcy in an attempt to save the house. He paid the mortgage until November \n2007. In January 2008, he and his family moved out of the house. The house was sold \nin April 2008. There was a deficiency on the mortgage and Applicant received an \nInternal Revenue Service (IRS) form 1099. His Chapter 13 bankruptcy was dismissed at \nhis request in April 2009, because the house was foreclosed. He stated he was \nunaware he owed the deficiency on the second mortgage.8   \n \nApplicant took a $7,000 loan from his 401(k) pension plan in 2002 to purchase a \nhouse. He repaid the loan by 2004. In 2006, he withdrew $17,000 from his 401(k) \npension plan. He received a letter from the IRS in 2009, demanding payment for the \nunpaid taxes. The letter also included notice that he failed to pay the amount due on his \n2008 income taxes. Applicant was aware that he underpaid his 2008 taxes. He did not \nset up a payment plan to pay his 2008 income taxes when he filed his taxes. It was not \n \n5 Tr. 124, 131, 134. \n \n6 Tr. 139-143. \n \n7 Tr. 26, 57-70. \n \n8 Tr. 21-22, 26-50, 57, 70-73, 79-88. \n\n \n4 \n \n \n                                                          \nuntil the IRS contacted him that he made a payment arrangement to pay both debts. \nApplicant pays $200 a month towards the 2006 and 2008 tax debt. The 2006 tax debt is \nlisted in SOR \u00b6 1.b. He believes he currently owes approximately $10,000 on this debt \nto the IRS. The 2008 tax debt is approximately $4,000. He stated he was unaware he \nhad to pay taxes on his 401(k) withdrawal.9  \n \nApplicant\u2019s 2004 Chapter 7 bankruptcy documents list unpaid income taxes for \n2001 and 2002, in the amount of $9,000. Applicant admitted this debt was because he \ndid not have sufficient funds withheld from his income. He stated the taxes were paid by \nthe IRS confiscating his tax refunds and his payment of the balance.10 \n \nApplicant recently took another loan of $3,000 from his 401(k) pension plan. He \nused this money to move his family to another state. He stated he has no credit cards \nand his wife has one credit card with no balance owed. He and his family are living with \nrelatives and plan to rent instead of buying a house. He consistently pays his child \nsupport. When he was working full-time his salary was $110,000. He stated he has a \nbudget.11  \n \nApplicant stated he has $29,000 on hand from his savings which includes a \n$17,000 loan from his 401(k) pension plan. He wants to use this money to negotiate a \nsettlement with the mortgage company for his second mortgage debt, for which he owes \n$118,000. He hopes to resolve the debt with a lump sum settlement. The mortgage \ncompany has been unwilling to accept reduced monthly payments.12  \n \nApplicant provided a statement from his wife explaining their reason for filing \nChapter 7 bankruptcy. She explained it was because of debts remaining from his prior \nmarriage and his ex-wife\u2019s failure to pay debts from the marriage.13 \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \n \n9 Tr. 50-57, 89-98. \n \n10 Tr. 98-103; GE 6. \n \n11 Tr. 143-150, 153. \n \n12 Tr. 40-47, 74-79, 162; AE C, D. \n \n13 AE B. \n\n \n5 \n \n \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern for Financial Considerations is set out in AG & 18:  \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \n\n \n6 \n \n \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. I have \nconsidered all of the disqualifying conditions under AG & 19 and especially considered: \n \n(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \nApplicant filed Chapter 7 bankruptcy in 1996 and had $56,000 of debt \ndischarged. He filed Chapter 7 bankruptcy in 2004 and had $40,000 of debt discharged. \nHe filed Chapter 13 bankruptcy in 2009, and it was dismissed. Applicant failed to pay to \nthe IRS the penalty and taxes owed on a withdrawal from his pension plan. He also \nfailed to pay his 2008 taxes on time. He has a delinquent second mortgage that is \nunpaid. I find there is sufficient evidence to raise these disqualifying conditions.  \n \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns \narising from financial difficulties. I have considered the following mitigating conditions \nunder AG \u00b6 20: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control;  \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue.  \n \n \nApplicant had $56,000 in debt discharged under Chapter 7 bankruptcy in 1996. \nHe owed approximately $40,000 in consumer debt when he and his second wife \ndivorced in 2003. Instead of paying his consumer debt, he gave his third wife $10,000 to \n\n \n7 \n \n \nuse as a down payment to purchase a house. A few months later, he filed Chapter 7 \nbankruptcy and had $40,000 of debt discharged. He was aware he owed his 2008 taxes \nand did not pay them. He also owed taxes for his 2006 pension plan withdrawal. He has \na payment plan with the IRS for unpaid taxes, but did not begin the plan until he was \ncontacted by the IRS about the delinquent taxes. The second mortgage loan is not paid. \nApplicant hopes to reach a settlement agreement with the creditor. I find mitigating \ncondition AG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply. Applicant has a long history of not paying his \ndebts. He failed to modify his past behavior. I am unconvinced that his behavior will not \nrecur. Applicant blames his first wife\u2019s irresponsible use of a power of attorney for \ncausing him to file Chapter 7 bankruptcy in 1996. However, Applicant has a record of \naccumulating consumer debts and not repaying them, even though he earns a \nsubstantial salary.  \n \n \nTo a certain extent, some of Applicant\u2019s debts, might have been beyond his \ncontrol, due to his divorces. However, I find he has failed to act responsibly under the \ncircumstances. He had funds to pay some of his delinquent debts, but chose to use the \nmoney for a down payment on a house, and shortly thereafter filed Chapter 7 \nbankruptcy. I find AG \u00b6 20(b) partially applies.  \n \n \nApplicant offered no information that he has received financial counseling. He did \nnot take action to resolve his tax debts until the IRS contacted him. He continues to owe \nmore than $118,000 on his second mortgage. He hopes to settle the debt, but it has not \nyet happened. I find Applicant has not made good-faith efforts to resolve his debts. I do \nnot find that there are clear indications his finances are under control. I find AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(c) \nand 20(d) do not apply. In addition, I find there is no evidence to support application of \nAG\u00b6 20(e).  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        \n\n \n8 \n \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(a) were \naddressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. Applicant has a \nhistory of financial problems. Twice he resolved the problems by having his debts \ndischarged in Chapter 7 bankruptcy. Despite having a clean financial record, he again \naccumulated delinquent debts. He has a long record of poor financial decisions. He \nfailed to pay his tax debt until the IRS contacted him. He repeatedly was irresponsible in \nhow he used his resources. Overall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and \ndoubts about Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these \nreasons, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns arising under the \nguideline for Financial Considerations.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.f: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with national interest to grant Applicant a security clearance. Eligibility \nfor access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nCarol G.

Borgstrom, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nFOREMAN, LeRoy F., Administrative Judge: \n \nThis case involves security concerns raised under Guidelines E (Personal \nConduct) and J (Criminal Conduct). Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to Sensitive \nCompartmented Information (SCI) was revoked for drug abuse in May 2005, under \nDCID 6/4, as amended by Intelligence Community Policy Memorandum 2006-700-3, \ndated July 12, 2006; and that action became final when his appeal was denied in \nAugust 2007. This case concerns Applicant\u2019s collateral security clearance, which was \nnot revoked. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application on November 8, 2005 \n(Government Exhibit (GX) 3). On May 28, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its \npreliminary decision to deny his application, citing security concerns under Guidelines E \nand J. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense \nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) \npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005.  \nNovember 25, 2008\n\n \n \n2\n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on June 3, 2008; answered it on \nJune 18, 2008; and requested determination on the record without a hearing. DOHA \nreceived his response on June 23, 2008. Department Counsel submitted the \ngovernment\u2019s written case on August 31, 2008. On September 4, 2008, a complete \ncopy of the file of relevant material (FORM) was sent to Applicant, who was afforded an \nopportunity to file objections and submit material to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the \ngovernment\u2019s evidence. Applicant received the FORM on September 15, 2008, and he \ndid not respond. The case was assigned to me on November 19, 2008.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted all the allegations. His admissions \nare incorporated in my findings of fact.  \n \n \nApplicant is a 51-year-old principal contract administrator for a defense \ncontractor. He has worked for his current employer since June 1980 and held a \nclearance since June 1983. He was married in September 1955 and has a 28-year-old \ndaughter.  \n \n \nApplicant was interviewed by a security investigator in August 1999 in connection \nwith his application for SCI eligibility. He admitted he started using marijuana in high \nschool around 1974 and used it on a monthly basis with friends on weekends until about \n1980. From 1980 until December 1996, he used it occasionally at parties or vacations \nwith family members. He told the investigator he stopped using marijuana in December \n1996 because he had matured and he learned his employer had instituted mandatory \ndrug testing (GX 7 at 1). \n \n \nAt some time in 2000, while his application for SCI was being processed, \nApplicant used marijuana once (GX 5 at 5). He was granted SCI eligibility in March \n2000, but cautioned in writing that any further drug abuse would result in revocation of \nhis SCI eligibility (GX 6 at 17). He used marijuana once again in 2003 with his brother \nand cousins at a family picnic (GX 6 at 11).  \n \n \nWhen Applicant submitted his e-QIP in November 2005, he answered \u201cno\u201d to \nquestion 24a, asking if he had illegally used any controlled substance, including \nmarijuana, during the last seven years. He did not disclose his use of marijuana in 2000 \nand 2003. He also answered \u201cno\u201d to question 24b, asking if he had ever used a \ncontrolled substance while possessing a security clearance. He did not disclose his use \nof marijuana after receiving a secret clearance in June 1983 and a top secret clearance \nand access to SCI in June 2000. \n \n \nIn April 2007, Applicant\u2019s access to SCI was suspended after he tested positive \nfor marijuana in March 2007. Applicant explained to a security investigator that he and \nhis brothers smoked marijuana while grieving after their father\u2019s funeral on the day \nbefore the urinalysis. He disclosed his marijuana use to his wife (GX 5 3-4).  \n \nAfter Applicant\u2019s positive urinalysis, he was ordered to obtain drug counseling as \na condition of continued employment. He completed the one-hour session that was \n\n \n \n3\nrequired. At the recommendation of the counselor, he attended four one-hour grief \ncounseling sessions in March and April 2007. The counselor did not provide a prognosis \n(GX 5 at 5). Applicant access to SCI was revoked in May 2007 (GX 6 at 2). His appeal \nof that decision was denied in August 2007 (GX 6 at 1). \n \nIn his answer to the SOR, Applicant stated his conduct was \u201can aberration rather \nthan the norm.\u201d He offered to undergo increased random drug testing, polygraph \nexamination or other measures at any interval, at his own expense if necessary, in order \nto receive another chance to retain a clearance. \n \nPolicies \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \ncontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.   \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not \ninflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common \nsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no \nsense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. Or. \n10865 \u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is not necessarily a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  It is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \n \n \nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\n \n \n4\n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).   \n \n \nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity \nclearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 \nU.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \n \nThe SOR alleges Applicant\u2019s top secret/SCI access was suspended by another \ngovernment agency in April 2007 based on a positive drug test for marijuana (SOR \u00b6 \n1.a); he used marijuana from 1974 through 1996, and in the late 1990s, 2000, 2003, \nand March 13, 2007 (SOR \u00b6 1.b); he used marijuana after being issued a clearance in \nJune 1983 (SOR \u00b6 1.c); he used marijuana after signing receipt of a letter on March 13, \n2000 informing him that illegal drug involvement would result of revocation of access to \nSCI (SOR \u00b6 1.d); he continued to use marijuana after receiving a top secret/SCI \nclearance in June 2000 (SOR \u00b6 1.e); and he falsified his security clearance application \nby not disclosing his drug involvement (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f and 1.g). \n \n \nThe documentary evidence reflects that Applicant\u2019s SCI eligibility was suspended \nin April 2007 and revoked in May 2007, but there is no evidence that his top secret \ncollateral clearance was revoked at that time. Thus, the allegation in SOR \u00b6 1.a that \nApplicant\u2019s top secret clearance was suspended in April 2007 is not supported by \nsubstantial evidence. \n \n \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 15: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.   \n \n \nThe following disqualifying conditions under this guideline are relevant to \nApplicant\u2019s drug involvement:  \n \n[C]redible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \n\n \n \n5\ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply \nwith rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the \nperson may not properly safeguard protected information, . . . [including] a \npattern of dishonesty or rule violations (AG \u00b6 16(d)); and \n \n[P]ersonal conduct, or concealment of information about one's conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress, such \nas . . . engaging in activities which, if known, may affect the person's \npersonal, professional, or community standing (AG \u00b6 16(e)).  \n \n \nThe reference in AG \u00b6 16(a) to \u201cinformation that is not explicitly covered under \nany other guideline\u201d does not preclude consideration of Applicant\u2019s drug abuse under \nGuideline E instead of Guideline H (Drug Involvement). The Appeal Board has \ndetermined that the language in Guideline E does not \u201cfundamentally alter the history, \nscope, and purpose of Guideline E.\u201d Instead, the new language \u201ccontinues the \nlongstanding tenet that specific behavior can have security significance under more \nthan one guideline and . . . by focusing on the concepts of questionable judgment and \nirresponsibility, it contemplates that behavior will have independent security significance \nunder Guideline E in a broad range of cases.\u201d ISCR Case No. 06-20964, 2008 WL \n2002589 at *5 (App. Bd. Apr. 10, 2008). I conclude that Applicant\u2019s history of drug \nabuse before and after he received a security clearance and eligibility for access to SCI \nraise AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(d) and (3) under Guideline E. \n \n \nThe relevant disqualifying condition for Applicant\u2019s falsifications of his security \nclearance application is \u201cdeliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant \nfacts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award \nbenefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award \nfiduciary responsibilities.\u201d AG \u00b6 16(a). Applicant\u2019s admission that he falsified his \nanswers to questions 24a and 24b on his application raises this disqualifying condition. \n \n \nSince the government produced substantial evidence to raise the disqualifying \nconditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(a), (d), and (e), the burden shifted to Applicant to produce \nevidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An \napplicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, and the burden of disproving \nit never shifts to the government. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, \n2005).  \n \n \nSecurity concerns based on falsification of a security clearance application may \nbe mitigated if \u201cthe individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts.\u201d AG \u00b6 17(a). \nApplicant submitted his application in November 2005, but he did not disclose his post-\n1996 marijuana use until he was interviewed by an investigator after his positive \nurinalysis in March 2007. This mitigating condition is not established. \n \n\n \n \n6\n \nSecurity concerns based on personal conduct may be mitigated if \u201cthe offense is \nso minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is so infrequent, or it happened \nunder such unique circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on \nthe individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d AG \u00b6 17(c). Although \nindividual instances of marijuana use might arguably be considered \u201cminor,\u201d Applicant\u2019s \nlong history of marijuana use, his multiple breaches of trust by using marijuana while \nholding a clearance, and his concealment of his marijuana use on his security clearance \napplication, are not minor when considered together. Thus, I conclude the first prong of \nAG \u00b6 17(c) (\u201cso minor\u201d) is not established.  \n \nThe second prong of AG \u00b6 17(c) (\u201cso much time\u201d) focuses on the recentness of \nthe conduct. There are no Abright line@ rules for determining when conduct is Arecent.@ \nThe determination must be based on a careful evaluation of the totality of the evidence. \nISCR Case No. 02-24452 at 6 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2004). If the evidence shows Aa \nsignificant period of time has passed without any evidence of misconduct,@ then an \nadministrative judge must determine whether that period of time demonstrates Achanged \ncircumstances or conduct sufficient to warrant a finding of reform or rehabilitation.@ Id. \nApplicant\u2019s last marijuana use was in March 2007, about 15 months before the SOR \nwas issued. In light of his lifelong history of marijuana use, continuing with periodic use \nin 2000, 2003, and 2007, I am not satisfied sufficient time has passed to warrant a \nfinding of rehabilitation. I conclude the second prong of AG \u00b6 17(c) is not established. \n \n \nAlthough his father\u2019s funeral might be considered a \u201cunique circumstance,\u201d most \nof Applicant\u2019s marijuana use has been in social and family situations. The totality of his \nbehavior casts doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness and good judgment. I conclude \nAG \u00b6 17(c) is not established. \n \n \nSecurity concerns can be mitigated if \u201cthe individual has acknowledged the \nbehavior and obtained counseling to change the behavior or taken other positive steps \nto alleviate the stressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur\u201d AG \u00b6 \n17(d). Applicant received one hour of mandatory drug counseling, and he voluntarily \nreceived about four hours of grief counseling. Given his lifetime of drug abuse, multiple \nbreaches of trust, and falsification of his e-QIP, I am not convinced his behavior is \n\u201cunlikely to recur.\u201d I conclude AG \u00b6 17(d) is not established.  \n \n \nFinally, security concerns may be mitigated if \u201cthe individual has taken positive \nsteps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress.\u201d AG \u00b6 \n17(e). It appears that Applicant\u2019s spouse, family members, and supervisors are aware of \nhis drug abuse, but their awareness is not based on Applicant\u2019s \u201cpositive steps.\u201d The \nrecord does not reflect whether Applicant\u2019s coworkers, neighbors, or his daughter are \naware of his conduct. I conclude AG \u00b6 17(e) is not established. \n \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct \n \n \nThe SOR cross-alleges Applicant\u2019s falsification of his security clearance \napplication under this guideline. The concern raised by criminal conduct is set out in AG \n\u00b6 30 as follows: \u201cCriminal conduct creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, \n\n \n \n7\nand trustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person's ability or \nwillingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations.\u201d AG \u00b6 30. Conditions that could \nraise a security concern and may be disqualifying include \u201ca single serious crime or \nmultiple lesser offenses\u201d and \u201callegation or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the person was formally charged, formally prosecuted, or convicted.\u201d AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n31(a) and (c). \n \n \nIt is a felony, punishable by a fine or imprisonment for not more than five years, \nor both, to knowingly and willfully make any materially false, fictitious, or fraudulent \nstatement or representation in any matter within the jurisdiction of the executive branch \nof the government of the United States. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001. Security clearances are \nmatters within the jurisdiction of the executive branch of the government of the United \nStates. A deliberately false answer on a security clearance application is a serious \ncrime within the meaning of Guideline J.  Applicant\u2019s lifelong illegal marijuana use and \nhis deliberate concealment of his marijuana use raise the disqualifying conditions in AG \n\u00b6 31(a) and (c). \n \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline may be mitigated by evidence that \u201cso \nmuch time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it happened under \nsuch unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d AG \u00b6 32(a). They also may be \nmitigated if, \u201cthere is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited to \nthe passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or restitution, job \ntraining or higher education, good employment record, or constructive community \ninvolvement.\u201d AG \u00b6 32(d). For the reasons set out in the above discussion of AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n17(c) and (d) under Guideline E, I conclude AG \u00b6\u00b6 32(a) and (d) are not established.  \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guidelines E and J in my whole person analysis. Some of the factors \n\n \n \n8\nin AG \u00b6 2(a) were addressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional \ncomment. \n \n \nApplicant is a mature adult who has spent his life employed by defense \ncontractors, but he also has used marijuana for most of his adult life. He has held a \nclearance for many years, but he has breached the trust implicit in a security clearance \nby continuing his marijuana use and concealing it from his employer. After weighing the \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guidelines E and J, and evaluating all the \nevidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the \nsecurity concerns based on personal conduct and criminal conduct. Accordingly, I \nconclude he has not carried his burden of showing that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to continue his eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nI make the following formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set \nforth in the SOR, as required by Directive \u00b6 E3.1.25: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline E (Personal Conduct):  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.g: \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline J (Criminal Conduct):  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to \nclassified information is denied. \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \nLeRoy F. Foreman \nAdministrative Judge \n",

The action was taken under Executive Order\n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1990), as\namended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel\nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive);\nDepartment of Defense (DoD) Regulation 5200.2-R, Personnel Security Program, dated\nJanuary, 1987, as amended (Regulation); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG)\npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the\nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \nOn November 27, 2009, Applicant answered the SOR. She elected to have her\ncase decided on the record in lieu of a hearing. Department Counsel submitted the\nMarch 3, 2010\n\n     The government submitted 15 items in support of the allegations.\n1\n2\ngovernment\u2019s written case on December 24, 2009.   Applicant received a complete file\n1\nof relevant material (FORM) on December 31, 2009, and was provided the opportunity\nto file objections, and submit material to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the government\u2019s\ncase. Applicant submitted a letter, undated, received on January 4, 2010. DOHA\nassigned the case to me on February 19, 2010. Based upon a review of the case file,\npleadings, and exhibits, Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a public trust position is denied.\nFindings of Fact \nIn her Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the factual allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.d,\n3.b, 3.k, and 3.s. She denied the remaining allegations in the SOR. \nApplicant is a 31-year-old employee of a defense contractor. She graduated from\nhigh school in 1997, and attended a technical school from August 2003 until March\n2006. She is single and has four daughters. She has worked for her current employer\nsince December 2006 (Item 4).\nIn April 1996, Applicant was arrested and charged with forgery, burglary, criminal\nconspiracy, and armed robbery. She pled guilty to all charges and was sentenced to\nfive years confinement and court costs (Item 11). Applicant was incarcerated from\nJanuary 1999 until January 2002 (Item 9). Applicant indicated that she drove two\nacquaintances to an unspecified location. The two individuals were involved in an\narmed robbery (Item 5). \nApplicant was charged with breach of trust with fraudulent intent in November\n1998. She paid a fine of less than $250 (Item 8). She claimed she wrote a check that\nwas \u201cdishonored\u201d (Item 12). \nIn July 2006, Applicant was arrested and charged with financial identity fraud.\nShe was convicted and sentenced to three years confinement and a $100 fine (Item 6).\nApplicant\u2019s sentence was converted to probation for one year, which she completed in\n2007. Applicant denied that she was guilty of identity fraud (Response to FORM). \nApplicant completed a Questionnaire for Public Trust Positions on December 9,\n2006. She answered \u201cYes\u201d to Section 20 asking whether she had been convicted of any\noffense in the last 7 years. She disclosed a speeding ticket. Applicant did not disclose\nher 2006 conviction for financial identity fraud. She explained that she made restitution\nfor the underlying incident (Applicant\u2019s answer to FORM).\nIn an interview with a Department of Defense (DoD) investigator conducted on\nMarch 23, 2007, Applicant denied any direct involvement before, during, or after the\narmed robbery in 1996 (Item 5). She claimed she had no idea that the passengers in\nher vehicle were engaged in armed robbery. She stated she learned of the incident\napproximately ten days later. She admits pleading guilty and being incarcerated, but\nshe believes she was a victim of circumstances and was wrongly incarcerated (Item 5).\n\n3\nThe police report (Item 9) reflects that Applicant was in her vehicle before the robbery,\nand she picked up the two individuals as they were fleeing the scene.\nIn an interview on January 30, 2008, Applicant reported to the DoD investigator\nthat she drove two individuals to a mall but again denied any direct involvement with the\n1995 armed robbery (Item 5). \nApplicant signed an affidavit on February 19, 2009. She again denied any direct\ninvolvement with the 1995 armed robbery. Despite the police reports, documentation\nfrom the FBI record, her guilty pleas, and other documents in the record, Applicant\nmaintained that she \u201cnever participated in any events\u201d and was not guilty of any of the\ncriminal incidents for which she was incarcerated (Item 12). \nIn Applicant\u2019s December 2009, response to the FORM, she stated that after\nreading the file in depth, the items that were listed on the SOR for which she was\narrested were correct \u201cbut the circumstances surrounding the situations were not\ncorrect or accurate.\u201d Applicant acknowledged that the deliberate omissions in her\nDecember 9, 2006, Standard Form 85P and subsequent interviews constitute violations\nof 10 U.S.C. Section 1001, which is a felony (Item 2).\nAt issue are the following delinquent debts totaling approximately $9,356, as\nreflected in a credit report (Item 14), and as noted in the SOR as allegations \u00b6\u00b6 1.a\nthrough 1.t under Guideline F (Financial Considerations).\nIn choosing an administrative decision, Applicant chose to rely on the written\nrecord. The facts she submitted with regard to her past and her financial situation are\nlimited to her answer to the SOR allegations, in which she stated:\nIn regards to my credit report, there are several items on there in dispute\nwith companies. I have items with Alltel and Verizon where I co-signed for\nindividual family members for cell phones. They failed to honor their\ncontract and these items showed up on my credit report. I am in the\nprocess of working out payments with some of the companies to payoff\nsome of these accounts.\nThe delinquent debts are comprised of debts referred to collection or charged-off\nin 2003 and 2005 (Item 6). Applicant did not disclose information as to what gave rise to\nthe majority of these obligations. She did list two other accounts on her 2006 SF 85P\nthat were 180 days delinquent.  No indication is given as to whether she ever pursued\nfinancial counseling or has made any efforts to address the debts at issue. Applicant\ndenied the majority of the delinquent debts but did not submit any documentation to\nsubstantiate the basis of a legitimate  dispute. Despite her assertion that she is in the\nprocess of \u201cworking out payments\u201d, she has not demonstrated that any debt has been\nresolved. Applicant did not provide any evidence regarding her current financial\nsituation.  \n\n4\nPolicies\nPositions designated as ADP I and ADP II are classified as \u201csensitive positions.\u201d\n(See Regulation \u00b6\u00b6 C3.1.2.1.1.7 and C3.1.2.1.2.3.)  \u201cThe standard that must be met for\n. . . assignment to sensitive duties is that, based on all available information, the\nperson\u2019s loyalty, reliability, and trustworthiness are such that . . . assigning the person to\nsensitive duties is clearly consistent with the interests of national security.\u201d (See\nRegulation \u00b6 C6.1.1.1.) The Deputy Under Secretary of Defense (Counterintelligence\nand Security) Memorandum, dated November 19, 2004, indicates trustworthiness\nadjudications will apply to cases forwarded to DOHA by the Defense Security Service\nand Office of Personnel Management. Department of Defense contractor personnel are\nafforded the right to the procedures contained in the Directive before any final\nunfavorable access determination may be made. (See Regulation \u00b6 C8.2.1.)  \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a public trust position, the\nadministrative judge must consider the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the AG.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of\nhuman behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in\nthe adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a\nfair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is\na conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d\nThe administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the\nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\n[sensitive] information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based\non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable\ntrustworthiness decision. \nA person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\ngovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to sensitive information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard sensitive information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nsensitive information.\n\n5\nSection 7 of Executive Order (EO) 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin\nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty\nof the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple\nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct\nAG \u00b6 30 expresses the trustworthiness concern pertaining to criminal conduct,\n\u201cCriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and\ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability or willingness\nto comply with laws, rules, and regulations.\u201d\nAG \u00b6 31 describes conditions that could raise a concern and may be\ndisqualifying, (a), \u201ca single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses,\u201d and \u00b6 31(c),\n\u201callegation or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was\nformally charged, formally prosecuted, or convicted\u201d. \nApplicant was arrested in 1996, and pled guilty to forgery, burglary, criminal\nconspiracy, and armed robbery in 1999. She was incarcerated from 1999 until 2002.\nShe was charged in 1998, and fined for breach of trust with fraudulent intent. She was\narrested in 2006, and convicted for financial identity fraud. She served one year\nprobation, which ended in 2007. She intentionally falsified her SF 85P in December\n2006, and made false statements in subsequent interviews with government officials,\nwhich is a violation of 10 U. S. C. Section 1001.  AG \u00b6 31(a), and 31(c) apply.\nAG \u00b6 32 provides conditions that could mitigate concerns:\n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it\nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur\nand does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or\ngood judgment, and\n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation, including but not limited\nto the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or\nrestitution, job training or higher education, good employment record, or\nconstructive community involvement.\nNone of the mitigating conditions apply. Applicant has a history of engaging in\ncriminal behavior, including a history of offenses involving a lack of integrity. She has\nbeen convicted of forgery and fraud offenses, in addition to burglary, conspiracy, and\narmed robbery. Her prior criminal history involves conduct demonstrating a lack of\ntrustworthiness. She provided false information in her SF 85P in 2006. She has\nminimalized or denied her criminal actions, despite her convictions and the documented\npolice and FBI records. She presented insufficient evidence to support mitigation. \n\n6\nGuideline E, Personal Conduct\nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the concern pertaining to personal conduct, \u201cConduct\ninvolving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply\nwith rules and regulations can raise questions about an individual's reliability,\ntrustworthiness and ability to protect classified information.\u201d \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be\ndisqualifying. Under AG \u00b6 16(a), a disqualifying condition exists when there is\n\u201cdeliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any personnel\nsecurity questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to conduct\ninvestigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status,\ndetermine security eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities.\u201d\nUnder 16(b), a disqualifying condition exists when \u201cdeliberately providing false or\nmisleading information concerning relevant facts to an employer, investigator, security\nofficial, competent medical authority, or other official government representative.\u201d \nOn December 9, 2006, Applicant signed her SF 85P, in which she deliberately\nfalsified her application by not disclosing her 2006 arrest and conviction for financial\nidentity fraud. She was still on probation. She instead listed a speeding ticket and a\nfine. In 2007 and 2008 interviews, Applicant deliberately misled officials about her 1996\ninvolvement in an armed robbery. She signed an affidavit in 2009, that again provided\nstatements that she never participated in the events and that she was not at fault.\nThese deliberate falsifications constitute a violation of 10 U.S.C. Section 1001, a felony.\nIn her December 2009, response to FORM, Applicant offered more explanations\nconcerning the deliberate falsifications noted above. She acknowledged the arrests and\nconvictions and her incarceration but believed the \u201cincident regarding the fraud/identity\nwas through no fault of her own.\u201d  \nAfter considering the mitigating conditions outlined in AG \u00b6 17, I conclude that\nnone of them apply. Applicant did not make prompt or good-faith efforts to correct her\nfalsification or concealment. She provided no information that supports she was ill\nadvised in completing her SF 85P. She submitted no documentation concerning\ncounseling. She has not acknowledged her criminal behavior despite her incarceration.\nShe has provided nothing for the record to show that she has met her burden of\nmitigation for her personal conduct. \n.\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe trustworthiness concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations\nis set out in AG & 18:  \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\n\n7\nprotect \n[sensitive] \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially\noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate\nfunds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise trustworthiness concerns.\nUnder AG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially\ndisqualifying. Similarly under AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@\nmay raise security concerns. Applicant has $9,356 in delinquent debts. To date, these\ndebts remain unaddressed. The evidence is sufficient to raise these disqualifying\nconditions.\nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate\ntrustworthiness concerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG \u00b6 20(a), the\ndisqualifying conditions may be mitigated where Athe behavior happened so long ago,\nwas so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and\ndoes not cast doubt on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment.@ Most of Applicant=s debts became delinquent in 2003 and 2005. They are\nstill delinquent and have not been addressed. This mitigating condition does not apply.\nUnder AG & 20(b), it may be mitigating where Athe conditions that resulted in the\nfinancial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a\nbusiness downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation),\nand the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.@ Applicant did not\nprovide any information to support the application of this mitigating condition.\nEvidence that Athe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control@\nis potentially mitigating under AG & 20(c). Applicant did not provide any documentation\nfor the record to indicate any financial counseling. Applicant did not submit any\ndocumentation to show that she has paid any debts. Therefore, AG & 20(d), Athe\nindividual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve\ndebts,@ does not apply.\nUnder AG \u00b6 20(e), it may be mitigating when \u201cthe individual has a reasonable\nbasis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem\nand provides documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides\nevidence of actions to resolve the issue.\u201d Applicant disputed two delinquent debts in her\nresponse to FORM, but she did not produce any documentation concerning this alleged\ndispute or evidence that she is trying to resolve the delinquent debts.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a public trust position by considering the totality of the\napplicant\u2019s conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider\nthe nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n\n8\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a public\ntrust position must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant has a ten-year history of\ncriminal acts. She still does not acknowledge her past behavior. She falsified her SF\n85P in December 2006. She made false statements in subsequent interviews with\ngovernment officials. Applicant\u2019s claims that she was a victim of circumstance are not\ncredible. \nApplicant chose to rely on the written record in this administrative determination.\nIn so doing, she failed to submit sufficient information or evidence to supplement the\nrecord with relevant and material facts regarding mitigation. She has failed to meet her\nburden.\nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts with regard to\nApplicant\u2019s, eligibility for a trustworthiness position. For all these reasons, I conclude\nApplicant has not mitigated the criminal conduct, personal conduct, and financial\nconsiderations trustworthiness concerns. As noted above, AG \u00b6 2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny\ndoubt concerning personnel being considered for access to [sensitive] information will\nbe resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d  \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline J:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a:-1.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline E:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 2.a:-2.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 3, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\n\n9\nSubparagraphs 3.a:-3.t:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a public trust\nposition. Eligibility for access to sensitive information is denied.\n_____________________________\nNOREEN A LYNCH\nAdministrative Judge\n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant admitted the SOR financial allegations, except for SOR 1.b. (allegedly paid) and 1.i. (unknown to her). She admitted a February 2006 arrest for breach of trust (SOR 2.a.). She denied the falsification allegations. She is a 39-year-old receptionist employed by a defense contractor since October 2004. She will have access to sensitive medical data. The SOR alleges, and government exhibits substantiate, 11 delinquent debts totaling over $19,000. Applicant admits nine debts over $18,000. Three of the debts are medical debts totaling less than $500. She claimed, without corroboration, to have paid one debt for $165. She has not otherwise paid or arranged payment plans with any of the remaining creditors. She currently lacks the means to repay her delinquent debts. Although Applicant provides no explanation for her financial problems, her public trust application (Item 5) reflects that she was unemployed between October 2003 and October 2004. Her credit reports (Item 7, 8) show the accounts largely became delinquent between 2003 and 2006. She is also the never-married mother of two children. However, the record also reflects that Applicant made credit purchases for items (automobiles and furniture) when she knew she would be unable to make the required payments.

Jeffreys, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nMETZ, John Grattan, Jr., Administrative Judge:\nOn 27 March 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued\na Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under\nGuidelines F, J, and E.  Applicant answered the SOR 24 April 2009, and requested a\n1\ndecision without hearing. DOHA assigned the case to me 13 August 2009. The record\nin this case closed 17 August 2009, the day I overruled Department Counsel\u2019s objection\nto Applicant\u2019s response (A.E. A) to the government\u2019s File of Relevant Material (FORM). \nAugust 19, 2009\n\nShe inadvertently took home $600 in large bills in December 2005. She was afraid to turn the money in\n2\nbecause of what she thought management might think (Item 6). Nevertheless, she did not return the money\nbut used it instead to pay bills. W hen she saw how easy it was to steal from her employer she continued to\nsteal money to pay her bills, until she was detected in January 2006.\nAn application she re-certified in August 2006.\n3\n2\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant admitted the SOR financial allegations, except for SOR 1.b. (allegedly\npaid) and 1.i. (unknown to her). She admitted a February 2006 arrest for breach of trust\n(SOR 2.a.). She denied the falsification allegations. She is a 39-year-old receptionist\nemployed by a defense contractor since October 2004. She will have access to\nsensitive medical data.\nThe SOR alleges, and government exhibits substantiate, 11 delinquent debts\ntotaling over $19,000. Applicant admits nine debts over $18,000. Three of the debts are\nmedical debts totaling less than $500. She claimed, without corroboration, to have paid\none debt for $165. She has not otherwise paid or arranged payment plans with any of\nthe remaining creditors. She currently lacks the means to repay her delinquent debts.\nAlthough Applicant provides no explanation for her financial problems, her public\ntrust application (Item 5) reflects that she was unemployed between October 2003 and\nOctober 2004. Her credit reports (Item 7, 8) show the accounts largely became\ndelinquent between 2003 and 2006. She is also the never-married mother of two\nchildren. However, the record also reflects that Applicant made credit purchases for\nitems (automobiles and furniture) when she knew she would be unable to make the\nrequired payments.\nApplicant\u2019s financial problems were so severe that between December 2005 and\nJanuary 2006, she stole $2,200 cash from her employer, a major-retailer.  She had\n2\ntaken this second job in December 2004. Her employer fired her in January 2006 when\nher thefts were discovered. The formal charge in February 2006 was breach of trust, to\nwhich she pled guilty.\nWhen Applicant applied for a public trust determination in March 2006 (Item 5 ),\n3\nshe did not disclose her employment with the major-retailer between December 2004\nand January 2006, as required by question 11 (employment for the last seven years).\nShe did not disclose that she was fired from this job, as required by question 12\n(adverse employment actions for the last seven years). She did not disclose her\nFebruary 2006 arrest and conviction, as required by question 20 (arrests, charges, or\nconvictions for the last seven years). Finally, she did not disclose that she was currently\nmore than 180 days delinquent on numerous debts, as required by question 22b\n(currently over 180 days delinquent on any account).\n\n3\nApplicant gives a variety of conflicting explanations for these omissions. During a\nDecember 2007 interview with a government investigator, she claimed she omitted her\nFebruary 2006 arrest because she thought it had been expunged under the state first\noffender law. However, even if I find this claim credible, the question contains no such\nexception. She later claimed in her response to the FORM that she was told by the\npolice and her \u201ccase manager\u201d that she did not have to disclose the arrest or the other\ninformation. Beyond the lack of corroboration, it is not clear whether she means for the\nterm \u201ccase manager\u201d to refer to her criminal proceedings or her employer\u2019s guidance on\nhow to complete the application. In any event, Applicant provided no corroboration of\nany of these claims.\nDuring a January 2008 interview with a government investigator, she claimed to\nhave omitted her employment with the major retailer because she first completed an\napplication in 2004, when she had neither been employed nor fired by this employer.\nShe claimed to not recall any application after 2004. However, the application at issue in\nthis case was first executed by Applicant in March 2006, and later re-certified by her (by\nher initials) in August 2006. She offered no explanation for omitting her delinquent\ndebts. She described her financial situation as \u201cunfavorable.\u201d She professes her\nwillingness to pay her debts, but acknowledges that she lacks the means to deal with\nher delinquent debt.\nApplicant submitted no character or employment records. The case record\nreveals that few people are aware of her financial problems, her employment-related\nissues, and her criminal conviction.\nPolicies\nThe Revised Adjudicative Guidelines (RAG) list factors to be considered in\nevaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for public trust positions. Administrative judges must\nassess both disqualifying and mitigating conditions under each issue fairly raised by the\nfacts and circumstances presented. Each decision must also reflect a fair and impartial\ncommonsense consideration of the factors listed in RAG \u00b6 2(a). The presence or\nabsence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not determinative for or against\napplicant. However, specific adjudicative guidelines should be followed where a case\ncan be measured against them, as they represent policy guidance governing the grant\nor denial of access to sensitive information. Considering the SOR allegations and the\nevidence as a whole, the relevant, applicable, adjudicative guidelines are Guidelines F\n(Financial Considerations), Guideline J (Criminal Conduct), and Guideline E (Personal\nConduct).\nPublic trust determinations resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s eligibility for public trust positions.\nThe government must prove, by something less than a preponderance of the evidence,\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. If it does so, it establishes a prima facie case\nagainst access to classified information. Applicant must then refute, extenuate, or\n\nSee, Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988).\n4\n\u00b6 19.(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; (b) . . . the absence of any evidence of willingness or intent\n5\nto pay the debt or establish a realistic plan to pay the debt; (c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.\n\u00b6 20 (a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that\n6\nit is  unlikely to recur.\n\u00b6 20.(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control . . . and\n7\nthe individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.\n\u00b6 20.(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and there are clear indications\n8\nthat the problem is being resolved or is under control.\n4\nmitigate the government\u2019s case. Because no one has a right to eligibility the applicant\nbears a heavy burden of persuasion.\nPersons with access to public trust information enter into a fiduciary relationship\nwith the government based on trust and confidence. Therefore, the government has a\ncompelling interest in ensuring each Applicant possesses the requisite judgement,\nreliability, and trustworthiness of those who must protect national interests as their own.\nThe \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any\nreasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the government.4\nAnalysis\nThe government established a case for disqualification under Guideline F, and\nApplicant did not mitigate the security concerns. While some of Applicant\u2019s financial\ndifficulties are reasonably attributable to her year\u2019s unemployment between October\n2003 and October 2004, she has been both unwilling and unable to take effective action\nto address her debts despite being employed full time since October 2004, and holding\na second job between December 2004 and January 2006. However, her debts were\nalso due to her irresponsible spending when she knew she lacked the means to repay\nher creditors.  Her willingness to steal from her employer suggests she would engage in\n5\nother illegal activity to augment her income, putting sensitive information at risk.\nApplicant potentially meets only one of the mitigating factors for financial\nconsiderations. Her financial difficulties are both recent and multiple.  While her\n6\nunemployment was clearly a circumstance beyond her control, she got a new job in\nOctober 2004 and a second job in December 2004, and she has not acted responsibly\nin addressing her debts since then, having not even resolved several small debts.7\nFurther, she is unwilling or unable to live within her means. She worked a second job for\nthe major retailer for more than a year. That additional income was inadequate to\naddress her debts, as evidenced by her stealing from that employer to pay bills. In\naddition, there is no evidence that she has sought credit counseling or otherwise\nbrought the problem under control.  There is very little evidence, and no corroboration,\n8\n\n 20.(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.\n9\n\u00b6 16.(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is not sufficient for an adverse\n10\ndetermination under any other single guideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-\nperson assessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness\nto comply with rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the person may not properly\nsafeguard protected information; (d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any other\nguideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse determination, but which, when combined with all\navailable information supports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness,\nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other characteristics\nindicating that the person may not properly safeguard protected information.\n\u00b616.(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant and material facts from any personnel\n11\nsecurity questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, . . . [or]\ndetermine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness.\n5\nof any good-faith effort to satisfy her debts.  Finally, given her unwillingness to seek or\n9\nuse financial counseling, there is nothing in the record to suggest that Applicant will put\nher financial problems behind her. I conclude Guideline F against Applicant.\nThe government established a case for disqualification under Guideline E and J,\nand Applicant did not mitigate the security concerns. Applicant stole from her employer\nto address debts that she could not pay otherwise. The thefts were possible because of\nher position of trust in the company, and demonstrate both poor judgment and\nuntrustworthiness.  This was a second job for her, to augment her income from her\n10\npublic trust position. Further, her thefts from her employer go to the heart of security\nconcerns, under financial considerations as well as criminal conduct and falsifications.\nShe stole from her employer to pay bills. There is a risk she could use sensitive\ninformation to deal with her debts.\nShe later deliberately concealed her job with the major retailer, that she was fired\nfor stealing, she was convicted of stealing, and the fact that she had significant\ndelinquent debt.  She did so knowing that these issues created major public trust\n11\nconcerns for the government, and believing they might not be discovered because her\nconviction might have been expunged. She knew that to disclose any one detail about\nher employment with the major retailer (the employer, the firing, or the conviction) would\nlead to discovery of the other two details. No other interpretation reconciles all the facts.\nApplicant\u2019s convoluted explanations for her omissions are not credible.\nNone of the Guideline E mitigating conditions apply. The concealed information\nwas relevant to a clearance decision. Applicant\u2019s falsifications potentially prohibited the\ngovernment from evaluating her adverse information in a timely fashion.\nRecord evidence clearly establishes that Applicant intended to conceal her\nadverse employment history and her financial problems from the government and effect\n\n\u00b631.(a) a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses; (c) allegation or admission of criminal conduct,\n12\nregardless of whether the person was formally charged, formally prosecuted or convicted.\n6\nthe course of her background investigation. This conduct violated 18 U.S.C. \u00a71001,12\nwhether or not she was successful in effecting the course of her investigation.\nApplicant\u2019s failure to disclose her adverse employment history and financial\nproblems demonstrates a lack of candor required of public trust personnel. The\ngovernment has an interest in examining all relevant and material adverse information\nabout an Applicant before making a public trust decision. The government relies on\napplicants to truthfully disclose that adverse information in a timely fashion, not when it\nis perceived to be prudent or convenient. Further, an applicant\u2019s willingness to report\nadverse information about herself provides some indication of her willingness to report\ninadvertent violations or other concerns in the future, something the government relies\non to perform damage assessments and limit the compromise of sensitive information.\nApplicant\u2019s conduct suggests she is willing to put her personal needs ahead of\nlegitimate government interests. I resolve Guideline E and J against Applicant.\nBeyond the specific guidelines alleged by the government, the generally\napplicable disqualifying and mitigating conditions lead to the same result. Finances,\nfalsifications, and criminal conduct are core security concerns [RAG &2(a)(1)]. Her\nbehavior was deliberate and not due to circumstances beyond her control [RAG\n&2(a)(2); RAG &2(a)(5)]. Her misconduct was both recent and frequent [RAG &2(a)(3)].\nApplicant cannot attribute her conduct to youthful indiscretions. Further, honesty is a\ncore requirement for access, and not a difficult concept to understand or hold\nApplicant\u2019s to [RAG &2(a)(4).)] Rehabilitation or behavioral changes are difficult to\nmeasure under these circumstances, given the absence of corroboration of any of her\nclaims [RAG & 2(a)(6)]. She clearly sought to mislead the government about her\nemployment history and financial problems [RAG &2(a)(7)]. Applicant\u2019s willingness to\nput her personal needs ahead of legitimate government interests increases her potential\nvulnerability and she has not demonstrated that the misconduct is unlikely to recur\n[RAG & 2(a)(8); RAG & 2(a)(9)]. The concern is whether Applicant would disclose\nsituations or circumstances, whether deliberated or inadvertent, that raise security\nconcerns. Overall, the record evidence leaves substantial doubt about Applicant\u2019s\neligibility and suitability for a public trust position. Accordingly, I conclude Applicant has\nnot mitigated the trustworthiness concerns arising from her falsifications, criminal\nconduct, and financial problems.\nFormal Findings\nParagraph 1.

DeLaney, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nFOREMAN, LeRoy F., Administrative Judge: \n \nThis case involves trustworthiness concerns under Guidelines F (Financial \nConsiderations) and J (Criminal Conduct). Eligibility for assignment to a public trust \nposition is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted her application for a public trust position (SF 85P) on April 5, \n2007, and recertified it on July 6, 2007. On November 19, 2008, the Defense Office of \nHearings and Appeals (DOHA) sent her a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the \nbasis for its preliminary decision to deny her application, citing trustworthiness concerns \nunder Guidelines F and J. DOHA acted under Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, \nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive); Department of Defense (DoD) Regulation 5200.2-R, Personnel \nSecurity Program, dated Jan. 1987, as amended (Regulation); and the adjudicative \nguidelines (AG) implemented by the Department of Defense on September 1, 2006.  \n \nAugust 17, 2010\n\n \n2\n \nApplicant answered the SOR in an undated document that was received by \nDOHA on May 5, 2009, but her answer was returned to her on June 4, 2009, because it \nwas incomplete. She responded in an undated document that was received by DOHA \non July 6, 2009, and she requested a determination on the record without a hearing. \nDepartment Counsel submitted the government\u2019s written case on July 30, 2009. On the \nsame day, a complete copy of the file of relevant material (FORM) was sent to \nApplicant, who was given an opportunity to file objections and submit material to refute, \nextenuate, or mitigate the government\u2019s evidence. Applicant did not receive the FORM \nuntil May 20, 2010, but the record does not reflect the reason for the delay. She did not \nrespond to the FORM. The case was assigned to me on July 20, 2010. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn her response to the SOR, Applicant admitted the Guideline F allegations in \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.m, denied \u00b6\u00b6 1.n-1.q, admitted \u00b6 1.r, denied \u00b6 1.s, and admitted \u00b6\u00b6 1.t \nand 1.u. She admitted the Guideline J allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a and 2.b. Her \nadmissions are incorporated in my findings of fact. \n \n \nApplicant is a 29-year-old claims specialist employed by a defense contractor \nsince September 2005. She worked as a customer service representative in the private \nsector from January to October 2000, was unemployed from October 2000 to \nSeptember 2001, and then worked as a bill collector from September 2001 until she \nbegan her current job. She has never held a security clearance or a public trust position. \n \nApplicant is unmarried and has no children. The record does not reflect that she \nfinancially supports anyone other than herself.  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s credit bureau reports reflect the 21 delinquent debts alleged in the \nSOR, including the debts that she denied in her response to the SOR. (GX 9; GX 10.) \nThe delinquent debts total more than $16,700, and she has admitted debts totaling \nmore than $12,800. In response to DOHA interrogatories, she did not offer specific \nexplanations for any of the debts. Instead, she stated that she has not been able to \nresolve any of her debts because she does not earn enough money. She stated that \nshe was considering consumer credit counseling, but there is no evidence that she \nsought or obtained any counseling. (GX 8 at 2, 10.) \n \n \nApplicant filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy in October 2000. It was dismissed in \nFebruary 2001. (GX 10 at 3.) The reason for dismissal is not reflected in the record. Her \npetition for bankruptcy was not alleged in the statement of reasons. \n \n \nApplicant disclosed on her SF 85P that she was convicted of driving with a \nsuspended license in December 2003 and sentenced to one day in jail. She also \ndisclosed that she was convicted of prostitution in January 2005 and placed on \nprobation for two years. (GX 7 at 7.) \n \n\n \n3\nPolicies \n \nPositions designated as ADP I and ADP II are classified as \u201csensitive positions.\u201d \nRegulation \u00b6\u00b6 C3.1.2.1.1.7 and C3.1.2.1.2.3. The standard that must be met for \nassignment to sensitive duties is that the person\u2019s loyalty, reliability, and trustworthiness \nare such that assigning the person to sensitive duties is \u201cclearly consistent with the \ninterests of national security.\u201d Regulation \u00b6 C6.1.1.1. Department of Defense contractor \npersonnel are entitled to the procedural protections in the Directive before any final \nunfavorable access determination may be made. Regulation \u00b6 C8.2.1.  \n \nA person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. \nDecisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the applicant may \ndeliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard sensitive information.  \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a public trust position, the \nadministrative judge must consider the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the AG. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of \nhuman behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction an evaluation of the whole \nperson. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \n[sensitive] information will be resolved in favor of national security. The Government \nmust present substantial evidence to establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14. Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by \nsubstantial evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate the facts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla \nbut less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d \n375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). An applicant has the ultimate burden of \ndemonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant \nor him or her eligibility for assignment to a sensitive position.  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \n \nThe trustworthiness concern under this guideline is set out in AG & 18:   \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \n\n \n4\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \n[sensitive] \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s financial history raises the disqualifying conditions in AG & 19(a) \n(inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts) and AG & 19(c) (a history of not meeting \nfinancial obligations). Thus, she has the burden to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate \nthe facts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  \n \nTrustworthiness concerns under this guideline may be mitigated if \u201cthe behavior \nhappened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it \nis unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual=s current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment.@ AG \u00b6 20(a). This mitigating condition is not \nestablished, because Applicant\u2019s debts are numerous, not yet resolved, and there is no \nevidence that they occurred under circumstances making them unlikely to recur. \n \nTrustworthiness concerns also may be mitigated if Athe conditions that resulted in \nthe financial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of \nemployment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce \nor separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.@ AG & \n20(b). Applicant was unemployed from October 2000 to September 2001, but she has \nbeen employed continuously since September 2001. She is financially responsible only \nfor herself. The record reflects that she filed a petition for Chapter 13 bankruptcy when \nshe became unemployed, but it was dismissed in February 2001, before completion. \nShe submitted no evidence of efforts to resolve, compromise, or settle her debts. This \nmitigating condition is not established. \n \nTrustworthiness concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing \nthat \u201cthe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are \nclear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control.\u201d AG \u00b6 20(c). This \nmitigating condition is not established because Applicant has not sought or received \nfinancial counseling and her financial problems are not under control. \n \n \nTrustworthiness concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing \nthat \u201cthe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise \nresolve debts.\u201d AG \u00b6 20(d). Good faith means acting in a way that shows \nreasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation. ISCR Case \nNo. 99-0201, 1999 WL 1442346 at *4 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 1999). This mitigating condition \nis not established because Applicant submitted no evidence of efforts to repay or \nresolve her debts. \n \n \nTrustworthiness concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing \n\u201cthe individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-due debt \nwhich is the cause of the problem and provides documented proof to substantiate the \n\n \n5\nbasis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions to resolve the issue.\u201d AG \u00b6 20(e). \nThis mitigating condition is not established because Applicant has not disputed any of \nthe debts. \n \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct \n \nThe trustworthiness concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 30 as follows: \n\u201cCriminal conduct creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person's ability or willingness \nto comply with laws, rules and regulations.\u201d  \n \nConditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include \n\u201ca single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses\u201d and \u201callegation or admission of \ncriminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was formally charged, formally \nprosecuted, or convicted.\u201d AG \u00b6\u00b6 31(a) and (c). Applicant\u2019s disclosure of criminal \nconduct on her SF 85P and her admissions in her response to the SOR establish these \ntwo disqualifying conditions.   \n \n \nTrustworthiness concerns under this guideline may be mitigated by evidence that \n\u201cso much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it happened under \nsuch unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d AG \u00b6 32(a). The first prong of \nthis mitigating condition (\u201cso much time has elapsed\u201d) focuses on whether the criminal \nconduct was recent. There are no Abright line@ rules for determining when conduct is \nArecent.@ The determination must be based on a careful evaluation of the totality of the \nevidence. See ISCR Case No. 02-24452 at 6 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2004). If the evidence \nshows Aa significant period of time has passed without any evidence of misconduct,@ \nthen an administrative judge must determine whether that period of time demonstrates \nAchanged circumstances or conduct sufficient to warrant a finding of reform or \nrehabilitation.@ Id.  \n \n \nApplicant has provided no information regarding the circumstances of her two \ncriminal convictions. Her conviction for prostitution occurred while she was gainfully \nemployed and only eight months before she began her current position. It reinforces the \nGuideline F concern that she might engage in illegal conduct to generate additional \nincome. She was on probation until early 2007. She submitted her SF 85P in April 2007 \nand has been trying since then to obtain a favorable trustworthiness determination. She \nhas not demonstrated that she can be trusted to refrain from illegal conduct once the \npressure of qualifying for a position of trust is lifted. I conclude that AG \u00b6 32(a) is not \nestablished. \n \nFinally, trustworthiness concerns may be mitigated if \u201cthere is evidence of \nsuccessful rehabilitation; including but not limited to the passage of time without \nrecurrence of criminal activity, remorse or restitution, job training or higher education, \ngood employment record, or constructive community involvement.\u201d AG \u00b6 32(d). \nApplicant provided no evidence from supervisors, neighbors, friends, or coworkers \n\n \n6\nabout the quality of her performance or constructive community involvement. For this \nreason, as well as the reasons set out in the above discussion of AG \u00b6 32(a), I conclude \nthat she has not provided sufficient evidence of successful rehabilitation. No other \nenumerated mitigating conditions under this guideline have been established. \n \nWhole-Person Analysis \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a public trust position by considering the totality of the \napplicant\u2019s conduct and all the relevant circumstances. An administrative judge should \nconsider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for an \nassignment to a public trust position must be an overall commonsense judgment based \nupon careful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have \nincorporated my comments under Guidelines F and J in my whole-person analysis.  \n \n \nApplicant did not request a hearing, limiting my ability to assess her sincerity, \ncredibility, candor, and remorse. She provided little information about the circumstances \nof her financial difficulties and criminal conduct.  \n \n \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guidelines F and \nJ, and evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude \nApplicant has not mitigated the trustworthiness concerns based on financial \nconsiderations and criminal conduct. Accordingly, I conclude she has not carried her \nburden of showing that it is clearly consistent with the interests of national security to \ngrant her eligibility for assignment to a public trust position.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): AGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.u: \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n\n \n7\n \nParagraph 2, Guideline J (Criminal Conduct):  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.b: \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a \npublic trust position.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nJonathan M. Andes, Esq., Personal Representative\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) proposed to deny or revoke access to\nautomated information systems in ADP-I/II/III sensitivity positions for Applicant.  On February 27,\n2009, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for that\ndecision\u2014trustworthiness concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant\nrequested a hearing.  On August 24, 2009, after the hearing, Administrative Judge Robert J. Tuider\ndenied Applicant\u2019s request for a trustworthiness designation.  Applicant  appealed pursuant to the\nDirective \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\n\n\u201c[T]he individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.\u201d\n1\nIt is not made clear in Applicant\u2019s brief whether the \u201cdischarge\u201d of the mortgage debt was a part of the\n2\nbankruptcy proceedings. \n \nHearing Transcript at p. 32.\n3\nApplicant raises the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge erroneously failed to apply\nmitigating condition  \u00b6 20(d)  in Applicant\u2019s favor.  For the following reasons, the Board affirms the\n1\nJudge\u2019s adverse trustworthiness determination. \nLarge portions of Applicant\u2019s appeal brief discuss matters that were not part of the record\nbelow.  The main thrust of Applicant\u2019s argument is that the Judge relied on outdated credit reports\nand did not take into consideration the fact that an outstanding, delinquent mortgage debt of\n$314,753 was discharged during early 2009, prior to the hearing, and that other debts in the amount\nof $39,753 have since been discharged in bankruptcy.  Included in Applicant\u2019s appeal is a more\nrecent credit report, prepared after the hearing, which indicates that Applicant\u2019s debt has been greatly\nreduced.  \nApplicant\u2019s brief introduces new evidence, which the Board cannot consider on appeal.\nDirective, \u00b6 E3.1.29.  Moreover, the Judge cannot reasonably be expected to consider facts and\ncircumstances that were not presented to him and made part of the record.  There is no record\nevidence of a discharge in bankruptcy for Applicant.  Likewise there is no record evidence of any\n\u201cdischarge\u201d of the delinquent mortgage debt.   Applicant represents that the resolution of the\n2\nmortgage debt took place prior to the hearing.  However, there is no mention of this in the record;\nand when discussing the mortgage debt during the hearing, Applicant indicated only that her house\nhad been foreclosed upon and that she saw a \u201cfor sale\u201d sign on the property when she drove by one\nday.   Had additional or updated facts been available at the time of the hearing, it was up to\n3\nApplicant to get those facts into the record.  The Judge is under no obligation to obtain evidence to\nupdate the record.  Applicant has failed to establish error.\n\nOrder\nThe Judge\u2019s unfavorable trustworthiness determination is AFFIRMED.\nSigned: Jeffrey D. Billett         \n Jeffrey D.

On February 27, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) \nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the trustworthiness concerns under \nGuideline F (Financial Considerations) for Applicant.  \n \nThe action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1990), as amended; Department of Defense \nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); Department of Defense (DoD) Regulation \n5200.2-R, Personnel Security Program, dated January 1987, as amended (Regulation), \nand the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on \nDecember 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued \nafter September 1, 2006.  \n1 \n \nAugust 24, 2009\n\n2 \n \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on March 6, 2009. She answered the \nSOR in writing on March 17, 2009, and requested a hearing before an administrative \njudge. DOHA received the request on March 23, 2009. Department Counsel was \nprepared to proceed on May 18, 2009, and I received the case assignment on May 21, \n2009.  \n \nDOHA issued a notice of hearing on May 29 2009, scheduling the case for June \n9, 2009. The hearing was held as scheduled. The government offered Government \nExhibits (GE) 1 through 4, which were received without objection.

GE 1 \u2013 4. \n \nThe government alleged in the SOR and established by Applicant\u2019s admissions \nand or evidence presented that she has seven delinquent debts totaling $314,753. The \ndebts consist of five charged off accounts, one judgment, and one foreclosure \nproceeding. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. \u2013 1.g.)  \n \nApplicant attributes her financial difficulties to several factors to include being out \nof work for \u201cabout a month\u201d after an injury, her husband\u2019s cumulative two and one-half \nyears of unemployment beginning in 2005, and the unscrupulous practices of a lender. \nTr. 12, 18-20, 25. Shortfalls in income led to Applicant getting behind on her bills, and \nusing credit cards to pay living expenses. Ultimately, her lender foreclosed on their \nhome. Applicant and her husband used the services of a debt consolidation company \nuntil her husband lost one of his jobs. Applicant and her husband attempted to work with \ntheir mortgage company, but \u201cthey weren\u2019t willing to work with us.\u201d Tr. 21-24. \n \n\n3 \n \nApplicant and her family are now renting a house for $1,000 per month. She \ndrives a late model minivan with high mileage in need of repair, Tr. 21, 24. Applicant \nestimates, based on her current combined salary with her husband after monthly \nexpenses, she has net remainder of \u201c[m]aybe $100.\u201d At her hearing, she stated she had \n\u201c[p]robably $100\u201d in her savings account and typically had a checking account balance \nof \u201c[p]retty close to none.\u201d She described her situation as, \u201c[w]e really live paycheck to \npaycheck trying to do better.\u201d Tr. 29-32.  \n \nApplicant and his wife are unable to pay the debts alleged. They consulted with a \nbankruptcy attorney and on February 9, 2008, signed a retainer agreement for him to \nrepresent them in a chapter 7 proceeding. The agreement requires them to pay their \nattorney $2,050 plus a $299 filing fee before he will initiate bankruptcy proceedings. GE \n2. As of the hearing date, they had only paid their bankruptcy attorney $400 towards his \nfee. Tr. 36-37. Applicant\u2019s financial recovery plan is to file chapter 7 bankruptcy as soon \nas she and her husband are able to pay the remainder their bankruptcy attorney\u2019s \nrequired fee. Their ability to pay the balance of attorney fees has recently been \nhampered by expensive automobile repair bills for her husband\u2019s late model sedan after \nthe \u201cmotor blew up.\u201d Tr. 38. \n \nApplicant summarized her position as, \u201cWe\u2019re trying to do the best we can and, \nprovide for our daughter and keep a roof over our head.\u201d Tr. 46. As of her hearing date, \nher financial recovery plan was to pay her bankruptcy attorney his fee when able, and \nfile chapter 7 bankruptcy. Tr. 48-49.  \n \nApplicant submitted 16 reference letters. Collectively, these letters convey a \npowerful message that Applicant is hard working, honorable, trustworthy, wonderful \nwife, mother and friend, and a most caring and giving person. The authors of these \nletters included childhood friends, co-workers, relatives, members of her religious \norganization, and her personal representative. AE A \u2013 AE P. This characterization was \nconsistent with how she presented herself at her hearing. \n \nPolicies \n \nPositions designated as ADP I and ADP II are classified as \u201csensitive positions.\u201d  \n(See Regulation \u00b6\u00b6 C3.1.2.1.1.7 and C3.1.2.1.2.3.)  \u201cThe standard that must be met for \n. . . assignment to sensitive duties is that, based on all available information, the \nperson\u2019s loyalty, reliability, and trustworthiness are such that . . . assigning the person to \nsensitive duties is clearly consistent with the interests of national security.\u201d (See \nRegulation \u00b6 C6.1.1.1.) The Deputy Under Secretary of Defense (Counterintelligence \nand Security) Memorandum, dated November 19, 2004, indicates trustworthiness \nadjudications will apply to cases forwarded to DOHA by the Defense Security Service \nand Office of Personnel Management.  Department of Defense contractor personnel are \nafforded the right to the procedures contained in the Directive before any final \nunfavorable access determination may be made. (See Regulation \u00b6 C8.2.1.)   \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a public trust position, the \nadministrative judge must consider the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the AG. \n\n4 \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of \nhuman behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the \nadjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, \nimpartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a \nconscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d \nThe administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the \nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \n[sensitive] information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable \ntrustworthiness decision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nsensitive information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard sensitive \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of sensitive information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order (EO) 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin \nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty \nof the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe trustworthiness concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations \nis set out in AG & 18:   \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \n\n5 \n \nprotect \n[sensitive] \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nThe Guideline notes several conditions that could raise trustworthiness concerns.  \nUnder AG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially \ndisqualifying. Similarly under AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ \nmay raise security concerns. Applicant accumulated seven delinquent accounts, totaling \n$314,753 as noted supra. Her indebtedness began as early as 2005 and has been \nongoing. The evidence is sufficient to raise these potentially disqualifying conditions, \nrequiring a closer examination. \n \nThe Guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate \ntrustworthiness concerns arising from financial difficulties. Applicant experienced an \ninjury causing her to miss work for a brief period, but more significantly her husband \nwas unemployed cumulatively for two and one-half years beginning in 2005. This loss of \nincome lead to significant financial problems that have been ongoing. Two potential \nmitigating conditions apply under this concern. \n \nUnder AG & 20(b), it may be mitigating where Athe conditions that resulted in the \nfinancial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a \nbusiness downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), \nand the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.@ As noted, Applicant was \nout of work for a brief period due to an injury, and her husband was unemployed for \nsignificant periods of time. With the loss of income, Applicant and her husband lost their \nhome to foreclosure and accumulated other debts as noted in the SOR. \n \nI note that Applicant\u2019s financial problems are not recent and have been ongoing \nfor several years. The record is clear that Applicant and her husband experienced some \nconditions beyond their control as discussed supra, which lead to their current dilemma, \nand attempted to work with their creditors. For this reason, I am able to apply partial \ncredit under mitigating condition AG \u00b6 20(b). \n \nAG & 20(d) applies where the evidence shows Athe individual initiated a good-\nfaith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.@ Unfortunately, \nApplicant has been unable to initiate a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors. Her \ncurrent strategy is to declare chapter 7 bankruptcy, but cannot do so until she pays her \nbankruptcy attorney fees. As of her hearing, she had paid $400 towards a $2,050 \nattorney fee and $299 filing fee. Since she executed her retainer agreement with her \nattorney, she has a remaining balance of at least $1,949 and remains in arrears with \ndebts totaling at least $314,753. Moreover, Applicant has no definitive ongoing plans \nthat will allow her to move forward with bankruptcy, which will allow her to obtain a fresh \nstart and establish a track record of financial responsibility. Given the significant amount \nof unresolved debt leveraged in favor of Applicant, I am unable to apply mitigating \ncondition AG \u00b6 20(d). \n \n \n\n6 \n \n                                                          \nThe \nobjective \nof \na \ntrustworthiness \ndetermination \nis \nthe \nfair-minded, \ncommonsense assessment of a person\u2019s trustworthiness and fitness for access to \nsensitive information. Indeed, the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept recognizes we should view a \nperson by the totality of his acts and omissions. Each case must be adjudged on its own \nmerits, taking into consideration all relevant circumstances, and applying sound \njudgment, mature thinking, and careful analysis. \n \nConsidering all relevant and material facts and circumstances present in this \ncase, the whole person concept, the factors listed in \u00b6 6.3.1 through \u00b6 6.3.6 of the \nDirective, and the applicable disqualifying and mitigating conditions, I find Applicant has \nnot mitigated the financial considerations concern. She has not overcome the case \nagainst her and satisfied her ultimate burden of persuasion.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a public trust position. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has not mitigated the trustworthiness concerns arising from her \nfinancial considerations.  \n \nIn fairness to the Applicant, this decision should not be construed as a \ndetermination that she cannot or will not attain the state of financial stability necessary \nto justify the holding of a public trust position. To the contrary, her mitigating evidence \nand whole person analysis suggests a sound potential for positive reform and \noutstanding accomplishments in the defense industry. Were it merely a matter of \nfavorable character evidence alone, Applicant would prevail. Given the amount of \nApplicant\u2019s indebtedness, greater progress is required in her debt resolution. Should \nApplicant be afforded an opportunity to reapply for a public trust position in the future, \nshe may well demonstrate persuasive evidence warranting a favorable result. \n \n  \nI take this position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518 (1988), my \u201ccareful consideration of the whole person factors\u201d1 and \nsupporting evidence, my application of the pertinent factors under the adjudicative \nprocess, and my interpretation of my responsibilities under the Guidelines. Applicant \nhas not mitigated or overcome the government\u2019s case. For the reasons stated, I \nconclude she is not eligible for access to a public trust position. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a. \u2013 1.g.:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n1 See ISCR Case No. 04-06242 at 2 (App. Bd.

Applicant  appealed pursuant to the\nDirective \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\n\n\u201c[T]he individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.\u201d\n1\nIt is not made clear in Applicant\u2019s brief whether the \u201cdischarge\u201d of the mortgage debt was a part of the\n2\nbankruptcy proceedings. \n \nHearing Transcript at p. 32.\n3\n2\nApplicant raises the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge erroneously failed to apply\nmitigating condition  \u00b6 20(d)  in Applicant\u2019s favor.  For the following reasons, the Board affirms the\n1\nJudge\u2019s adverse trustworthiness determination. \nLarge portions of Applicant\u2019s appeal brief discuss matters that were not part of the record\nbelow.  The main thrust of Applicant\u2019s argument is that the Judge relied on outdated credit reports\nand did not take into consideration the fact that an outstanding, delinquent mortgage debt of\n$314,753 was discharged during early 2009, prior to the hearing, and that other debts in the amount\nof $39,753 have since been discharged in bankruptcy.  Included in Applicant\u2019s appeal is a more\nrecent credit report, prepared after the hearing, which indicates that Applicant\u2019s debt has been greatly\nreduced.  \nApplicant\u2019s brief introduces new evidence, which the Board cannot consider on appeal.\nDirective, \u00b6 E3.1.29.  Moreover, the Judge cannot reasonably be expected to consider facts and\ncircumstances that were not presented to him and made part of the record.  There is no record\nevidence of a discharge in bankruptcy for Applicant.  Likewise there is no record evidence of any\n\u201cdischarge\u201d of the delinquent mortgage debt.   Applicant represents that the resolution of the\n2\nmortgage debt took place prior to the hearing.  However, there is no mention of this in the record;\nand when discussing the mortgage debt during the hearing, Applicant indicated only that her house\nhad been foreclosed upon and that she saw a \u201cfor sale\u201d sign on the property when she drove by one\nday.   Had additional or updated facts been available at the time of the hearing, it was up to\n3\nApplicant to get those facts into the record.  The Judge is under no obligation to obtain evidence to\nupdate the record.  Applicant has failed to establish error.\n\n3\nOrder\nThe Judge\u2019s unfavorable trustworthiness determination is AFFIRMED.\nSigned: Jeffrey D. Billett         \n Jeffrey D.

Coacher, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\n \nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On October 29, 2008, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant\nof the basis for that decision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline J (Criminal Conduct) and\n\n2\nGuideline E (Personal Conduct) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992), as\namended (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.  On June 23, 2009, after the hearing,\nAdministrative Judge Charles D. Ablard granted Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.\nDepartment Counsel appealed pursuant to the Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nDepartment Counsel raises the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s conclusions\nunder Guidelines J and E are arbitrary and capricious because they are unsupported by the record \nevidence; and whether the Judge\u2019s whole-person analysis is unsustainable because it is contrary to\nand unsupported by the totality of the record evidence.  Finding error, we reverse the Judge\u2019s\ndecision.\nWhether the Record Supports the Judge\u2019s Factual Findings\nA.  Facts\nThe Judge made the following relevant factual findings: Applicant is 39 years old and has\na master\u2019s degree in mathematics.  In July 2006, Applicant was arrested and charged with theft after\nhe left a bookstore carrying three shopping bags of books without paying for them.  Applicant\npleaded no contest, and the court deferred adjudication.  In a security investigation in 2007,\nApplicant admitted to an investigator that he had stolen books from the same chain of bookstores\napproximately ten times between February and June 2006 without being caught.  Applicant told the\ninvestigator that he doubted that \u201che would ever have the nerve to tell [the bookstore] about the other\nstolen books.\u201d  Decision at 3.  At the time of the hearing, Applicant had told his wife, his parents,\nand his employer about the thefts.  However, he had not told his children.  After the hearing,\nApplicant told his two older children and the management of the bookstore about his behavior and\nsubmitted evidence to that effect.  Applicant\u2019s employer knows of his thefts and still praises him and\nrecommends reinstatement of his security clearance.\nB.  Discussion \n \nThe Appeal Board\u2019s review of the Judge\u2019s findings of facts is limited to determining if they\nare supported by substantial evidence\u2013\u201csuch relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept\nas adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the same record.\u201d\nDirective  \u00b6 E3.1.32.1.  \u201cThis is something less than the weight of the evidence, and the possibility\nof drawing two inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent an administrative\nagency\u2019s finding from being supported by substantial evidence.\u201d  Consolo v.

Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1.\nDepartment Counsel has not challenged the above factual findings.  Therefore, they are not\nat issue on appeal.  Department Counsel\u2019s appeal concerns the Judge\u2019s conclusions, which will be\ndiscussed below.\nWhether the Record Supports the Judge\u2019s Ultimate Conclusions\n\n\u201c[S]o much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it happened under such unusual\n1\ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment;\u201d . . . and \u201cthere is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited to the passage of time without\nrecurrence of criminal activity, remorse or restitution, job training or higher education, or constructive community\ninvolvement[.]\u201d  Directive \u00b6 E2.32(a) and (d).\n \n3\n A Judge is required to \u201cexamine the relevant data and articulate a satisfactory explanation\nfor\u201d the decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.\u2019\u201d\nMotor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n of the United States v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43\n(1983)(quoting Burlington Truck Lines, Inc. v. United States, 371 U.S. 156, 168 (1962)).  \u201cThe\ngeneral standard is that a clearance may be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests\nof the national security.\u2019\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  The Appeal\nBoard may reverse the Judge\u2019s decision to grant, deny, or revoke a security clearance if it is arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.  Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.32.3 and E3.1.33.3.  \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility, there is a strong\npresumption against the grant or maintenance of a security clearance.  See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913\nF. 2d 1399, 1401 (9  Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991).  After the Government presents\nth\nevidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or\nmitigate those concerns.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  \u201cThe application of disqualifying and mitigating\nconditions and whole person factors does not turn simply on a finding that one or more of them apply\nto the particular facts of a case.  Rather, their application requires the exercise of sound discretion\nin light of the record evidence as a whole.\u201d  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 05-03635 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec.\n20, 2006).\nIn deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are arbitrary or capricious, the Board\nwill review the Judge's decision to determine whether:  it does not examine relevant evidence; it fails\nto articulate a satisfactory explanation for its conclusions, including a rational connection between\nthe facts found and the choice made; it does not consider relevant factors; it reflects a clear error of\njudgment; it fails to consider an important aspect of the case; it offers an explanation for the decision\nthat runs contrary to the record evidence; or it is so implausible that it cannot be ascribed to a mere\ndifference of opinion.  In deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are contrary to law,\nthe Board will consider whether they are contrary to provisions of Executive Order 10865, the\nDirective, or other applicable federal law.  See ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Jun. 2,\n2006).\nDepartment Counsel contends that the Judge\u2019s conclusions under Guidelines J and E are\narbitrary and capricious because they are unsupported by the record evidence.  Department Counsel\u2019s\ncontention has merit.  The Judge found significant security concerns under Guidelines J and E, but\nfound Applicant\u2019s conduct to be mitigated under both Guidelines.\nUnder Guideline J, the Judge applied Criminal Conduct Mitigating Conditions (CCMC) (a)\nand (d).   The Judge himself stated that Applicant\u2019s thefts were \u201csomewhat recent\u201d and that, because\n1\n\nAs noted above, Applicant told an investigator that he did not think he could ever bring himself to inform the\n2\ncompany about the earlier thefts.  Prior to the hearing, Applicant wrote to the company three times\u2014to ask for leniency,\nto request that the Order of Trespass preventing him from entering the store be lifted, and to request formal\ndocumentation that the Order of Trespass had been lifted.  However, he did not mention the other thefts in those letters.\nAt the hearing, Applicant stated that he feared further criminal proceedings.  Decision at 3.  Applicant testified that he\nhad intended to inform the company of the earlier thefts after three years had passed.  Transcript at 39.  After being\nquestioned on the issue at the hearing, Applicant wrote to the company immediately after the hearing and submitted a\ncopy of the letter as evidence.    \n\u201c[T]he offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is so infrequent, or it happened under\n3\nsuch unique circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability,\ntrustworthiness, or good judgment;\u201d\n\u201cthe individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling to change the behavior or taken other\npositive steps to alleviate the stressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, or other\ninappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur;\u201d\nand \u201cthe individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation,\nor duress[.]\u201d Directive \u00b6 E2.17(c), (d), and (e). \n4\nthe thefts occurred on about 12 occasions, \u201cthey are not \u2018isolated.\u2019\u201d  Decision at 6.  However, the\nJudge found that \u201cthe thefts do not continue to cast doubt on Applicant\u2019s current reliability,\ntrustworthiness and good judgment because he has been rehabilitated.\u201d  Id.  To reach his conclusion\nof mitigation, the Judge engaged in a piecemeal analysis of the record.  In his analysis, the Judge\nminimized Applicant\u2019s behavior and failed to consider the totality of that behavior and its security\nimplications.  Such analysis constitutes error.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 04-12648 at 3-4 (App. Bd.\nOct. 20, 2006).  The record evidence does not support the Judge\u2019s findings of rehabilitation,\nespecially in light of the nature and seriousness of Applicant\u2019s conduct and the fact that Applicant\nhimself cannot explain why the conduct occurred.  Applicant\u2019s thefts occurred only three years\nbefore the hearing.  There were ten to twelve thefts over a five-month period, and Applicant\u2019s\nbehavior involved poor judgment, lack of reliability, untrustworthiness, and risk-taking which could\nhave serious security implications.  The Board has held that \u201c[t]he more serious or long-term an\napplicant\u2019s conduct is, the stronger the evidence of rehabilitation needs to be for the Judge to find\nthe applicant has overcome the negative security implications of that conduct.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 94-\n0964 at 6 (App. Bd. Jul. 3, 1996).  Moreover, Applicant did not admit to the bookstore management\nthe thefts other than the one for which he was caught until after the hearing.   Considering the record\n2\nas a whole, the Judge\u2019s reliance on CCMC (a) and (d) is not sustainable. \nUnder Guideline E, the Judge applied Personal Conduct Mitigating Conditions (PCMC) (c),\n(d), and (e).   Here also, the Judge stated that Applicant\u2019s thefts are \u201cvery unlikely to recur\u201d and do\n3\nnot cast doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment, and therefore the Judge found\nmitigation under Guideline E.  Decision at 8-9.  The record as a whole does not support the Judge\u2019s\napplication of PCMC (c), (d), and (e).  For the reasons that follow, the Judge\u2019s conclusions that\nApplicant\u2019s thefts are very unlikely to recur and do not cast doubt on Applicant\u2019s reliability,\ntrustworthiness, or good judgment, are not sustainable.\n\n5\nThe Judge\u2019s application of mitigation is also related to his finding that Applicant \u201chas done\neverything the he reasonably can do to establish his rehabilitation.\u201d  The record contains evidence\nfrom which the Judge could find that Applicant reduced his vulnerability to duress, but the\nconclusion about Applicant\u2019s rehabilitation is also based, significantly, on the finding that the\ncircumstances were \u201cunique\u201d and are \u201cvery unlikely to recur.\u201d Decision at 8-9.  In this regard, the\nJudge does not articulate any reasonable explanation as to why the circumstances in which Applicant\nfound himself were unique, how they prompted Applicant to engage in the conduct involved, and\nwhy such circumstances are very unlikely to recur.  As described above, Applicant himself cannot\nexplain why he engaged in this conduct.  Viewed objectively, the conduct reflects an unexplained,\nrecent and recurrent pattern of questionable judgment, risk-taking, lack of reliability and\ntrustworthiness, and irresponsibility.  The passage of a significant amount of time without\nrecurrence, does not exist here; and no other evidence in the record plausibly tends to provide proof\nof rehabilitation.\nDepartment Counsel also contends that the Judge\u2019s whole-person analysis is unsustainable\nbecause it is contrary to and unsupported by the record evidence.  Department Counsel\u2019s contention\nhas merit.  A whole-person analysis is intended to be a commonsense evaluation of an applicant\u2019s\nconduct and circumstances as a whole.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 05-07983 at 6 (App. Bd. Oct. 1,\n2007).  Here, the Judge reviewed the evidence in a piecemeal manner, looking at individual acts and\ncircumstances, rather than the totality of Applicant\u2019s situation.  As explained in the preceding\nparagraph, the conduct reflects an unexplained, recent and recurring pattern of questionable\njudgment, risk-taking, lack of reliability and trustworthiness, and irresponsibility.  Directive \u00b6\nE2.2(d).  The record evidence does not support the Judge\u2019s decision.\nOrder\nThe Judge\u2019s decision granting Applicant a security clearance is REVERSED.\nSigned: Michael D.

After he was arrested in July 2006, he fully disclosed his conduct, received \ncounseling, paid restitution, successfully completed his probation, and did everything \nreasonable to establish his rehabilitation. Applicant mitigated security concerns arising \nfrom personal conduct and criminal conduct. Eligibility for access to classified \ninformation is granted. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn August 16, 2006, Applicant completed a security clearance application \n(EPSQ version) (Government Exhibit (GE) 1). On October 29, 2008, the Defense Office \nof Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to him, \npursuant to Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within \nIndustry, dated February 20, 1960, as amended and modified, and Department of \nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended and modified. The revised \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, are \neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \nJune 23, 2009\n\n \n        2 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                        \n                                           \n \nThe SOR alleges security concerns under Guidelines J (Criminal Conduct) and E \n(Personal Conduct). The SOR detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the \npreliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue a security clearance for him, and recommended \nreferral to an administrative judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, \ncontinued, denied, or revoked. \n \nOn November 20, 2008, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations, and \nrequested a hearing before an administrative judge (GE 8). Department Counsel was \nprepared to proceed on March 25, 2009. On April 3, 2009, the case was assigned to \nme. On April 7, 2009, DOHA issued a hearing notice (GE 6). The hearing was held on \nApril 20, 2009. At the hearing, Applicant affirmatively waived the 15-day notice \nrequirement in the Directive (Transcript (Tr. 8-9)). Department Counsel offered five \nexhibits (GE 1-5) (Transcript (Tr.) 13-14), and Applicant offered 14 exhibits (Tr. 16-22; \nApplicant Exhibits (AE) A-M2). There were no objections, and I admitted GE 1-5 (Tr. 14) \nand AE A-M2 (Tr. 23). Additionally, I admitted the Notice of Hearing, SOR, and \nresponse to the SOR (GE 6-8). On April 27, 2009, I received three exhibits from \nApplicant. I received the transcript on April 28, 2009. Department Counsel did not object \nto my consideration of these three exhibits and I admitted them into evidence (AE N-P).     \n   \nFindings of Fact1 \n \nIn his SOR response, Applicant admitted all of the SOR allegations (GE 8). His \nadmissions are accepted as findings of fact.  \n \n \nApplicant is 39 years old and has worked for a government contractor as an \nengineer since 1997 (Tr. 30, 37). Applicant married in 1993 and his three children are \nages 10, six and 18 months (Tr. 35; GE 1). He and his son enjoy scouting activities (Tr. \n36). Applicant said he never cheated in school, always pays his bills, and led an \nhonorable life (Tr. 31). Applicant has a bachelor\u2019s degree in behavioral science with a \ndouble major in math and English (Tr. 32-33). He has a master\u2019s degree in mathematics \n(Tr. 33). He received excellent grades in college and in his master\u2019s degree program \n(AE J, K). Applicant is certified to teach and did teach secondary-level mathematics and \nEnglish for 18 months (Tr. 33-34). His security clearance was suspended on July 20, \n2006 (Tr. 39). \n \nCriminal conduct and personal conduct  \n \nOn July 19, 2006, Applicant was arrested and charged with theft over $50 but \nless than $500 for shoplifting from a bookstore (GE 5). He was released on bail the \nevening of his arrest (GE 2). This is a Class B Misdemeanor (GE 5). He was caught \ncarrying three shopping bags full of books (about 20 books) out of the store (Tr. 40; GE \n2). When he was caught, it was the largest amount of books he had ever stolen or \n \n1Some details have not been included in order to protect Applicant\u2019s right to privacy. Specific \ninformation is available in the cited exhibits. \n\n \n        3 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                        \nattempted to steal from a store (Tr. 40). On one previous occasion, he took a grocery \nsack full of books from a store; however, on that occasion he was not caught (Tr. 42). \nHe pleaded nolo contendere or no contest, and the court deferred adjudication (GE 5). \nHe was fined $500 plus court costs, required to pay fees of $75, and placed on \ncommunity supervision for nine months starting September 5, 2006 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 2.a; \nTr. 31; GE 5, 9). The community supervision also involved payment of a monthly fee \n(GE 5). He completed about 20 hours of community service (GE 2). \n \nOn August 18, 2006, Applicant described his arrest and admitted the theft on his \nsecurity clearance application (GE 1). He also apologized and noted his expectation \nthat he would be sentenced on September 5, 2006 (GE 1). \n \nIn March 2007, an Office of Personnel Management (OPM) investigator \ninterviewed Applicant (Tr. 24; GE 2). Applicant admitted that he stole books from three \nbook stores from the same chain of book stores on approximately 10 different occasions \nfrom February 2006 to June 2006 without getting caught (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 2.a; Tr. 27; GE \n9). Applicant sometimes took as much as a shopping bag full of books on one occasion \n(Tr. 27). On other occasions he may have taken a single book valued at $2-$3 (GE 2). \nHe told the OPM investigator that he doubted that \u201che would ever have the nerve to tell \n[the bookstore] about the other stolen books.\u201d (Tr. 26; GE 2 at 5). At the time of the \nhearing, he had not told his children about the theft (Tr. 27). In July 2006 after he was \ncaught, he told his wife about the thefts (Tr. 28). He also talked to his parents about it \n(Tr. 29). The day after he was arrested for theft, he reported the arrest to his security \nofficer and his manager (Tr. 39; AE D).  \n \nAs part of his probation, Applicant attended an anti-theft class, which was a four-\nhour course (Tr. 28). The class was not required by the court but he attended it because \nhis attorney advised him he should complete a course of this nature (Tr. 28). Applicant \nsent a letter to each of the three bookstores (Tr. 25; AE A-C). However, at the time of \nhis hearing, he had not revealed the full scope of his thefts because he was worried \nabout potential criminal proceedings (Tr. 30, 32). In the summer of 2008, he sent the \nbookstore chain a $250 donation (Tr. 25).  \n \nOver the last three years he has thought about the thefts and he could not \nexplain why he committed the thefts (Tr. 29). In 2006, his annual income was about \n$68,000 and his current income is $70,000 (Tr. 34-35). He was not under any financial \nstrain when he committed the thefts (Tr. 35). He knew what he did was wrong (Tr. 29). \n   \nAfter his hearing, Applicant provided his own letter responding to two areas of \nconcern raised by myself and Department Counsel (AE P). Those concerns focused on \nApplicant\u2019s failure to fully admit the scope of his thefts to the victim, the bookstore and \nto his children (AE P).  \n \nApplicant provided a handwritten letter from his nine-year-old son (AE N). His \nson\u2019s letter indicated Applicant admitted the theft of the books to him, and was very \nsorry for what he did (AE N). \n \n\n \n        4 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                        \nOn April 24, 2009, Applicant sent a three-page, certified, return receipt letter to \nthe management of the bookstore chain that was a victim of his larcenies (AE O). He \ndescribed his efforts to apologize and make restitution for his thefts (AE O). In June \n2007 (AE A), and November 2007, he sent letters of apology (AE O). He then discussed \nthe theft and apology with the manager of one bookstore, who accepted his apology \n(GE 2). In July 2008, he sent another letter of apology and a $250 check (AE B), which \nthe bookstore donated to charity (AE O). In his April 24, 2009, letter he explained that \nprior to being caught he had stolen from the bookstore about a dozen times (AE O). He \nprovided a detailed description of his misconduct, including a list of the books he took \n(AE O). He donated the stolen books to charity in 2006, and his letter offered to make \nadditional restitution, if the bookstore so desired (AE O).     \n \nApplicant has fully admitted his misconduct. He was very ashamed of his \nconduct. He has repeatedly apologized for stealing books to the victim, to his family and \nto his government. He has shown his heart-felt remorse in his oral and written \ncommunications. His demeanor was very sincere, candid and contrite.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s evaluations described his extraordinary diligence, attention to detail, \nand responsibility (AE G). He has strong organization skills and is an efficient problem \nsolver. He either met or exceeded all performance standards (AE G).  The only flaw in \nhis personnel records relates to his arrest for shoplifting (AE G). \n \nApplicant\u2019s manager has supervised him for the last five years (AE E). He is \nreliable, solid, productive and honest (AE E). \n \nAnother manager has supervised Applicant for several years (AE F). He \ndescribed Applicant as diligent, trustworthy, reliable, forthcoming and committed to his \ncompany and the United States. This manager recommended reinstatement of \nApplicant\u2019s security clearance (AE F). \n \nPolicies \n \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the \nExecutive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security \nemphasizing, \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. \nEgan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the \nauthority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine \nwhether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. \nat 527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.    \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the Applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not \ninflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \n\n \n        5 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                        \nadministrative judge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common \nsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  \n \nThe government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. Clearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the [A]pplicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. \nOr. 10865 \u00a7 7. See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), Section 3. Thus, \nnothing in this Decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, \nin whole or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant\u2019s allegiance, \nloyalty, or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has not met the strict \nguidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a \nclearance. \n \nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the Applicant that may disqualify the Applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an Applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).      \n \nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the Applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An Applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of \ndisproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the government. See ISCR Case No. \n02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, \nif they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).   \n \nAnalysis \n \n  \nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all \nappropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, I conclude the relevant security \nconcern is under Guidelines J (criminal conduct) and E (personal conduct) with respect \nto the allegations set forth in the SOR. \n \n \n \n\n \n        6 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                        \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct \n \nAG \u00b6 30 expresses the security concern pertaining to criminal conduct, \u201cCriminal \nactivity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. By its \nvery nature, it calls into question a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, \nrules and regulations.\u201d \n \nAG \u00b6 31 describes two conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying, \u00b6 31(a), \u201ca single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses,\u201d and \u00b6 31(c), \n\u201callegation or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was \nformally charged, formally prosecuted or convicted.\u201d  \n \nApplicant admitted that he knowingly and deliberately stole books from a \nbookstore on about 12 occasions from February to June 2006. These thefts were \nmisdemeanors, rather than felonies, because the value of the books stolen was less \nthan $500. This admission was re-stated to an OPM investigator, in his SOR response, \nat his hearing, and in a post-hearing letter to the victim. AG \u00b6\u00b6 31(a) and 31(b) are \nestablished. \n \nAG \u00b6 32 provides four conditions that could potentially mitigate security concerns: \n \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment; \n \n(b) the person was pressured or coerced into committing the act and those \npressures are no longer present in the person's life; \n \n(c) evidence that the person did not commit the offense; and \n \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited \nto the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or \nrestitution, job training or higher education, good employment record, or \nconstructive community involvement. \n \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 32(b) and 32(c) do not apply. He admitted the thefts and was not \npressured to commit the thefts. The thefts occurred about three years ago, which is \nsomewhat recent. Because there are about a dozen criminal offenses, they are not \n\u201cisolated.\u201d  \n \nHowever, the thefts do not continue to cast doubt on Applicant\u2019s current \nreliability, trustworthiness and good judgment because he has been rehabilitated. The \npolice only had evidence of one theft. He admitted a dozen thefts of books. He \nexpressed his remorse, has continued to receive job training, has a good employment \nrecord and some community involvement in the scouts. He apologized to the victim, his \nfamily and the government. Criminal activity has not recurred. He eventually accepted \n\n \n        7 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                        \nfull responsibility for his misconduct. No other employment problems have surfaced. His \npost-offense behavior is sufficient to fully mitigate the misconduct in this case as \ndescribed in the SOR.  AG \u00b6\u00b6 32(a) and 32(d) apply. \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern pertaining to personal conduct: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. . . . \n \nAG \u00b6 16 describes two conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying: \n \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply \nwith rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the \nperson may not properly safeguard protected information. This includes \nbut is not limited to consideration of: \n \n(1) untrustworthy or unreliable behavior to include breach of client \nconfidentiality, release of proprietary information, unauthorized release of \nsensitive corporate or other government protected information: \n \n(2) disruptive, violent, or other inappropriate behavior in the workplace;  \n \n(3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations; \n \n(4) evidence of significant misuse of Government or other employer's time \nor resources; and  \n \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one's conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress, such \nas (1) engaging in activities which, if known, may affect the person's \npersonal, professional, or community standing, or (2) while in another \ncountry, engaging in any activity that is illegal in that country or that is \nlegal in that country but illegal in the United States and may serve as a \nbasis for exploitation or pressure by the foreign security or intelligence \nservice or other group. \n \nApplicant engaged in a series of misdemeanor-level thefts from February to July \n2006 at a bookstore. Such thefts are rule violations and show a pattern of dishonesty. \n\n \n        8 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                        \nThey show untrustworthy or unreliable behavior. AG \u00b6 16(d)(3) applies. Shoplifting is \nvery damaging to one\u2019s personal, professional and community standing. Applicant was \nvery reluctant to disclose to his family his thefts. It is clear that he did not want his \nneighbors and acquaintances in the community to know about his conduct. AG \u00b6 \n16(e)(1) applies.       \n \nAG \u00b6 17 provides seven conditions that could mitigate security concerns in this \ncase: \n \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was \ncaused or significantly contributed to by improper or inadequate advice of \nauthorized personnel or legal counsel advising or instructing the individual \nspecifically concerning the security clearance process. Upon being made \naware of the requirement to cooperate or provide the information, the \nindividual cooperated fully and truthfully; \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, \nor other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur; \n \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress;  \n \n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable \nreliability; and \n \n(g) association with persons involved in criminal activity has ceased or \noccurs under circumstances that do not cast doubt upon the individual's \nreliability, trustworthiness, judgment, or willingness to comply with rules \nand regulations. \n \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 17(a), 17(b), 17(f) and 17(g) do not apply. The personal conduct concern \ndoes not relate to falsification of security documents. The allegations of theft are \nsubstantiated and his decision was not influence by his associations with others. \n \nAG \u00b6 17(c), 17(d) and 17(e) all apply because \u201cit happened under such unique \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's \nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d He is sincerely remorseful about his \n\n \n        9 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                        \nmisconduct, and it is very unlikely to recur. He acknowledged the behavior and \napologized to the victim orally and in writing. He confessed a dozen larcenies to an \nOPM investigator, and followed up with admitting the multiple thefts to the victim, in his \nSOR response and at his hearing. Disclosure has reduced his vulnerability to \nexploitation, manipulation, or duress. He paid restitution, even though it was not \nrequired by the court. He completed his probation. He paid his fine. He disclosed his \nconduct to security officials and his family. His employer knows about the arrest (his \nsupervisor noted his conduct in an evaluation). He does not have a conviction because \nhe received deferred adjudication. He has done everything that he reasonably can do to \nestablish his rehabilitation.   \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n Under the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole person concept. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guidelines J and E in my whole person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(a) \nwere addressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional comment. \n \nThere is some evidence supporting continued revocation of Applicant\u2019s \nclearance. He was a mature adult when he committed approximately a dozen \nmisdemeanor-level thefts. Applicant had a problem with shoplifting books from a \nbookstore from February to July 2006. He was caught when his theft became \nparticularly flagrant. He stole three shopping bags of books and was arrested. He was \nunable to explain why he was stealing books. His decisions to steal were \nknowledgeable, voluntary, and intentional. He was sufficiently mature to be fully \nresponsible for his conduct. These thefts show a lack of judgment and a deliberate \nfailure to abide by the law. His thefts show a lack of integrity and such conduct raises a \nserious security concern.     \n \nThe evidence supporting approval of Applicant\u2019s clearance is more substantial.  \nHe pleaded no contest to his theft on July 19, 2006. He received deferred adjudication, \nand nine months of probation. He completed four hours of counseling and about 20 \n\n \n        10 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                        \nhours of community service. He paid his fine and court costs. He admitted his theft on \nhis security clearance application. When an OPM investigator questioned Applicant, he \nadmitted a dozen thefts of books from the same chain of bookstores. Since July 19, \n2006, he has not committed any more thefts. He frankly and candidly admitted his thefts \nto his family and to the victim. He subsequently admitted his thefts in his response to \nDOHA interrogatories and his SOR response. He knows the consequences of criminal \nactivity. Applicant contributes to his company and the Department of Defense. There is \nno evidence at work of any other disciplinary problems. There is no evidence of \ndisloyalty or that he would intentionally violate national security. His character and good \nwork performance show his responsibility, rehabilitation and mitigation. His supervisors \nevidently support him or he would not have been able to retain his employment after his \nsecurity clearance was called into question. After weighing the disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions, and all the facts and circumstances, in the context of the whole \nperson, I conclude he has mitigated the security concerns pertaining to criminal conduct \nand personal conduct.  \n  \nI take this position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v.

Coacher, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\n \nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On October 29, 2008, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant\nof the basis for that decision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline J (Criminal Conduct) and\nGuideline E (Personal Conduct) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992), as\namended (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.  On June 23, 2009, after the hearing,\nAdministrative Judge Charles D. Ablard granted Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.\nDepartment Counsel appealed pursuant to the Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nDepartment Counsel raises the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s conclusions\nunder Guidelines J and E are arbitrary and capricious because they are unsupported by the record \nevidence; and whether the Judge\u2019s whole-person analysis is unsustainable because it is contrary to\nand unsupported by the totality of the record evidence.  Finding error, we reverse the Judge\u2019s\ndecision.\n\n2\nWhether the Record Supports the Judge\u2019s Factual Findings\nA.  Facts\nThe Judge made the following relevant factual findings: Applicant is 39 years old and has\na master\u2019s degree in mathematics.  In July 2006, Applicant was arrested and charged with theft after\nhe left a bookstore carrying three shopping bags of books without paying for them.  Applicant\npleaded no contest, and the court deferred adjudication.  In a security investigation in 2007,\nApplicant admitted to an investigator that he had stolen books from the same chain of bookstores\napproximately ten times between February and June 2006 without being caught.  Applicant told the\ninvestigator that he doubted that \u201che would ever have the nerve to tell [the bookstore] about the other\nstolen books.\u201d  Decision at 3.  At the time of the hearing, Applicant had told his wife, his parents,\nand his employer about the thefts.  However, he had not told his children.  After the hearing,\nApplicant told his two older children and the management of the bookstore about his behavior and\nsubmitted evidence to that effect.  Applicant\u2019s employer knows of his thefts and still praises him and\nrecommends reinstatement of his security clearance.\nB.  Discussion \n \nThe Appeal Board\u2019s review of the Judge\u2019s findings of facts is limited to determining if they\nare supported by substantial evidence\u2013\u201csuch relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept\nas adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the same record.\u201d\nDirective  \u00b6 E3.1.32.1.  \u201cThis is something less than the weight of the evidence, and the possibility\nof drawing two inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent an administrative\nagency\u2019s finding from being supported by substantial evidence.\u201d  Consolo v. Federal Maritime\nComm\u2019n, 383 U.S. 607, 620 (1966).  In evaluating the Judge\u2019s findings, the Board shall give\ndeference to the Judge\u2019s credibility determinations.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1.\nDepartment Counsel has not challenged the above factual findings.  Therefore, they are not\nat issue on appeal.  Department Counsel\u2019s appeal concerns the Judge\u2019s conclusions, which will be\ndiscussed below.\nWhether the Record Supports the Judge\u2019s Ultimate Conclusions\n A Judge is required to \u201cexamine the relevant data and articulate a satisfactory explanation\nfor\u201d the decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.\u2019\u201d\nMotor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n of the United States v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43\n(1983)(quoting Burlington Truck Lines, Inc. v. United States, 371 U.S. 156, 168 (1962)).  \u201cThe\ngeneral standard is that a clearance may be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests\nof the national security.\u2019\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  The Appeal\nBoard may reverse the Judge\u2019s decision to grant, deny, or revoke a security clearance if it is arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.  Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.32.3 and E3.1.33.3.  \n\n\u201c[S]o much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it happened under such unusual\n1\ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment;\u201d . . . and \u201cthere is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited to the passage of time without\nrecurrence of criminal activity, remorse or restitution, job training or higher education, or constructive community\ninvolvement[.]\u201d  Directive \u00b6 E2.32(a) and (d).\n \n3\nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility, there is a strong\npresumption against the grant or maintenance of a security clearance.  See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913\nF. 2d 1399, 1401 (9  Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991).  After the Government presents\nth\nevidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or\nmitigate those concerns.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  \u201cThe application of disqualifying and mitigating\nconditions and whole person factors does not turn simply on a finding that one or more of them apply\nto the particular facts of a case.  Rather, their application requires the exercise of sound discretion\nin light of the record evidence as a whole.\u201d  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 05-03635 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec.\n20, 2006).\nIn deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are arbitrary or capricious, the Board\nwill review the Judge's decision to determine whether:  it does not examine relevant evidence; it fails\nto articulate a satisfactory explanation for its conclusions, including a rational connection between\nthe facts found and the choice made; it does not consider relevant factors; it reflects a clear error of\njudgment; it fails to consider an important aspect of the case; it offers an explanation for the decision\nthat runs contrary to the record evidence; or it is so implausible that it cannot be ascribed to a mere\ndifference of opinion.  In deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are contrary to law,\nthe Board will consider whether they are contrary to provisions of Executive Order 10865, the\nDirective, or other applicable federal law.  See ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Jun. 2,\n2006).\nDepartment Counsel contends that the Judge\u2019s conclusions under Guidelines J and E are\narbitrary and capricious because they are unsupported by the record evidence.  Department Counsel\u2019s\ncontention has merit.  The Judge found significant security concerns under Guidelines J and E, but\nfound Applicant\u2019s conduct to be mitigated under both Guidelines.\nUnder Guideline J, the Judge applied Criminal Conduct Mitigating Conditions (CCMC) (a)\nand (d).   The Judge himself stated that Applicant\u2019s thefts were \u201csomewhat recent\u201d and that, because\n1\nthe thefts occurred on about 12 occasions, \u201cthey are not \u2018isolated.\u2019\u201d  Decision at 6.  However, the\nJudge found that \u201cthe thefts do not continue to cast doubt on Applicant\u2019s current reliability,\ntrustworthiness and good judgment because he has been rehabilitated.\u201d  Id.  To reach his conclusion\nof mitigation, the Judge engaged in a piecemeal analysis of the record.  In his analysis, the Judge\nminimized Applicant\u2019s behavior and failed to consider the totality of that behavior and its security\nimplications.  Such analysis constitutes error.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 04-12648 at 3-4 (App. Bd.\nOct. 20, 2006).  The record evidence does not support the Judge\u2019s findings of rehabilitation,\nespecially in light of the nature and seriousness of Applicant\u2019s conduct and the fact that Applicant\nhimself cannot explain why the conduct occurred.  Applicant\u2019s thefts occurred only three years\n\nAs noted above, Applicant told an investigator that he did not think he could ever bring himself to inform the\n2\ncompany about the earlier thefts.  Prior to the hearing, Applicant wrote to the company three times\u2014to ask for leniency,\nto request that the Order of Trespass preventing him from entering the store be lifted, and to request formal\ndocumentation that the Order of Trespass had been lifted.  However, he did not mention the other thefts in those letters.\nAt the hearing, Applicant stated that he feared further criminal proceedings.  Decision at 3.  Applicant testified that he\nhad intended to inform the company of the earlier thefts after three years had passed.  Transcript at 39.  After being\nquestioned on the issue at the hearing, Applicant wrote to the company immediately after the hearing and submitted a\ncopy of the letter as evidence.    \n\u201c[T]he offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is so infrequent, or it happened under\n3\nsuch unique circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability,\ntrustworthiness, or good judgment;\u201d\n\u201cthe individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling to change the behavior or taken other\npositive steps to alleviate the stressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, or other\ninappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur;\u201d\nand \u201cthe individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation,\nor duress[.]\u201d Directive \u00b6 E2.17(c), (d), and (e). \n4\nbefore the hearing.  There were ten to twelve thefts over a five-month period, and Applicant\u2019s\nbehavior involved poor judgment, lack of reliability, untrustworthiness, and risk-taking which could\nhave serious security implications.  The Board has held that \u201c[t]he more serious or long-term an\napplicant\u2019s conduct is, the stronger the evidence of rehabilitation needs to be for the Judge to find\nthe applicant has overcome the negative security implications of that conduct.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 94-\n0964 at 6 (App. Bd. Jul. 3, 1996).  Moreover, Applicant did not admit to the bookstore management\nthe thefts other than the one for which he was caught until after the hearing.   Considering the record\n2\nas a whole, the Judge\u2019s reliance on CCMC (a) and (d) is not sustainable. \nUnder Guideline E, the Judge applied Personal Conduct Mitigating Conditions (PCMC) (c),\n(d), and (e).   Here also, the Judge stated that Applicant\u2019s thefts are \u201cvery unlikely to recur\u201d and do\n3\nnot cast doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment, and therefore the Judge found\nmitigation under Guideline E.  Decision at 8-9.  The record as a whole does not support the Judge\u2019s\napplication of PCMC (c), (d), and (e).  For the reasons that follow, the Judge\u2019s conclusions that\nApplicant\u2019s thefts are very unlikely to recur and do not cast doubt on Applicant\u2019s reliability,\ntrustworthiness, or good judgment, are not sustainable.\nThe Judge\u2019s application of mitigation is also related to his finding that Applicant \u201chas done\neverything the he reasonably can do to establish his rehabilitation.\u201d  The record contains evidence\nfrom which the Judge could find that Applicant reduced his vulnerability to duress, but the\nconclusion about Applicant\u2019s rehabilitation is also based, significantly, on the finding that the\ncircumstances were \u201cunique\u201d and are \u201cvery unlikely to recur.\u201d Decision at 8-9.  In this regard, the\nJudge does not articulate any reasonable explanation as to why the circumstances in which Applicant\nfound himself were unique, how they prompted Applicant to engage in the conduct involved, and\nwhy such circumstances are very unlikely to recur.  As described above, Applicant himself cannot\nexplain why he engaged in this conduct.  Viewed objectively, the conduct reflects an unexplained,\nrecent and recurrent pattern of questionable judgment, risk-taking, lack of reliability and\n\n5\ntrustworthiness, and irresponsibility.  The passage of a significant amount of time without\nrecurrence, does not exist here; and no other evidence in the record plausibly tends to provide proof\nof rehabilitation.\nDepartment Counsel also contends that the Judge\u2019s whole-person analysis is unsustainable\nbecause it is contrary to and unsupported by the record evidence.  Department Counsel\u2019s contention\nhas merit.  A whole-person analysis is intended to be a commonsense evaluation of an applicant\u2019s\nconduct and circumstances as a whole.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 05-07983 at 6 (App. Bd. Oct. 1,\n2007).  Here, the Judge reviewed the evidence in a piecemeal manner, looking at individual acts and\ncircumstances, rather than the totality of Applicant\u2019s situation.  As explained in the preceding\nparagraph, the conduct reflects an unexplained, recent and recurring pattern of questionable\njudgment, risk-taking, lack of reliability and trustworthiness, and irresponsibility.  Directive \u00b6\nE2.2(d).  The record evidence does not support the Judge\u2019s decision.\nOrder\nThe Judge\u2019s decision granting Applicant a security clearance is REVERSED.\nSigned: Michael D.

He appeared in court on\nthat charge and it was dismissed. In 2007, he was convicted of Driving with a Blood Alcohol\nContent of 0.08 or more. He is currently serving a period of unmonitored summary\nprobation based on that conviction. He has mitigated the security concern caused by his\nalcohol consumption. \nOn September 4, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued\na Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant stating it was unable to find it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.1\nThe SOR alleges a security concern under Guideline G (alcohol consumption). Applicant\u2019s\nresponse to the SOR was received by DOHA on October 23, 2008. Applicant denied the\nallegation contained in SOR subparagraph 1.a, admitted the allegations contained in\nsubparagraphs 1.b-1.d, and requested a hearing.\nDEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE\nDEFENSE OFFICE OF HEARINGS AND APPEALS\nMarch 16, 2009\n\n2\nThe case was assigned to another administrative judge on January 5, 2009, and\nreassigned to me on January 22, 2009, due to caseload considerations. A notice of hearing\nwas issued on January 26, 2009, scheduling the hearing for February 20, 2009. The\nhearing was conducted as scheduled. The government submitted two documentary\nexhibits that were marked as Government Exhibits (GE) 1-2, and admitted into the record\nwithout objection. Applicant testified and submitted eight documentary exhibits that were\nmarked as Applicant Exhibits (AE) 1-8, and admitted into the record without objection. The\nrecord was held open to give Applicant the opportunity to submit additional documentation.\nOne document was timely received, marked as AE 9, and admitted into the record without\nobjection. A copy of an e-mail received from substitute Department Counsel indicating the\nGovernment did not object to AE 9 was marked as Appellate Exhibit (App. Ex.) I and made\na part of the record. The transcript was received on February 26, 2009.     \nFindings of Fact\nAfter a thorough review of the pleadings, testimony and exhibits, I make the\nfollowing findings of fact:\nApplicant is a 34-year-old single man who has been employed by a defense\ncontractor, currently with the title of security consultant, since August 1997. He graduated\nfrom high school in 1993, attended college until 1994, and has worked steadily since that\ntime. He has sporadically continued his education and has been steadily attending college\npart-time for the past three semesters. Applicant was a member of the Army Reserve\nOfficer Training Corps while he attended college from 1993-94.\nApplicant submitted letters from two co-workers and a woman who knows him\nthrough his involvement with her son in the Big Brothers program. They attest to his\nreputation for trustworthiness, dependability and being a dedicated employee who can be\ntrusted with access to classified information. His co-workers have seen him in social\nsituations where alcohol was being consumed and found his consumption to be\nresponsible and not to excess. Applicant\u2019s facility security officer submitted a letter verifying\nthat Applicant has not been involved in any security incidents and has been proactive in\nremaining current on security practices and completing security training.    \nApplicant was charged with Accident Damage to Unattended Vehicle or Property\nin June 2003. Applicant testified he consumed two beers prior to the accident which\ninvolved him sideswiping a parked automobile. The incident occurred near where Applicant\nwas staying and he parked his car without informing anyone of the accident. He was\nconvicted of the offense, fined $300 and assessed court costs of $79.\nIn July 2003, Applicant was charged with Public Drunkenness. He had been\nattending a bachelor party being held for a friend and consumed about eight drinks during\nthe course of visiting about four different bars. He and his friends had rented two hotel\nrooms and he admits he passed out in the friends\u2019 room because he had consumed too\nmuch alcohol. His friends decided to carry him to his room, but on their way dropped him\nand left him laying in a hotel hallway. He appeared in court and the charge was dismissed.\n\n Applicant explained that a \u201cmileage run\u201d is flying from one location to another and back to acquire\n2\nfrequent flyer miles. \n Applicant was given the option of serving 13 days in jail or performing 13 days of what appears to\n3\nbe community service in lieu of paying the fines, but opted to pay the fine and costs.\n3\nIn May 2007, Applicant conducted a \u201cmileage run\u201d  consisting of four flights. The trip\n2\nbegan in the morning on one coast and consisted of two legs to reach the other coast and\ntwo more legs to arrive back at his starting point. Applicant received complimentary\nupgrades and the corresponding free alcoholic beverages on the flights and consumed\nabout ten mixed drinks and four glasses of wine. He stopped drinking a couple of hours\nbefore the last flight landed and mistakenly thought he was sober enough to operate an\nautomobile.\nApplicant was driving from the airport to his girlfriend\u2019s house when he was stopped\nby police. His blood alcohol content (BAC) was 0.12 when he was arrested. He was\ncharged with Driving Under the Influence (DUI) and  Driving with a Blood Alcohol Content\nof 0.08 or more (DUI-BAC). \nOn July 10, 2007, Applicant\u2019s attorney appeared in court without Applicant being\npresent and entered a plea of nolo contendere to the DUI-BAC charge. The DUI charge\nwas dismissed. The imposition of sentence was suspended and Applicant was placed on\nsummary probation for a period of 36 months with the following conditions: serve one day\nin jail with credit for one day served, pay a fine, costs and restitution totaling $1,703,3\nparticipate in and successfully complete a 3-month licensed first-offender alcohol and drug\neducation and counseling program, attend ten alcoholics anonymous (AA) meetings at the\nrate of two times per week, and various other admonitions dealing with compliance with\ndriving requirements. Applicant paid all fines and costs, complied with all other terms of the\nsummary probation, and submitted proof of compliance to the court on October 26, 2007.\nApplicant\u2019s case was marked as \u201cclosed\u201d based on his completing all conditions of\nthe summary probation. His remaining time on probation is unmonitored and the only\nobligation he owes to the court is to comply with all laws. The next scheduled event in\nApplicant\u2019s case is the termination of probation, which is scheduled to occur in July 2010.\nApplicant\u2019s driving privileges are suspended in the state where the DUI-BAC offense\noccurred. He can apply for reinstatement of those driving privileges at any time, but,\nbecause he has a valid driver\u2019s license in the state where he now lives and he no longer\nhas reason to drive in the state where the offense occurred, he has not applied for\nreinstatement of those privileges.  \nApplicant completed the court-ordered alcohol counseling and education program\non October 21, 2007. He began the court-ordered attendance at AA meetings on\nSeptember 27, 2007, and completed them on October 23, 2007. He still attends AA\nmeetings on an irregular basis about once a month and has the telephone number of a\nsponsor in the event he feels the need to talk to someone. Applicant testified at some\n\n4\nlength about what he learned at the AA meetings he attended and how they have affected\nhis lifestyle. For example, Applicant testified as follows:\nWhere I\u2019d just came to the realization, after going to those meetings, that I\nwas extremely fortunate. Everyone there had just awful situations that I just\ncould not believe. \nThey didn\u2019t seem, it was just really, really surprising as to how horrible some\nof the situations were. Specifically, some of the AA cases where you go to\nthese meetings and you listen to these stories and it\u2019s just some of the most\ngut-wrenching stuff I\u2019ve ever heard.\nAnd I realized at that point that I did not want any part of that in my life.\n* * * \nI came to a realization that that\u2019s just not an important part of my life\nanymore. It never was. It was something I think I was just being lazy about\nand I let it get the best of me, in a couple of circumstances.\nBut now it\u2019s not important at all. It\u2019s minimized. I\u2019m more focused on my\ncareer than I ever have before, especially my education.\nSo between those two things and pursuing a few personal relationships, I\ndon\u2019t have time for it, it\u2019s just not important. I do not want anything to do with\nthat lifestyle. (Tr. 30-32)\nThe impact of the alcohol education program and attendance at AA meetings was so great\non Applicant that he terminated a long-term relationship with a woman he had planned on\nmarrying because he realized it was one of the influences in his life that caused him to\noccasionally abuse alcohol.\nApplicant continues to consume alcohol in moderation in social settings. In response\nto an interrogatory that was propounded to him by the Government in June 2008, Appellant\nstated he drinks to the point of intoxication once every three to four months and the last\ntime he was intoxicated was on April 27, 2008. He testified at length to what he meant by\nthose statements and made clear that he interprets \u201cintoxication\u201d to mean having\nconsumed any quantity of alcohol that might impair one\u2019s ability to operate an automobile.\nThe April 27, 2008 intoxication he referred to consisted of him consuming three or four\ndrinks while he was a spectator at a hockey game he attended with a friend.      \nPOLICIES\nThe Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when evaluating a\nperson\u2019s eligibility to hold a security clearance. Chief among them are the disqualifying and\nmitigating conditions for each applicable guideline. Additionally, each clearance decision\nmust be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based upon the relevant and material\nfacts and circumstances, the whole person concept, and the factors listed in \u00b6 6.3.1\n\n ISCR Case No. 96-0277 (July 11, 1997) at p. 2.\n4\n ISCR Case No. 97-0016 (December 31, 1997) at p. 3; Directive, Enclosure 3, Item E3.1.14. \n5\n Department of the Navy v. Egan 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988).\n6\n ISCR Case No. 01-20700 (December 19, 2002) at p. 3 (citations omitted).\n7\n ISCR Case No. 98-0761 (December 27, 1999) at p. 2.\n8\n ISCR Case No. 94-1075 (August 10, 1995) at pp. 3-4; Directive, Enclosure 3, Item E3.1.15.\n9\n ISCR Case No. 93-1390 (January 27, 1995) at pp. 7-8; Directive, Enclosure 3, Item E3.1.15.\n10\n Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, 531.\n11\n Id at 531.\n12\n Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive.\n13\n5\nthrough \u00b6 6.3.6 of the Directive. Although the presence or absence of a particular condition\nor factor for or against clearance is not outcome determinative, the adjudicative guidelines\nshould be followed whenever a case can be measured against this policy guidance.\nConsidering the evidence as a whole, Guideline G (alcohol consumption) with its\ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions, is most relevant in this case. \n  \nThe sole purpose of a security clearance decision is to decide if it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for an\napplicant.  The government has the burden of proving controverted facts.  The burden of\n4\n5\nproof in a security clearance case is something less than a preponderance of evidence,6\nalthough the government is required to present substantial evidence to meet its burden of\nproof.  \u201cSubstantial evidence is more than a scintilla, but less than a preponderance of the\n7\nevidence.\u201d  Once the government has met its burden, the burden shifts to an applicant to\n8\npresent evidence of refutation, extenuation, or mitigation to overcome the case against\nhim.  Additionally, an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable\n9\nclearance decision.10\nNo one has a right to a security clearance  and \u201cthe clearly consistent standard\n11\nindicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of\ndenials.\u201d   Any reasonable doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access\n12\nto classified information must be resolved in favor of protecting national security.      \n13\n\n6\nAnalysis\nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment\nor the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability\nand trustworthiness. (Adjudicative Guideline [AG] \u00b6 21)  \nApplicant consumed a modest amount of alcohol before he was involved in a\nproperty damage accident that he failed to report in June 2003. He was found guilty of a\nnon-alcohol related traffic offense, fined $300 and assessed court costs of $79. He\nattended a bachelor party a month later, obviously drank excessively, and passed out in\nthe hotel room of some friends. The friends, in an effort to carry him to his own room in the\nsame hotel, dropped him and left him laying in a hallway. He was charged with Public\nDrunkenness, attended court, and the charge was dismissed. \nIn May 2007, Applicant consumed an excessive amount of complimentary alcohol\nthat was provided to him by an airline. He was stopped by police as he was driving from\nan airport to his girlfriend\u2019s house and was charged with DUI and DUI-BAC. His BAC was\n0.12. In July 2007, he entered a plea of nolo contendere to the DUI-BAC charge through\nan attorney and was placed on 36 months unmonitored summary probation with various\nconditions. He completed all conditions of the summary probation by October 2007, and\nhas no continuing obligation under the probation other than to comply with all laws. \nDisqualifying Conditions (DC): 22(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such\nas driving while under the influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace,\nor other incidents of concern, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an\nalcohol abuser or alcohol dependent applies. The record substantiates only two situational\nalcohol-related offenses that were separated by four years. Appellant\u2019s remaining use of\nalcohol use cannot properly be categorized as either habitual or binge consumption. Thus,\nDC 22(c): habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired judgment,\nregardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol\ndependent does not apply. The remaining disqualifying conditions have no applicability to\nthe facts of this case. \nAppellant convincingly testified about the effects his 2007 arrest and conviction, and\nhis attendance at the alcohol counseling and education program and AA meetings have\nhad on his lifestyle. His testimony, quick compliance with all conditions of probation, the\nchanges in his personal life and his use of alcohol, his continuing, albeit limited, attendance\nat AA meetings, his educational accomplishments, and the letters of recommendation he\nsubmitted clearly establish he has learned from his past transgressions and he is unlikely\nto abuse alcohol in the future. Mitigating Conditions (MC) 23(a): so much time has passed,\nor the behavior was so infrequent, or it happened under such unusual circumstances that\nit is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability,\ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; and MC 23(b): the individual acknowledges his or her\nalcoholism or issues of alcohol abuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this\n\n7\nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence (if alcohol dependent) or responsible\nuse (if an alcohol abuser) apply.\n  \nThe objective of the security-clearance process is the fair-minded, commonsense\nassessment of a person\u2019s trustworthiness and fitness for access to classified information.\nIndeed, the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept recognizes we should view a person by the totality of\ntheir acts and omissions. Each case must be adjudged on its own merits, taking into\nconsideration all relevant circumstances, and applying sound judgment, mature thinking,\nand careful analysis. Considering all relevant and material facts and circumstances present\nin this case, the whole person concept, the factors listed in \u00b6 6.3.1 through \u00b66.3.6 of the\nDirective, and the applicable disqualifying and mitigating conditions, I find Applicant has\nmitigated the security concern caused by his alcohol consumption. He has overcome the\ncase against him and satisfied his burden of persuasion. Guideline G is decided for\nApplicant. It is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant a security\nclearance. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as\nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline G:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a-d:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.\nClearance is granted.\nHenry Lazzaro\nAdministrative Judge\n\n",

Clearance is granted. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted a Security Clearance Application, on April 15, 2004. On \nSeptember 4, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under Guideline F for \nApplicant. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department \nof Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative \nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective \nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on September 29, 2008, and requested \na hearing before an Administrative Judge. Department Counsel was prepared to \nproceed on October 19, 2008, and I received the case assignment on October 21, \nDecember 30, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \n2008. On October 31, 2008, I submitted a request to the hearing office to schedule \nthis case to be heard on December 3, 2008. Delay in setting this case was due to \nschedule conflicts. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on November 12, 2008, \nscheduling the hearing for December 3, 2008. The hearing was held as scheduled. \n \nThe Government offered Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 4, which were \nreceived without objection.

Applicant timely submitted \nAE 1 through 15 without objection. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on \nDecember 11, 2008.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant admitted SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a., 1.b., 1.e., 1.g., and 1.k.

After Applicant\u2019s divorce from his first wife, he relocated to another part of \nthe U.S. Debts alleged are directly related to his divorce or move. Applicant\u2019s costs \nassociated with his divorce and move are $17,427. He has paid $52,840 in child \nsupport from June 2002 to December 2008. Applicant\u2019s divorce was bitter, protracted, \nand costly. Applicant describes his former wife as \u201ccontinuing to remain defiant with \ncourt orders related to my oldest son\u2026 .\u201d He continues to be frustrated in exercising \nhis visitation rights with his son, and must bear the legal and travel costs associated \nwith exercising those rights. Applicant was also involved in an automobile accident in \nAugust 2006 leaving him with unreimbursed medical expenses. GE 2, AE 8. \n \nApplicant considered bankruptcy, but was advised \u201cthat (bankruptcy) would be \nan instant killer for my security clearance.\u201d GE 2. The primary obstacle Applicant has \nencountered in attempting to settle with his creditors is the amounts the creditors \nrequire. He has not been able to convince them that his available income is insufficient \nto meet their demands. He will; however, continue his efforts to resolve his debts. \nApplicant\u2019s wife is a real estate agent. Given the current state of the market, her \ncommissions have decreased significantly. In 2008, she has earned only one $2,800 \ncommission in July. Those funds were applied towards Applicant\u2019s attorney fees and \nvisitation costs. Tr. 100. Applicant submitted a comprehensive budget that shows a \nnet monthly remainder of $488. A review of his budget reflects that he and his family \nlive a modest lifestyle. He has also taken on part-time work to augment their income. \nAE 7. \n \nApplicant provided four reference letters. Three of the letters are work-related \nand provide favorable comments about his character and trustworthiness. The fourth \nletter is from his pastor and advises Applicant attends church every Sunday, is a man \nof integrity and is very loyal to his family and parish. Applicant also submitted \nevaluations, awards and citations from his naval service, and performance evaluations \nfrom his civilian employers. All of the reference/work-related documents reflect that \nApplicant has been and is a consistent top-notch performer. He has a demonstrated \ntrack \nrecord \nof \nbeing \na \ntrustworthy \nindividual \nand \nan \nasset \nto \nhis \norganization/employer. AE A (TAB 2). \n \n\n \n5 \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In \naddition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative \nguidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are \nuseful in evaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 \n2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based \non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration \nof the possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \n \n\n \n6 \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n  \n  \nUnder AG 18, the Government\u2019s concern is: \n \n\u201c[f]ailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.\u201d \n \n \nThe Government established that Applicant owes debts alleged in SOR, less \nduplicates, through Applicant\u2019s admissions and evidence presented.  \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 19, two disqualifying conditions raise a security concern: \n \n(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \nApplicant\u2019s separation, divorce, move, and post-divorce expenses have been \nvery costly. He has yet to completely recover from this major setback and move on \nfinancially with his second wife and family. He is; however, making good faith efforts to \ncome to terms with his creditors. These efforts are thoroughly documented.  \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 20, there are five potentially mitigating conditions: \n \n(a) the conditions happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), \nand \nthe \nindividual \nacted \nresponsibly \nunder \nthe \ncircumstances;  \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control; \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; and \n\n \n7 \n \n                                                          \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \nThe facts of this case warrant application of all five of the mitigating conditions, \nin whole or in part. The financial difficulties Applicant is experiencing are directly \nrelated to his divorce from his first wife. He has been challenged, emotionally and \nfinancially, in exercising his parental visitation rights. However, the collateral affects of \nhis divorce are leveling off. In addition to his separation and divorce, he was involved \nin an automobile accident in 2006. He has sought financial counseling on his own and \nthrough his employer. He established a number of his debts are duplicates, debts \nwhich have increased over time due to interest and penalties. Although Applicant has \nyet to resolve all of his past indebtedness, he has demonstrated he is making a good-\nfaith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. In short, Applicant \nhas demonstrated financial responsibility. He has established a viable budget, which \nshows a net remainder after he has paid his bills, and is able to save money. \n \nTo conclude, Applicant presented sufficient evidence to explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate the financial considerations security concerns. Applicant met his ultimate \nburden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision. In reaching this \nconclusion, the whole person concept was given due consideration and that analysis \ndoes support a favorable decision. \n \nI take this position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518 (1988), my \u201ccareful consideration of the whole person factors\u201d1 and \nsupporting evidence, my application of the pertinent factors under the Adjudicative \nProcess, and my interpretation of my responsibilities under the Guidelines. Applicant \nhas mitigated or overcome the government\u2019s case. For the reasons stated, I conclude \nhe is eligible for access to classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a. \u2013 1.l.:  \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n1 See ISCR Case No. 04-06242 at 2 (App. Bd.

Hess, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\nApril 29, 2009\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nLOKEY-ANDERSON, Darlene D., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted his Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing\n(e-QIP) on July 27, 2007.  On June 30, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and\nAppeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 (as amended), and Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, issued a Statement of\nReasons (SOR) to the Applicant, which detailed the reasons why DOHA could not make\nthe preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant and\nrecommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether a clearance\nshould be denied or revoked.\nThe Applicant responded to the SOR in writing on August 1, 2008, in which he\nelected to have the case determined on a written record in lieu of a hearing.\nDepartment Counsel submitted  the Government\u2019s File of Relevant Material (FORM) to\nthe Applicant on February 2, 2009.  The Applicant was instructed to submit information\nin rebuttal, extenuation or mitigation within 30 days of receipt.  Applicant received the\nFORM on February 6, 2009, and he submitted no reply.  The case was assigned to the\nundersigned for resolution on April 17, 2009.  Based upon a review of the FORM,\n\n \n2\nApplicant\u2019s responses and the exhibits, eligibility for access to classified information is\ndenied.\nFindings of Fact\nThe Applicant is 29 years old and unmarried.  He is employed by a defense\ncontractor as a PC Client Administrator, and is applying for a security clearance in\nconnection with his employment.\nThe Government opposes the Applicant's request for a security clearance, on the\nbasis of allegations set forth in the Statement of Reasons (SOR).  The following findings\nof fact are entered as to each paragraph and guideline in the SOR:\nParagraph 1 (Guideline D - Sexual Behavior).  The Government alleges in this\nparagraph that the Applicant is ineligible for clearance because his sexual behavior\ninvolved a criminal offense, is indicative of a personality or emotional disorder, reflects\nlack of judgment or discretion, or may subject the individual to undue influence or\ncoercion, or reflects lack of judgment or discretion.  \nParagraph 2 (Guideline E - Personal Conduct).  The Government alleges in this\nparagraph that the Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he engaged in conduct\ninvolving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply\nwith rules and regulations that raise questions abut his ability to protect classified\ninformation.   \nThe Applicant admits to the allegation set forth in the SOR under the respective\nguidelines set forth above.\nDuring an interview conducted by an authorized investigator for the Department\nof Defense, on October 3, 2007, the Applicant admitted that he was addicted to\npornography.  He explained that if anyone threatened to tell his family about his\naddiction, he would divulge information to them, possibly restricted or classified\ninformation to prevent his family from finding out.  A hypothetical presented to him by\nthe investigator was that if an attractive female solicited restricted or classified\ninformation from him, would he be tricked into providing that information to her.  The\nApplicant candidly acknowledged that it is possible that he could be tricked into talking\nabout it or be susceptible to being influenced due to his lack of social skills.      \nIn his Answer to the SOR dated August 1, 2008, Applicant stated that he views\npornography no less than 4 -7 times a week.  He believes that this sexual behavior\ncould provide someone with an opportunity for coercion or undue, blackmail or undue\ninfluence.  To negate the risk of blackmail or coercion, Applicant states that on July 25,\n2008, he told his parents about his pornography addiction.  I find the Applicant to be\ncandid and truthful.   \n\n \n3\nPolicies\nSecurity clearance decisions are not made in a vacuum.  Accordingly, the\nDepartment of Defense, in Enclosure 2 of the 1992  Directive sets forth policy factors\nand conditions that could raise or mitigate a security concern; which must be given\nbinding consideration in making security clearance determinations.  These factors\nshould be followed in every case according to the pertinent guidelines.  However, the\nconditions are neither automatically determinative of the decision in any case, nor can\nthey supersede the Administrative Judge\u2019s reliance on her own common sense.\nBecause each security clearance case presents its own unique facts and\ncircumstances, it cannot be assumed that these factors exhaust the realm of human\nexperience, or apply equally in every case.  Based on the Findings of Fact set forth\nabove, the factors most applicable to the evaluation of this case are:\nGuideline D -Sexual Behavior\n12.   The Concern.  Sexual Behavior that involves a criminal offense, indicates a\npersonality or emotional disorder, reflects lack of judgment or discretion, or which may\nsubject the individual to undue influence or coercion, exploitation, or duress can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified\ninformation.  No adverse inference concerning the standards in this Guideline may be\nraise solely on the basis of the sexual orientation of the individual.\nConditions that could raise a security concern:\n13(b) a pattern of compulsive, self-destructive, or high risk sexual behavior that\nthe person is unable to stop to that may be symptomatic of a personality disorder; \n13(c) sexual behavior that causes an individual to be vulnerable to coercion,\nexploitation, or duress;\nConditions that could mitigate security concerns:\nNone.\nGuideline E (Personal Conduct)\n15.  The Concern.  Conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor,\ndishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified\ninformation.  Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful and candid answers\nduring the security clearance process or any other failure to cooperate with the security\nclearance process.\n\n \n4\nConditions that could raise a security concern:\n16(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s conduct, that\ncreates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress, such as (1) engaging in\nactivities which, if known, may affect the person\u2019s personal, professional, or community\nstanding, or (2) while in another country, engaging in any activity that is illegal in that\ncountry or that is legal in that country but illegal in the United States may service as a\nbasis for exploitation or pressure by the foreign security or intelligence service or other\ngroup.\n  \nCondition that could mitigate security concerns:\nNone.\nIn addition, as set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive at pages 16-17, in\nevaluating the relevance of an individual\u2019s conduct, the Administrative Judge should\nconsider the following general factors:\na. The nature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding circumstances\nb. The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation\n \nc. The frequency and recency of the conduct\nd. The individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct\ne. The voluntariness of participation\nf. The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavior\nchanges\ng. The motivation for the conduct \nh. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress\ni. The likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nThe eligibility criteria established in the DoD Directive identify personal\ncharacteristics and conduct which are reasonably related to the ultimate question,\nposed in Section 2 of Executive Order 10865, of whether it is \u201cclearly consistent with the\nnational interest\u201d to grant an Applicant\u2019s request for access to classified information.\nThe DoD Directive states, \u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a\nsufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the person is\neligible for a security clearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is\npredicted upon the individual meeting these personnel security guidelines.  The\n\n \n5\nadjudicative process is the careful weighing of a number of variables known as the\nwhole person concept.  Available, reliable information about the person, past and\npresent, favorable and unfavorable should be considered in reaching a determination. \nThe Administrative Judge can draw only those inferences or conclusions that have\nreasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record.  The Judge cannot draw\ninferences or conclusions based on evidence which is speculative or conjectural in\nnature.  Finally, as emphasized by President Eisenhower in Executive Order 10865,\n\u201cAny determination under this order . . .  shall be a determination in terms of the national\ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the Applicant\nconcerned.\u201d\nThe Government must make out a case under Guideline D (Sexual Behavior)\nGuideline E (Personal Conduct) that establishes doubt about a person's judgment,\nreliability and trustworthiness.  While a rational connection, or nexus, must be shown\nbetween Applicant's adverse conduct and his ability to effectively safeguard classified\ninformation, with respect to sufficiency of proof of a rational connection, objective or\ndirect evidence is not required.\nThen, the Applicant must remove that doubt with substantial evidence in\nrefutation, explanation, mitigation or extenuation, which demonstrates that the past\nadverse conduct, is unlikely to be repeated, and that the Applicant presently qualifies for\na security clearance.  The Government must be able to place a high degree of\nconfidence in a security clearance holder to abide by all security rules and regulations,\nat all times and in all places.\nCONCLUSION\nHaving considered the evidence in light of the appropriate legal standards and\nfactors, and having assessed the Applicant's credibility based on the record, this\nAdministrative Judge concludes that the Government has established its case as to all\nallegations in the SOR, and that Applicant's pattern of inappropriate sexual behavior\nand personal conduct has a direct and negative impact on his suitability for access to\nclassified information.  \nThe Applicant admits that he is addicted to pornography.  Considering the\nevidence in totality, this demonstrates a pattern of inappropriate sexual behavior and\nhigh risk conduct that could subject the Applicant to pressure, coercion and/or\nblackmail, which in turn could subject the Government to a security risk.  \nApplicant\u2019s high risk behavior places him in a vulnerable position to be\nsusceptible to pressure, coercion and/or blackmail.  He currently views pornography at\nleast 4 - 7 times a week.  His addiction is a pattern of compulsive sexual behavior that\nhe cannot stop.  This behavior could provide someone the opportunity to coerce,\npressure or blackmail him into divulging sensitive, protected or classified information.\nAlthough the Applicant states that he recently told his parents about his addiction, there\nis no evidence in the record to show that his employer, co-workers, friends, members of\n\n6\nhis community or anyone else is aware of his addiction.  Thus, the risk is great that the\nApplicant may fall prey to exploitation, coercion or duress.  Applicant\u2019s pattern of high\nrisk behavior places the national interest at significant risk.  \nUnder Guideline D, Disqualifying Conditions 13(b), a pattern of compulsive, self-\ndestructive, or high risk sexual behavior that the person is unable to stop to that may be\nsymptomatic of a personality disorder and, 13(c), sexual behavior that causes an\nindividual to be vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or duress apply.  None of the\nmitigating conditions are even remotely applicable.  The Applicant has not met his\nburden of demonstrating that his sexual behavior does not raise a security concern, and\nGuideline D is found against the Applicant.\nWith respect to the Applicant\u2019s personal conduct, Under Guideline E,\nDisqualifying Condition 16(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about\none\u2019s conduct, that creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress, such\nas (1) engaging in activities which, if known, may affect the person\u2019s personal,\nprofessional, or community standing, or (2) while in another country, engaging in any\nactivity that is illegal in that country or that is legal in that country but illegal in the United\nStates may service as a basis for exploitation or pressure by the foreign security or\nintelligence service or other group applies.  None of the mitigating factors are\napplicable. Clearly, Applicant\u2019s addiction to pornography, if known, could affect his\npersonal, professional, or community standing.\n  \n \nI have also considered the \u201cwhole person concept\u201d in evaluating the Applicant\u2019s\neligibility for access to classified information.  Under the particular facts of this case, the\ntotality of the conduct set forth under all of the guidelines viewed as a whole, support a\nwhole person assessment of poor judgement, untrustworthiness, unreliability, an\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, and/or other characteristics\nindicating that the person may not properly safeguard classified information.\n  \nConsidering all of the evidence presented, it does not come close to mitigating\nthe negative effects of his sexual behavior and the impact that it can have on his ability\nto properly safeguard classified information.  On balance, it is concluded that the\nApplicant has failed to overcome the Government's case opposing his request for a\nsecurity clearance.  Accordingly, the evidence supports a finding against the Applicant\nas to the factual and conclusionary allegations expressed in Paragraphs 1 and 2 of the\nSOR.    \n\n7\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal Findings For or Against the Applicant on the allegations in the SOR, as\nrequired by Paragraph 25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive are:\n         Paragraph 1:   Against the Applicant.\nSubparagraph 1.a.:   Against the Applicant\nParagraph 2:   Against the Applicant\n Subparagraph 2.a.:  Against the Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly\nconsistent with the national interests to grant or continue a security clearance for the\nApplicant.\nDarlene Lokey Anderson\nAdministrative Judge\n",

After a thorough review of the pleadings, Applicant\u2019s response to the SOR, and the FORM, I make the following additional findings of fact. Applicant is a 28-year-old college graduate with a degree in Business Administration she earned in 2001. She has worked for defense contractors since 2001 and her current employer, also a defense contractor, since September 2007. (FORM, Item 5). When she submitted her security clearance application in November 2007, she disclosed she had used marijuana extensively from September 2000 to at least June 2007.

DeLaney, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nMALONE, Matthew E., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant has not mitigated the security concerns raised by the government\u2019s\ninformation about her illegal drug involvement. Accordingly, her request for a security\nclearance is denied.\nOn November 6, 2007, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for\nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP) to request a security clearance required as part of her\nemployment with a defense contractor. After reviewing the results of the ensuing\nbackground investigation, adjudicators for the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals\n(DOHA) were unable to make a preliminary affirmative finding  that it is clearly\n1\nconsistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s request. \nOn April 22, 2008, DOHA issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR),\nwhich specified the basis for its decision \u2013 security concerns addressed in the Directive\nAugust 28, 2008\n\n Adjudication of this case is controlled by the Revised Adjudicative Guidelines, approved by the President on\n2\nDecember 29, 2005,which were implemented by the Department of Defense on September 1, 2006. Pending\nofficial revision of the Directive, the Revised Adjudicative Guidelines supercede the guidelines listed in\nEnclosure 2 to the Directive, and they apply to all adjudications or trustworthiness determinations in which an\nSOR was issued on or after September 1, 2006.\n See Directive, Enclosure 3, Section E3.1.7. The FORM included six documents (Items 1 - 6) proffered in\n3\nsupport of the government\u2019s case.\n2\nunder Guideline H (Drug Involvement) of the Revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG).2\nMore specifically, the government alleged that Applicant used marijuana at least 100\ntimes between September 2000 and June 2007 (SOR \u00b6 1.a); that she used cocaine at\nleast 10 times between September 2000 and June 2007 (SOR \u00b6 1.b); that she used\necstacy at least four times between September 2000 and July 2006 (SOR \u00b6 1.c); and\nthat she purchased marijuana four or five times between September 2000 and June\n2007 (SOR \u00b6 1.d).\nOn May 13, 2008, Applicant answered the SOR and admitted all of the SOR\nallegations. She also requested a decision without a hearing. On May 30, 2008, DOHA\nDepartment Counsel submitted a file of relevant materials (FORM)  in support of the\n3\ngovernment\u2019s preliminary decision. Applicant received the FORM on June 6, 2008, and\nwas given 30 days to file a response to the FORM. She did not submit anything in\nresponse to the FORM. The case was assigned to me on August 15, 2008.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant\u2019s admissions in response to the SOR are admitted as fact. After a\nthorough review of the pleadings, Applicant\u2019s response to the SOR, and the FORM, I\nmake the following additional findings of fact.\nApplicant is a 28-year-old college graduate with a degree in Business\nAdministration she earned in 2001. She has worked for defense contractors since 2001\nand her current employer, also a defense contractor, since September 2007. (FORM,\nItem 5). When she submitted her security clearance application in November 2007, she\ndisclosed she had used marijuana extensively from September 2000 to at least June\n2007. She also disclosed several instances of cocaine use during the same period and\nsporadic use of a mood altering drug known as ecstacy prior to July 2006. (FORM, Item\n5) In response to interrogatories propounded by DOHA adjudicators, Applicant also\ndisclosed that on four or five occasions between September 2000 and June 2007, she\nbought marijuana to use with her friends at parties, spending about $50 for each\npurchase. (FORM, Item 6)\nApplicant asserts she no longer uses illegal drugs. She decided to stop using\nillegal drugs in June 2007, and in July 2007 moved away from the friends and\nacquaintances with whom she used drugs. Applicant\u2019s illegal drug use did not cause\nany financial, social, or other problems; however, she now wishes to live a healthier,\nmore productive lifestyle. She does not intend to use illegal drugs in the future. (FORM,\nItems 4, 5, and 6)\n\n Directive. 6.3.\n4\n See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988).\n5\n See Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, 531.\n6\n3\nPolicies\nEach security clearance decision must be a fair, impartial, and commonsense\ndetermination based on examination of all available relevant and material information,\nand consideration of the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in the Revised\nAdjudicative Guidelines (AG).  Decisions must also reflect consideration of the factors\n4\nlisted in \u00b6 2(a) of the new guidelines. Commonly referred to as the \u201cwhole person\u201d\nconcept, these factor are:\n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nThe presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not\ndeterminative of a conclusion for or against an applicant. However, specific applicable\nguidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against them as they\nrepresent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to classified\ninformation. In this case, the pleadings and the information presented by the parties\nrequire consideration of the security concerns and adjudicative factors addressed under\nGuideline H (drug involvement) at AG \u00b6 24.\nA security clearance decision is intended only to resolve whether it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest  for an applicant to either receive or continue to\n5\nhave access to classified information. The government bears the initial burden of\nproducing admissible information on which it based the preliminary decision to deny or\nrevoke a security clearance for an applicant. Additionally, the government must be able\nto prove controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If the government meets its burden, it\nthen falls to the applicant to refute, extenuate or mitigate the government\u2019s case.\nBecause no one has a \u201cright\u201d to a security clearance, an applicant bears a heavy\nburden of persuasion.  A person who has access to classified information enters into a\n6\nfiduciary relationship with the government based on trust and confidence. Therefore, the\ngovernment has a compelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the\nrequisite judgement, reliability and trustworthiness of one who will protect the national\ninterests as his or her own. The \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard\n\n See Egan; Revised Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 2(b).\n7\n4\ncompels resolution of any reasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in\nfavor of the government.7\nAnalysis\nDrug Involvement. \nThe security concern about drug involvement, as expressed in AG \u00b6 24, is that\n\u201c[u]se of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise questions about an\nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because it may impair judgment and\nbecause it raises questions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws,\nrules, and regulations.\u201d The government produced sufficient information, which\nApplicant does not contest, that shows she used marijuana extensively, and other illegal\ndrugs to a lesser extent, for about seven years, starting when she was in college. She\nalso possessed illegal drugs sporadically over those seven years when she purchased\nmarijuana for use with her friends. These facts require application of the disqualifying\nconditions listed at AG \u00b6 25(a) (any drug abuse) and AG \u00b6 25(c) (illegal drug\npossession, including cultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or\ndistribution; or possession of drug paraphernalia).\nIn response, it is likewise uncontested that Applicant has not used or been\ninvolved with illegal drugs since June 2007. Applicant appears to have disclosed the full\nextent of her drug involvement and asserts she will not use drugs in the future. Among\nthe mitigating conditions listed in AG \u00b6 26, I have considered the potential application of\nAG \u00b6 26(a) (the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened under\nsuch circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on the individual's\ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;) and AG \u00b6 26(b) (a demonstrated\nintent not to abuse any drugs in the future, such as: (1) dissociation from drug-using\nassociates and contacts; (2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were\nused; (3) an appropriate period of abstinence; (4) a signed statement of intent with\nautomatic revocation of clearance for any violation;). \nHowever, given Applicant\u2019s extensive history of drug use over most of her adult\nlife to date, it is too soon to safely predict she has eliminated her illegal drug use as a\nsecurity concern. Even accepting that Applicant has discontinued her association with\npersons who use drugs and has changed her circumstances to avoid future drug use,\nher use of marijuana 100 times over the course of 81 months represents a frequency of\nmore than once a month. Accordingly, I conclude her 14-month period of abstinence is\ninsufficient to mitigate the security concerns about her drug use.\nWhole Person Concept. \nI have evaluated the facts presented and have applied the appropriate\nadjudicative factors under Guideline H. I have also reviewed the record before me in the\ncontext of the whole person factors listed in AG \u00b6 2(a). Applicant is 28 years old and\n\n See footnote 4, supra.\n8\n5\npresumed to be a mature, responsible adult. However, most of her adult life so far has\nbeen dominated by her involvement with illegal and unsafe conduct. Despite the\nabsence of arrests or other known problems as a result of her drug use, there is no\navailable information to support any of the AG \u00b6 2(a) factors. A fair and commonsense\nassessment  of the available information bearing on Applicant\u2019s drug use shows she\n8\nhas not yet satisfied the doubts about her ability or willingness to protect the\ngovernment\u2019s interests.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by section\nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Drug Involvement:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the foregoing, it is not clearly consistent with the national interest\nto allow Applicant access to classified information. Request for a security clearance is\ndenied.\n                             \n                                                    \nMATTHEW E. MALONE\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance is granted. \n \nOn July 23, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued to \nApplicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under \nGuideline B. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of \nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative \nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective \nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on August 11, 2008, and requested a \nhearing before an Administrative Judge. The case was assigned to me on September 3, \n2008. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on September 4, 2008, and I convened the \nhearing as scheduled on September 25, 2008. The government offered Exhibits (GE) 1 \nthrough 3, which were admitted without objections.  \n \n1 \n \n \nOctober 15, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \n \n                                                          \nApplicant testified and three witnesses testified on his behalf. He submitted \nExhibits (AE) A through D, which were admitted without objections. The record was held \nopen to allow Applicant an opportunity to submit an English translation of some his \ndocuments. He did so in a timely manner and the additional exhibit was marked as AE \nE and admitted without objection.  \n \nRequest for Administrative Notice and Procedural Issues \n \nDepartment Counsel submitted a formal request that I take administrative notice \nof certain facts relating to Colombia. Applicant did not object and the request was \napproved. The request and the attached documents were not admitted into evidence \nbut were included in the record as Hearing Exhibits (HE). I did not take administrative \nnotice of the facts contained in the memorandum submitted dated September 22, 2008, \nthat was offered as a hearing exhibit. That document was remarked as GE 4 and \nadmitted as a government exhibit. I took administrative notice of the source documents \nfor the facts contained in GE 4 that are contained in HE I though IV. The facts \nadministratively noticed are set out in the Findings of Fact, below.   \n \nDepartment Counsel moved to amend the SOR at the end of the Applicant\u2019s \ncase. The motion was marked as HE V. There being no objection, the motion was \ngranted, and the SOR was amended to include subparagraph 1.h. DOHA received the \ntranscript of the hearing (Tr.) on October 2, 2008.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant admitted all of the allegations in the SOR except \u00b6\u00b6 1.d and 1.e. The \nadmissions to the allegations in the SOR are incorporated herein. In addition, after a \nthorough and careful review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the \nfollowing findings of fact. \n \n \nApplicant is a 43-year-old mechanical engineer who works for a defense \ncontractor. He was born in Colombia and moved to the U.S. in 1996 and has lived here \nsince then. He received his permanent resident alien status in 1998. When he became \neligible to apply for U.S. citizenship he did and became a naturalized U.S. citizen in \n2004. He stated he did not want to return to Colombia, so it was important to him to be a \ncitizen of the U.S. He did not want anything to affect him because his immediate family \nlives in the U.S. He wanted to make sure he had all of the guarantees that a U.S. citizen \nreceived. He obtained a U.S. passport, but maintained his Colombian passport until he \nwas advised that it created a security issue. He no longer has a valid Colombian \npassport. He relinquished his Colombia passport and identification card to his \nemployer\u2019s security office and it was returned to the Colombian embassy. He also \nrenounced his Colombia citizenship through its consulate.1 \n \n \n1 Tr. 51-59, 92-94; AE A and B. \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \n                                                          \n \nAppellant is pursuing a master\u2019s degree in systems engineering. He has voted in \nU.S. elections since becoming a citizen. He married a U.S. citizen in 1998 and has two \nchildren ages ten and seven, both born in the U.S. His wife is a college professor. \nApplicant\u2019s wife is on a sabbatical for six months and is living with their children in \nApplicant\u2019s mother\u2019s house in Colombia. They are using this extended visit so that the \nfamily can be immersed in the Spanish language. Other than Applicant, neither of his \nchildren or his wife speaks Spanish. His wife wanted to learn Spanish and they wanted \nthe children to learn it. They decided the best way to learn it was to live in Colombia for \nseveral months. They have been there since July 2008 and are expected to return in \nNovember 2008. Applicant does not expect their return to be delayed because his \ndaughter has a medical condition that requires care in the U.S. After Applicant married \nhe no longer voted in Colombian elections.2 \n \n \nApplicant and his wife own a home in the U.S. valued at approximately $450,000 \nand have investment assets valued at approximately $40,000. They also expect to \ninherit a 30% interest in a family farm in the U.S. from his wife\u2019s side of the family. \nApplicant earns approximately $75,000 a year and his wife earns approximately \n$60,000. He does not own any property in Colombia. He previously owned a house in \nColombia that was purchased in 1995, but sold it in July 2008.3 He sold it to his mother \nfor a nominal price and his mother in return sold it to his sister, who lives in the U.S.4  \n \n \nApplicant worked in Colombia prior to emigrating to the U.S. and paid into the \nColombian version of their social security system. He estimated that the account he \nmay be entitled to is about $1,000. He credibly testified he does not need the meager \namount of money and is uncertain whether he would be eligible to collect it because he \nis no longer a citizen of Colombia. Even if he is entitled to it he does not expect to apply \nfor it. He does not have any outstanding financial obligations or delinquent debts.5  \n \n \nApplicant has traveled to Colombia four times since he emigrated in 1996. When \nhe returns it is to visit his mother. On one occasion he traveled to a Colombian island in \nthe Caribbean for vacation. On each occasion, except in 2007, he traveled to Colombia \nusing his Colombian passport.6  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s mother and one sister are citizens of Colombia and reside there. His \nfather is deceased and worked as a shoe salesman when he was alive. His mother is \nretired from the food service industry. She has never worked for the Colombian \ngovernment. She owns three houses and uses the rent proceeds as income to live on. \nApplicant does not provide financial support for his mother or sister. His mother does \n \n2 Tr. 59-67, 109-110. \n \n3 Tr. 73-78; AE C. \n \n4 Tr. 67-70, 110-111. \n \n5 Tr. 100-101. \n \n6 Tr. 55, 73, 92-93. \n\n \n4 \n \n \n                                                          \nnot receive a pension from the government. His sister works for a private company \ncoordinating customer service needs. He talks to his mother about once a week and if \nhis sister is present he will talk with her. His sister is married and has two children. Her \nhusband has a small business that sells magazines and distributes them to small \ntowns.7  \n \n \nApplicant has another sister who lives in Argentina. She has lived there two to \nthree years. Applicant has no phone contact with her. He does not know her phone \nnumber. The last time he saw her was three years ago. His contact with her is rare. He \nhad an email from her in January 2008. She is married and her husband works in the \nfishing industry. Applicant did not know any more about his brother-in-law\u2019s \nemployment.8  \n \n \nApplicant has another sister who is a citizen of Colombia, but resides in the U.S. \nShe telephones Applicant and his family frequently. Applicant\u2019s daughter has a serious \nmedical issue, so his sister calls to see how her health is. She lives in the Midwest and \nis employed as a house cleaner. She entered the U.S. with a visa, but Applicant is \nunsure of what her immigration status is.9  \n \n \nWhen Applicant returns to Colombia he meets with four friends he attended \ncollege with. None of them have ever visited him in the U.S. He only visits them when \nhe is in Colombia. He last spoke to them when he visited Colombia a year ago.10  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s supervisor testified that he is a conscientious employee with a good \nwork ethic. He is always on time and works extra hours; he is respectful and well liked. \nApplicant has had access to propriety information and has always followed the proper \nrules and procedures with regard to it.11  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s coworkers also testified on his behalf. He is considered conscientious \nand enthusiastic. He abides by the rules of the company. He is self-motivated and \nprovides quality work. He is believed to be trustworthy.12 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n7 Tr. 77-83, 102-104. \n \n8 Tr. 85-87, 104. \n \n9 Tr. 87-90, 106. \n \n10 Tr. 83-85. \n \n11 Tr. 20-32. \n \n12 Tr. 33-46. \n\n \n5 \n \n \n                                                          \nColombia13 \n \n \nColombia is a constitutional, multiparty democracy and the second most \npopulous country in South America. Any person born in Colombia is considered a \nColombian citizen. There are travel warnings for U.S. citizen by the Department of State \nhighlighting the dangers of violence by narcoterrorist groups and other criminal \nelements in Colombia. Foreigners continue to be victims of threats, kidnappings, and \nother criminal acts and there are severe restrictions on travel to and within Colombia for \nAmericans residing there for official duties. Victims of violence have included journalists, \nmissionaries, scientists, human rights workers, and tourists including children. The \nSecretary of State has designated three Colombian groups as Foreign Terrorist \nOrganizations that have carried out bombings and other attacks. They have also \ntargeted critical infrastructure, public recreation areas and modes of transportation. \nThey have also targeted civilians, government workers, politicians and soldiers. One \nterrorist organization held three U.S. citizen government contractors as hostages for five \nyears. The government of Colombia\u2019s record on human rights has improved, but there \nare still serious problems, including unlawful and extrajudicial killings, forced \ndisappearances, insubordinate military collaboration with criminal groups, torture and \nmistreatment of detainees, and other serious human rights abuses. \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \n13 All of the information was taken from HE I through IV. \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \nAG \u00b6 6 expresses the security concern regarding foreign influence: \u201cForeign \ncontacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual has divided loyalties or \nforeign financial interests, may be manipulated or induced to help a foreign person, \ngroup, organization, or government in a way that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable \nto pressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Adjudication under this Guideline can \nand should consider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or \nfinancial interest is located, including, but not limited to, such considerations as whether \nthe foreign country is known to target United States citizens to obtain protected \ninformation and/or is associated with a risk of terrorism.\u201d \nAG \u00b6 7 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. I have especially considered (a) (\u201ccontact with a foreign family member, \nbusiness or professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident \nin a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, \ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion\u201d); (b) (\u201cconnections to a foreign person, \ngroup, government, or country that create a potential conflict of interest between the \nindividual \u2018s obligation to protect sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s \ndesires to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing that information\u201d) and \n(e) (\u201ca substantial business, financial, or property interest in a foreign country, or in any \nforeign-owned or foreign-operated business, which could subject the individual to \n\n \n7 \n \n \nheightened risk of foreign influence or exploitation\u201d). Applicant\u2019s mother and three \nsisters are citizens of Colombia. His mother resides in Colombia, as does one sister. His \nother sister lives in Argentina and the remaining sister is in the U.S. He also has friends \nin Colombia that he visits when he is there. He no longer owns property in Colombia. He \nhas a retirement interest in Colombia\u2019s social security system. He travels to Colombia to \nvisit his mother. I find (a) and (b) apply. Applicant has a $1,000 retirement interest in \nColombia. Based on his total financial assets, I find this is not a substantial financial \ninterest and therefore not disqualifying. In the event it was determined to be a \nsubstantial financial interest, I have addressed it below. \nAG \u00b6 8 describes conditions that could mitigate the security concerns raised. I \nhave considered all of them and especially considered (a) (\u201cthe nature of the \nrelationships with foreign persons, the country in which these person are located, or the \npositions or activities of those person in that country are such that it is unlikely the \nindividual will be placed in a position of having to choose between the interests of a \nforeign individual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the U.S.\u201d); (b) \n(\u201cthere is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of loyalty or \nobligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country is so minimal, or the \nindividual has such deep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in the U.S., that \nthe individual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. \ninterests\u201d); (c) (\u201ccontact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual or infrequent \nthat there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign influence or \nexploitation\u201d) and (f) (\u201cthe value or routine nature of the foreign business, financial, or \nproperty interests is such that they are unlikely to result in a conflict and could not be \nused effectively to influence, manipulate, or pressure the individual\u201d).  \n \nApplicant\u2019s mother is retired and has her own means of support. She is not \nreliant on the government for subsistence. One sister lives in Colombia, one in the U.S. \nand another in Argentina. Applicant no longer owns property in Colombia and his \nretirement interests are minimal. Applicant\u2019s has a firm and solid footprint in the U.S. \nHis wife was born here, as were his children. His daughter receives important medical \ncare in the U.S. They own a house and have an inheritance interest in a farm. His wife \nis a professor at a university. He has lived in the U.S. since 1996. His career, livelihood \nand family are rooted in the U.S. His attachment to Colombia is primarily his mother, \nalthough he has some college friends he sees when there. Colombia\u2019s human rights \nrecord has problems, but there is no evidence that the government targets its citizens \nor former citizens to gain information of a classified or sensitive nature. I find his family \nis unlikely to be placed in a position where Applicant would have to make a choice \nbetween their interests and those of the U.S. Applicant is firmly established in the U.S. \nand even if there was a conflict Applicant\u2019s can be expected to resolve any conflict in \nfavor of the U.S.  \n \nI do not find that because his family is living in Colombia during his wife\u2019s \nsabbatical so they can learn Spanish, that this in any way undermines his loyalty to the \nU.S. It is clear this was a unique opportunity for them and does not raise a question of \nApplicant\u2019s commitment to the U.S. Applicant was quite adamant about their return due \n\n \n8 \n \n \nto his daughter\u2019s medical condition, which is another factor when considering his sense \nof obligation to the U.S. Therefore, I find (a) and (b) apply. \n \nApplicant has regular contact with his mother and sister in Colombia, and his \nsister who lives in the U.S. He has minimal contact with his sister in Argentina. He also \nhas contact with friends in Colombia. I find (c) does not apply.  \n \n \nI have considered Applicant\u2019s financial interests in Colombia and determined \nthey are not substantial. At this juncture, Applicant does not know whether he would be \nentitled to apply for a retirement payment, due to his U.S. citizenship. He credibly \ntestified that he has abandoned his rights to this account, even if he was entitled. Other \nthan this account, all of his financial interests are in the U.S. It is unlikely that a meager, \nspeculative, retirement interest would result in a conflict or could be used to effectively \ninfluence, manipulate, or pressure Applicant. I find (f) applies.  \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness \nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation \nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent \nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant\u2019s mother, sister, and some \nfriends are citizens of and residents in Colombia. His other two sisters are both citizens \nof Colombia, but do not live there. There are significant factors supporting approval of \nApplicant\u2019s access to classified information. He has lived in the U.S since 1996 and is a \nnaturalized citizen. His wife and children are citizens. All of his financial assets are in \nthe U.S., except a nominal speculative retirement account in Colombia. His wife is a \ncollege professor employed in the U.S. He does not own any property in Colombia. \nApplicant and his wife expect to inherit part of her family\u2019s farm. Applicant has a secure \njob and a good reputation. There is no evidence that Colombia targets its citizens or \nformer citizens to obtain classified or sensitive information, although there is evidence \nthat there are human rights problems and narcoterrorism. I have considered all of the \nfactors raised and conclude that the record evidence leaves me without questions or \ndoubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these \n\n \n9 \n \n \nreasons, I conclude Applicant mitigated the security concerns arising from foreign \ninfluence.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a-1.h: \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

On November 10, 2008, the\nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR)\ndetailing the security concerns under Guidelines J and G concerning the Applicant.  The\naction was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information\nwithin Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive\n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2,\n1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG)\npromulgated by President Bush on December 29, 2005, and effective within the\nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant submitted an Answer to the SOR on December 3, 2008, and requested\na hearing before an Administrative Judge.  Department Counsel was prepared to\nproceed on December 14, 2008.  I received the case assignment on December 16,\n2008.  DOHA issued a notices of hearing on December 16, 2008, and January 15,\n2009.  I convened the hearing as scheduled on January 16, 2009.  The Government\n\n2\noffered Government Exhibits 1 and 2, which were received without objection. Applicant\ntestified on his own behalf and submitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibits A and B, without\nobjection.  The Applicant requested that the record remain open and, on January 30,\n2009, he submitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibits C and D, which were also admitted without\nobjection.  DOHA received the transcript of the hearing on January 29, 2009.  The\nrecord closed on January 30, 2009.  Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings,\nexhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified information is granted.\nFindings of Fact\nThe Applicant is 43 and married.  He is employed by a defense contractor and\nseeks to retain a security clearance previously granted in connection with his\nemployment.\nGuideline J \u2013 Criminal Conduct\nGuideline G - Alcohol Consumption\nThe Government alleges under Guideline J that the Applicant is ineligible for\nclearance because he has engaged in criminal acts.  The Government further alleges\nunder Guideline G that the Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he uses\nintoxicants to excess.  The Applicant admitted the factual allegations in subparagraphs\n1.a., 1.b. and 2.b. of the SOR.  Those admissions are hereby deemed findings of fact.\nHe denied subparagraph 2.a.  \nThe Applicant has had two alcohol related incidents - in 2007 and 2008.  The\nApplicant was cited in July 2007 for Possession of Alcoholic Beverage in County Park.\nHe received a fine for this incident.  (Transcript at 26-30.)\nThe Applicant\u2019s second alcohol related incident happened in May 2008.  On that\noccasion, the Applicant went to a bar with some friends after playing softball.  He had\nbeen drinking beer earlier, as well as taking cold medicine.  The Applicant drank more\nbeer at the bar, but waited for what he felt was a sufficient time before driving home.\nThe Applicant was subsequently arrested for Driving Under the Influence of Alcohol.\nThe Applicant pleaded guilty to a reduced charge of Reckless Driving and was\nsentenced to pay a fine, receive alcohol assessments and complete alcohol education\nclasses, pay fees or serve 13 days in jail, and he was placed on three years probation.\nHe successfully completed the alcohol education classes.  The Applicant has stated that\nthis was an unusual situation and that he is not an irresponsible person.  (Government\nExhibit 2 at 8-12; Applicant\u2019s Exhibit B; Transcript at 37-46, 51-53.)\nThe Applicant testified that he is a moderate drinker, and that this incident\nchanged his life.  He further testified that his family, including his wife and children, has\nbeen very supportive of him.  The Applicant has not consumed alcohol since November\n2008, and he never drank to excess on a regular basis.  (Transcript at 48-51, 53-54.)\n\n3\nThe Applicant recently went to his company\u2019s Employee Assistance Program\nbecause, \u201cI wanted to find out if there was something wrong.\u201d  (Transcript at 47.)\nPeople at the Program recommended that the Applicant receive an alcohol assessment\nand, if it was determined that there was a problem, that he admit himself to a treatment\nprogram.  The Applicant agreed and had the assessment.  After the assessment, a\nprimary counselor wrote, \u201cPer our face-to-face assessment at . . . Center for Chemical\nDependency on January 7, 2009, you do not meet the criteria for abuse or dependence\nto alcohol.  Therefore, you do not meet the criteria for admission to Intensive Outpatient\nTreatment.\u201d  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit A.)\nMitigation\nFriends and family members submitted letters on the Applicant\u2019s behalf.   In them\nhe is described as being \u201chelpful,\u201d \u201ckind,\u201d \u201cloving,\u201d and \u201cdedicated.\u201d (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit\nC.)   \nWork associates and supervisors also submitted letters on the Applicant\u2019s behalf.\nThe Applicant is a Team Lead at his job, and is viewed as a subject matter expert and\nexpert leader.  He is described as someone who has \u201cmorals,\u201d is \u201cdependable,\u201d\n\u201ctrustworthy,\u201d and \u201can asset.\u201d  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit D.) \nPolicies\nSecurity clearance decisions are not made in a vacuum.  When evaluating an\nApplicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the Administrative Judge must consider\nthe revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief introductory explanations for\neach guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and\nmitigating conditions, which are useful in evaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access\nto classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.  In addition, the Administrative Judge may also rely on his own\ncommon sense, as well as his knowledge of the law, human nature, and the ways of the\nworld, in making a reasoned decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\n\n4\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Security clearance decisions include, by\nnecessity, consideration of the possible risk that the Applicant may deliberately or\ninadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a\ncertain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk\nof compromise of classified information.\n \nFinally, as emphasized by President Eisenhower in Section 7 of Executive Order\n10865, \u201cAny determination under this order . . . shall be a determination in terms of the\nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline J \u2013 Criminal Conduct\nGuideline G - Alcohol Consumption\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Criminal Conduct is set out in\nAG \u00b6 30:\nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment,\nreliability, and trustworthiness.  By its very nature, it calls into question a\nperson\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations.\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Alcohol Consumption is set out\nin AG \u00b6 21:      \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of\nquestionable judgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness.\n\n5\nThe Applicant was involved in two alcohol related incidents in 2007 and 2008.\nThe Applicant has used alcohol from about 1985 until November 2008.  He intends to\nconsume alcohol in the future, but not to excess and at a very low rate.\nUnder the Criminal Conduct guideline, the following Disqualifying Conditions are\napplicable.  AG \u00b6 31.(a) \u201cA single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses.\u201d  AG \u00b6\n31.(d) \u201cIndividual is currently on parole or probation.\u201d\nAfter considering the evidence in the record, I find that the following Mitigating\nConditions also apply to this case.  Under AG \u00b6 32.(a), \u201cSo much time has elapsed\nsince the criminal behavior happened, or it happened under such unusual\ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s\nreliability, trustworthiness or good judgment.\u201d  In addition, AG \u00b6 32.(d) states, \u201cThere is\nevidence of successful rehabilitation, including but not limited to the passage of time\nwithout recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or restitution, job training or higher\neducation, good employment record, or constructive community involvement.\u201d\nThere is one Disqualifying Condition concerning Alcohol Consumption that\narguably applies to this case.  AG \u00b6 22.(a) \u201cAlcohol-related incidents away from work,\nsuch as driving while under the influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the\npeace, or other incidents of concern, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed\nas an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent.\u201d  \nUnder the particular facts of this case, the following mitigating condition clearly\napplies to the Applicant\u2019s situation. AG \u00b6 23.(a) states that it can be a mitigating\ncondition when, \u201cSo much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it\nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast\ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness or good judgment.\u201d\nWhen viewed in the light least favorable to the Applicant, he has had two alcohol\nrelated incidents in the past three years.  Only one of those incidents involved drinking\nand driving.  While this is certainly nothing to be taken lightly, there is, in my opinion, no\nevidence of a pattern of abuse here.  His last incident occurred a year and a half before\nthe record closed.  I have considered the fact that he is still on probation, as well as his\nobtaining an alcohol evaluation which states that he is not an alcohol abuser or alcohol\ndependent.  The evidence is clear that the drinking and driving offense was an\naberration, out of character and will not be repeated.  The Applicant has mitigated the\nsecurity significance of these incidents.  \nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances.  The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\n\n6\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation\nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent\nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.\n       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case.  The Applicant is a hard-working,\nrespected, professional person who has had two alcohol related incidents in the last\nthree years.  There is little to no evidence that these incidents show a pattern, or that he\nis alcohol dependent or an alcohol abuser.  In viewing all the facts of this case, I find\nthat the Applicant has mitigated the security significance of his prior conduct.  As set\nforth at length above, I find that the that there have been permanent behavioral changes\nunder AG \u00b6 2(a)(6); and that the likelihood of continuation or recurrence is close to nil\n(AG \u00b6 2(a)(9). \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with no questions and/or doubts as to\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I\nconclude the Applicant has mitigated the security concerns arising from his alcohol\nrelated incidents, and the related criminal conduct.  \nOn balance, it is concluded that the Applicant has successfully overcome the\nGovernment's case opposing his request for a DoD security clearance.  Accordingly, the\nevidence supports a finding for the Applicant as to the factual and conclusionary\nallegations expressed in Paragraphs 1 and 2 of the Government's Statement of\nReasons. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline J:\nFOR THE APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor the Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline G:\nFOR THE APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nFor the Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b:\nFor the Applicant \n\n7\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.\n                                              \nWILFORD H. ROSS\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\n\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On June 26, 2008, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the\nbasis for that decision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline B (Foreign Influence) of\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant\nrequested a hearing.  On December 8, 2008, after the hearing, Administrative Judge Darlene Lokey\nAnderson denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant timely appealed pursuant\nto the Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s adverse security\nclearance decision under Guideline B is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.\nApplicant argues that the Judge\u2019s adverse security clearance decision is unsupported by the\nrecord as a whole.  Applicant\u2019s argument does not demonstrate that the Judge\u2019s decision is arbitrary,\ncapricious or contrary to law.\nApplicant points out that the Judge found that her parents are citizens and residents of the\nPeople\u2019s Republic of China (China), when in fact there is record evidence that they have permanent\nresident status in the U.S.  However, as of the close of the record they were residing temporarily in\nChina for medical purposes.  Therefore, any error in this finding is harmless.\nApplicant also describes her relationship with her brother as \u201cestranged.\u201d  However, as the\nJudge notes in her decision, Applicant sees her brother when she visits China, sends him birthday\ncards, and brings gifts of toys and clothes to her brother\u2019s son on her visits.  Decision at 7.\nTherefore, Applicant has not undermined the Judge\u2019s conclusions as to her brother.\n \nOnce the government presents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the\napplicant to establish mitigation.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  The presence of some mitigating evidence\ndoes not alone compel the Judge to make a favorable clearance decision.  As the trier of fact, the\nJudge has to weigh the evidence as a whole and decide whether the favorable evidence outweighs\nthe unfavorable evidence, or vice versa.  An applicant\u2019s disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of\nthe evidence, or an ability to argue for a different interpretation of the evidence, is not sufficient to\ndemonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence or reached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 07-05632 at 2 (App. Bd. May 13, 2008).\nA review of the record indicates that the Judge weighed the mitigating evidence offered by\nApplicant against the seriousness of the disqualifying circumstances and considered the possible\napplication of relevant conditions and factors.  She reasonably explained why the evidence which\nthe Applicant had presented in mitigation was insufficient to overcome the government\u2019s security\nconcerns.  The Board does not review a case de novo.  The favorable record evidence cited by\nApplicant is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge\u2019s decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary\nto law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-11172 at 3 (App. Bd. Sep. 4, 2007).  The Judge examined the\nrelevant data and articulated a satisfactory explanation for her decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational\nconnection between the facts found and the choice made.\u2019\u201d Motor Vehicle Mfrs.

Goldstein, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: B. Daniel Lynch, Attorney At Law\nDecember 8, 2008 \n______________\nDecision\n______________\nLOKEY ANDERSON, Darlene D., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted her Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations Processing\n(e-QIP), on September 27, 2006.  On June 26, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings\nand Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security\nconcerns under Guidelines B for Applicant. The action was taken under Executive Order\n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as\namended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel\nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and\nthe revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29,\n2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September\n1, 2006. \n \nThe Applicant responded to the SOR on August 19, 2008, and she requested a\nhearing before a DOHA Administrative Judge.  This case was assigned to the\nundersigned on September 12, 2008.  A notice of hearing was issued on September 23,\n2008, scheduling the hearing for November 5, 2008.  At the hearing the Government\npresented two exhibits, referred to as Government Exhibits 1 and 2.  The Applicant\ncalled two witnesses, and  presented ten exhibits, referred to as Applicant\u2019s Exhibits A\nthrough J.  Applicant also testified on her own behalf.  Applicant\u2019s Exhibits A through E\nwere marked for identification purposes only and not admitted into evidence.  The\nrecord was left open to allow the Applicant to submit documentation to verify that\n\n2\nExhibits A through E, which were originally in Chinese and translated into English, were\nin fact translated by a licensed and certified court translator.  Applicant\u2019s submitted two\npost-hearing exhibits, referred to as Applicant\u2019s Post-Hearing Exhibits A and B.\nApplicant\u2019s Exhibit A is an affidavit that verifies that Applicant\u2019s Exhibits A through E\nwere translated by a duly licensed and certified court translator.  Accordingly,\nApplicant\u2019s Exhibits A through E were admitted into evidence.  The official transcript\n(Tr.) was received on November 17, 2008.  Based upon a review of the case file,\npleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified information is\ndenied.\nRequest for Administrative Notice\nDepartment Counsel requested that I take administrative notice of certain facts\nconcerning the current political conditions in the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC).\nApplicant had no objection.  (Tr. p. 6).  The request and the attached documents were\nnot admitted into evidence but were included in the record. The facts administratively\nnoticed are set out in the Findings of Fact, below. \nFINDINGS OF FACT\nThe following Findings of Fact are based on Applicant's Answer to the SOR, the\ntestimony and the exhibits.  The Applicant is 45 years of age and has a Doctorate\nDegree of Philosophy in Electrical Engineering.  She is employed as an Engineering\nSpecialist for a defense contractor.  She seeks a security clearance in connection with\nher employment in the defense industry.\nParagraph 1 (Guideline B - Foreign Influence).  The Government alleges in this\nparagraph that the Applicant is ineligible for clearance because she has foreign contacts\nthat could create the potential for foreign influence that could result in the compromise\nof classified information.\n The Applicant admitted all of the allegations set forth in the\nSOR under this guideline.\nThe Applicant was born in Shanghai, China in 1963, to Chinese parents.  She\ncame to the United States in 1987, to pursue higher education.  She obtained a Masters\nDegree in Mathematics and then a Ph.D in Electrical Engineering.  She started working\nfor a defense contractor in 1997.  She became a naturalized United States citizen in\nJuly 2000.  She began working for her current employer in May 2006.  She understands\nEnglish and Chinese.    \nThe Applicant\u2019s elderly mother and father and 50 year old brother, are citizens\nand residents of China.  Her mother, who is 85 years old, is a retired librarian.  Her\nfather, who is 83 years old, is a retired University professor.  They live in and own a\nsmall apartment in China built by the University for the University faculty.  Until 2001,\nher father was also a member of the Communist party.  (Tr. p. 109).  Her brother, with\nwhom she claims she is estranged, is a retired Electrical Technician.  She admits to\nsending him a birthday card.  His wife works in the garment industry.  \n\n3\nThe Applicant is very close to her parents.  She applied for permanent resident\nstatus for them in 2003, and they received their green cards in 2004.  (Applicant\u2019s\nExhibit G).  In addition to a small pension her parents receive, from 1997 to 2006, the\nApplicant financially supported her parents.  She recently sent $1,000.00 to her parents\nin order for them to purchase medicine.  She contacts them by telephone at least once\na week.  Applicant\u2019s mother, who is now sick with what maybe cancer, is currently being\ntreated in China with traditional Chinese herbal medicine.  Since returning to China her\nmother\u2019s health condition has improved.  Her parents plan on returning to the United\nStates in December or January, and in June 2009, upon eligibility, plan to apply for\nUnited States citizenship. (Tr. p. 76).  Upon their return, they plan to live with the\nApplicant and she will provide their financial support.    \nThe Applicant owns a condominium in Shanghai, China valued at approximately\n$250,000.00.  The condo is currently in escrow and if all things go as planned, should\nbe sold in February 2009.  If not, it will remain on the market for sale.  She also\nmaintains a bank account in China that is used to distribute funds from her tenants rent\nto pay the mortgage on the condo.  The Applicant earns approximately $700.00 to\n$800.00 per month in rental income from the condo.  She also maintains a checking\naccount at a bank in China that currently has a balance of approximately $6,000.00.\nOnce the condo is sold, the Applicant will not longer have any financial assets in China.\n(Applicant\u2019s Exhibits A, B, C, D, and E).\nSince February 1997, the Applicant has traveled to China on at least six different\noccasions.  Since becoming a United States citizen, she had traveled to China using her\nAmerican passport.  She has torn up her Chinese passport.  (Applicant Exhibit F).  On\neach occasion, she visited her parents and stayed at their home in Shanghai.  She also\nsaw her brother during those visits.  \nIn 2007, the Applicant purchased a townhouse in the United States for\n$530,000.00.  Her bank account balances equal approximately $200,000.00 and each\nmonth she contributes to a 401(k) offered by her employer.\nThe Applicant\u2019s Director and Section Manager testified that the requirements of\nher job are very difficult to fill and that she is exceptionally reliable and trustworthy and\nan excellent employee.  They both recommend her for a position of trust.  (Tr. p. 45 -54\nand 57- 64).  \nLetters of recommendation from the Applicant\u2019s professional colleagues,\nincluding the Director of the Department, the Section Manager, and other co-workers\nwho have known the Applicant since she began her employment in the defense\nindustry, describe her as honest, a person of good character, high integrity, diligence,\nstraight forwardness, discreet, with hard working habits.  She has superior skills in her\nfield of expertise and is considered reliable and trustworthy both personally and\nprofessionally. (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit I).    \nApplicant received an award from her company in recognition of her outstanding\ncontribution.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit H).\n\n4\nI have taken official notice of the following facts concerning the People\u2019s Republic\nof China (PRC).  The People's Republic of China is a Communist country and its\npolitics, society and human rights records remain inconsistent with United States\nsystem of democracy and freedom.  It is the most populous country in the world, is\neconomically powerful, and is an important trading partner of the United States.  It has\nstrong military forces, and has its own foreign-policy.  The United States is a primary\nintelligence target of China because of its role as a global superpower; its substantial\nmilitary, political, and economic presence in the Pacific Rim and Asia; its role as a\ndeveloper of advanced technology that China requires for economic growth and the\nlarge number of Americans of Chinese ancestry, who are considered prime intelligence\ntargets by the PRC.  The PRC engages in espionage against the United States through\nan extensive network of businesses, personnel, and specific programs designed to\nacquire advanced U.S. military technology.  One approach is to covertly conduct\nespionage by personnel from government ministries, commissions, institutes, and\nmilitary industries, independently of the PRC intelligence services.  This is believed to\nbe the major method of PRC intelligence activity in the United States.  It also tries to\nidentify ethnic Chinese in the United States who have access to sensitive information,\nand sometimes is able to enlist their cooperation in illegal technology information\ntransfers.\nPOLICIES\nSecurity clearance decisions are not made in a vacuum.  Accordingly, the\nDepartment of Defense, in Enclosure 2 of the 1992  Directive sets forth policy factors\nand conditions that could raise or mitigate a security concern; which must be given\nbinding consideration in making security clearance determinations.  These factors\nshould be followed in every case according to the pertinent criterion.  However, the\nconditions are neither automatically determinative of the decision in any case, nor can\nthey supersede the Administrative Judge\u2019s reliance on her own common sense.\nBecause each security clearance case presents its own unique facts and\ncircumstances, it cannot be assumed that these factors exhaust the realm of human\nexperience, or apply equally in every  case.  Based on the Findings of Fact set forth\nabove, the factors most applicable to the evaluation of this case are:\nForeign Influence\n6.  The Concern.  Foreign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the\nindividual has divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or\ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way that is not\nin U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by any foreign interest.\nAdjudication under this Guideline can and should consider the identity of the foreign\ncountry in which the foreign contact or financial interest is located, including, but not\nlimited to, such considerations as whether the foreign country is known to target United\nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a risk of\nterrorism. \n\n5\nConditions that could raise a security concern:\n7.  (a) contact with a foreign family member, business or professional associate,\nfriend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident of a foreign country if that contact\ncreates a heightened risks of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure,\nor coercion; \n7.  (d) sharing living quarters with a persons, regardless of citizenship status, if\nthat relationship creates a heightened risk of foreign inducement, manipulation,\npressure, or coercion;\n7.  (e) a substantial business, financial, or property interest in a foreign country,\nor in any foreign-owned or foreign-operated business, which could subject the individual\nto heightened risk of foreign influence or exploitation.\nConditions that could mitigate security concerns:\nNone.\nIn addition, as set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive at pages 16-17, in\nevaluating the relevance of an individual\u2019s conduct, the Administrative Judge should\nconsider the following general factors:\na.  The nature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding circumstances\nb.  The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation\n \nc.  The frequency and recency of the conduct\nd.  The individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct\ne.  The voluntariness of participation\nf.  The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavior\nchanges\ng.  The motivation for the conduct \nh. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress\n \ni.  The likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nThe eligibility criteria established in the DoD Directive identify personal\ncharacteristics and conduct which are reasonably related to the ultimate question,\nposed in Section 2 of Executive Order 10865, of whether it is \u201cclearly consistent with the\nnational interest\u201d to grant an Applicant\u2019s request for access to classified information.\n\n6\nThe DoD Directive states, \u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a\nsufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the person is\neligible for a security clearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is\npredicted upon the individual meeting these personnel security guidelines.  The\nadjudicative process is the careful weighing of a number of variables known as the\nwhole person concept.  Available, reliable information about the person, past and\npresent, favorable and unfavorable should be considered in reaching a determination. \nThe Administrative Judge can draw only those inferences or conclusions that have\nreasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record.  The Judge cannot draw\ninferences or conclusions based on evidence which is speculative or conjectural in\nnature.  Finally, as emphasized by President Eisenhower in Executive Order 10865,\n\u201cAny determination under this order . . . shall be a determination in terms of the national\ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the Applicant\nconcerned.\u201d\nThe Government must make out a case under Guideline B (foreign influence)\nthat establishes doubt about a person's judgment, reliability and trustworthiness.  While\na rational connection, or nexus, must be shown between Applicant's adverse conduct\nand his ability to effectively safeguard classified information, with respect to sufficiency\nof proof of a rational connection, objective or direct evidence is not required.\nThen, the Applicant must remove that doubt with substantial evidence in\nrefutation, explanation, mitigation or extenuation, which demonstrates that the past\nadverse conduct, is unlikely to be repeated, and that the Applicant presently qualifies for\na security clearance.\nAn individual who demonstrates a foreign influence and has foreign connections\nmay be prone to provide information or make decisions that are harmful to the interests\nof the United States.  The mere possession of a foreign passport raises legitimate\nquestions as to whether the Applicant can be counted upon to place the interests of the\nUnited States paramount to that of another nation. The Government must be able to\nplace a high degree of confidence in a security clearance holder to abide by all security\nrules and regulations, at all times and in all places.\nCONCLUSIONS\nHaving considered the evidence of record in light of the appropriate legal\nstandards and factors, and having assessed the Applicant's credibility based on the\nrecord, this Administrative Judge concludes that the Government has established its\ncase as to all allegations in the SOR.   \nUnder Foreign Influence, Disqualifying Conditions 7(a) contact with a foreign\nfamily member, business or professional associate, friend, or other person who is a\ncitizen of or resident of a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risks of\nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; 7(d) sharing living\nquarters with a persons, regardless of citizenship status, if that relationship creates a\nheightened risk of foreign inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; 7(e) a\nsubstantial business, financial, or property interest in a foreign country, or in any\n\n7\nforeign-owned or foreign-operated business, which could subject the individual to\nheightened risk of foreign influence or exploitation apply.  None of the mitigating\nconditions are applicable.  \nIt appears that the Applicant\u2019s financial holdings in China, specifically her condo\nand bank accounts, are presently in escrow, and will soon be a moot issue.  Therefore I\ndo not see them as a security risk.  I have also considered all of the favorable evidence,\nincluding the testimony, character references and accomplishments of the Applicant. \nHowever, the Applicant\u2019s foreign contacts pose a security risk.  Her mother and\nfather are citizens and residents of China, and the Applicant is very close to them.  Her\nparents currently live in China, and travel back and forth between China and the United\nStates.  When they are in the United States, they live with the Applicant.  When they are\nin China, she contacts them by telephone on a regular basis.  She also provides\nfinancial support for them when they need it.  There is clear evidence of a close bond\nand strong and deep affection.  Although the Applicant does not consider herself to be\nclose to her brother in China, she sees him when she visits China and sends him\nbirthday cards.  She also brings gifts of toys and clothes to her brother\u2019s son, her\nnephew, when she visits.    \nIt is also noted that the current political situation in China elevates the cause for\nconcern in this case.  The evidence shows that the Applicant has a strong bond and\naffection with her parents and to a lesser extent, her brother, and nephew in China.\nUnder the particular circumstances of this case, these foreign relationships could\npotentially cause the Applicant to become subject to foreign exploitation, inducement,\nmanipulation, pressure, or coercion.  Therefore there is a possibility of foreign influence\nthat exists that could create the potential for conduct resulting in the compromise of\nclassified information.  I find that the Applicant is vulnerable to foreign influence.\nAccordingly, I find against the Applicant under Guideline B (Foreign Influence).\nConsidering all the evidence, the Applicant has not met the mitigating conditions\nof Guideline B of the adjudicative guidelines set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive.\nAccordingly, she has not met her ultimate burden of persuasion under Guideline B.  \nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal Findings For or Against the Applicant on the allegations in the SOR, as\nrequired by Paragraph 25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive are:\nParagraph 1: Against the Applicant.\nSubparas.\n1.a.: Against the Applicant\nSubparas.\n1.b.: Against the Applicant\nSubparas.\n1.c.: Against the Applicant\nSubparas.\n1.d.: Against the Applicant\nSubparas.\n1.e.: Against the Applicant\n\n8\nSubparas.\n1.f.:  Against the Applicant\nSubparas.\n1.g.: Against the Applicant\nSubparas.\n1.h.: Against the Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly\nconsistent with the national interests to grant or continue a security clearance for the\nApplicant.\nDarlene Lokey Anderson\nAdministrative Judge\n \n",

Nagel, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: B. Daniel Lynch, Esquire\nDecember 1, 2008\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nMOGUL, Martin H., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted his Security Clearance Application (SF 86), on February 3,\n2006. On June 30, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under Guidelines B and C\nfor Applicant. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative\nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective\nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant replied to the SOR (RSOR) in writing on July 23, 2008, and requested\na hearing before an Administrative Judge. I received the case assignment on August\n11, 2008.  DOHA issued a notice of hearing on September 16, 2008, and I convened\nthe hearing as scheduled on October 20, 2008. The Government offered Exhibits 1\nthrough 3, which were received without objection. Applicant testified on his own behalf\nand through counsel, he also submitted Exhibits A through E, which were admitted\nwithout objection. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr) on October 30, 2008.\n\n2\nBased upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for\naccess to classified information is denied.\nRequest for Administrative Notice\nDepartment Counsel submitted a formal request that I take administrative notice\nof certain facts relating to the country of Iran. The request and the attached documents\nwere admitted into evidence as Exhibit 3. Applicant\u2019s counsel also submitted a request\nthat I take administrative notice (Exhibit D). The facts administratively noticed are set\nout in the Findings of Fact, below. \nFindings of Fact\nIn his RSOR, Applicant admitted SOR allegations 1.a. through 1.i., with\nexplanations, with the exception of 1.e., which he denied. He also admitted 2.a. through\n2.d. The admitted allegations are incorporated herein as findings of fact. \nAfter a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, including\nApplicant's RSOR, the admitted documents, the testimony of Applicant, and upon due\nconsideration of that evidence, I make the additional findings of fact: \nApplicant is 62 years old and was born in Iran in 1946. He moved to the United\nStates in 1969. He moved back to Iran from 1975 to 1979, and he has lived in the U.S.\nsince 1979.  He became a naturalized United States citizen in 1994.  Applicant received\na Master of Science degree in 1971, and a Ph.D. degree in 1975 from a United States\nuniversity. He also received his Bachelor\u2019s Degree from a U.S. university in Iran.\nApplicant has received 32 United States patents for projects that he has worked on in\nthis country. \nApplicant is employed by a defense contractor, and he seeks a DoD security\nclearance in connection with his employment in the defense sector.\nParagraph 1 (Guideline B - Foreign Influence) \n1.a. Applicant's stepfather is a citizen and resident of Iran. Applicant testified that\nhis stepfather and he are very close with a very strong bond, as his biological father\ndied when he was very young, and his stepfather came into his life when Applicant was\neight.  Applicant  described him as more like a father than a stepfather. His stepfather is\nlong retired, but previously he had been a businessman, and before the revolution in\nIran, he was a postal clerk.  \n1.b. Applicant's sister is a citizen and resident of Iran. She is now retired, but she\nhad been a school teacher. Her husband is a veterinarian. Applicant\u2019s relationship with\nhis sister as close. \n1.c. Applicant's half-sister is a citizen of Iran, residing in Germany. She is a\nhousewife.\n\n3\n1.d. Applicant's other half-sister is a citizen and resident of Iran. She is also now\nretired, but she had been a school teacher. Her husband owns a store in Iran. Applicant\nalso has strong bonds of affection to his half sisters. \n1.e. Applicant's father-in-law is a citizen and resident of Iran. Applicant testified\nthat his father-in-law is now deceased. \n1.f. Applicant's sister-in-law is a dual citizen of Iran and Canada, residing in\nCanada. \n1.g. Applicant's brother-in-law is a citizen and resident of Iran. \n1.h. Applicant's wife is a dual citizen of Iran and the United States, residing in the\nUnited States. She works as a nurse.\n1.i. Applicant's daughter and two sons are dual citizens of Iran and the United\nStates, residing in the United States. They are dual citizens, because both of their\nparents are dual citizens. \nParagraph 2 (Guideline C - Foreign Preference) \n1.a. After Applicant became a United States citizen on October 7, 1994, he\nrenewed his Iranian passport, on more than one occasion, the most recent being\nFebruary 5, 2007. He testified that he has used his Iranian passport to enter and exit\nIran, because he is not sure what would happen if he used his U.S. passport. \n1.b. Applicant currently possesses an Iranian passport that is not scheduled to\nexpire until February 5, 2012. He plans to retain his Iranian passport until such time in\nthe future when he does not feel that he needs it any longer. \n1.c. Applicant has used his Iranian passport, rather than a United States\npassport,  to travel to Iran on more than one occasion, after he became a United States\ncitizen. Applicant has traveled to Iran in 1998, 1999, three times in 2003, three times in\n2006, and once in 2008. For all these trips he used his Iranian passport (Exhibit 2).\nApplicant\u2019s wife and children also have current Iranian passports that they have used to\nenter and exit Iran. \n1.d. After Applicant became a United States citizen on October 7, 1994, he voted\nin the 1997 Iranian presidential election. Applicant testified that he voted because the\nperson running for president was more of a moderate, and Applicant believed it would\nbe good for the world if he were elected. He has not voted in any other Iranian election. \nApplicant also testified that at this time he has no intention to renounce his\nIranian citizenship. When his stepfather is deceased he may then consider renouncing\nhis citizenship and revoking his Iranian passport, but not before then. \n\n4\nApplicant estimated that his net value in the United States is approximately $1\nmillion. He submitted four letters of recommendation that described Applicant in very\npositive terms (Exhibit A).  He also submitted many impressive awards, degrees and\ncertificates that have been received by Applicant (Exhibit C).\nCurrent Status of Iran\nI take administrative notice of the following facts regarding Iran. Currently, Iran is\nconsidered one of the most dangerous adversaries to the interests of the United States.\nThe U.S. has not had diplomatic relations with Iran since April 7, 1980, following the\nNovember 1979 Iranian student occupation of the American Embassy in Tehran and the\nhostage taking of 52 Americans, which was supported by Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini,\nIran\u2019s leader at the time.\nThe United States Government\u2019s concerns with Iran\u2019s policies include, but are\nnot limited to the following: (1) its clandestine efforts to acquire nuclear weapons of\nmass destruction, (2) its sponsorship of international terrorism, (3) its intervention into\nthe internal affairs of Iraq, (4) its aggressive efforts to undermine the Middle East peace\nprocess, and (5) its human rights violation against its own people. As a result of these\nconcerns, the U.S. prohibits most trade with Iran.\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\n\n5\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline B, Foreign Influence\nAG \u00b6 6 expresses the security concern regarding foreign influence:\nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual\nhas divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or\ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a\nway that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by\nany foreign interest. Adjudication under this Guideline can and should\nconsider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or\nfinancial interest is located, including, but not limited to, such\nconsiderations as whether the foreign country is known to target United\nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a\nrisk of terrorism.\nAG \u00b6 7 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be\ndisqualifying (DC). Those that could be applicable in this case include the following: (a)\ncontact with a foreign family member, business or professional associate, friend, or\nother person who is a citizen of or resident in a foreign country if that contact creates a\nheightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion;\n(d) sharing living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of citizenship status, if\nthat relationship creates a heightened risk of foreign inducement, manipulation,\npressure, or coercion. Applicant\u2019s relatives, who are citizens and residents of Iran, a\ncountry whose interest is inimical to the United States, and who continue to have, by his\n\n6\nown admission, very close bonds to Applicant, make DC (a) and (d) concerns to the\nGovernment.\nI do not find that any MC is applicable to this Applicant and this case. I therefore,\nconclude Guideline B against Applicant.\nGuideline C, Foreign Preference\nUnder AG \u00b6 9 the security concern involving foreign preference arises, \u201c[W]hen\nan individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a foreign country over\nthe United States, then he or she may be prone to provide information or make\ndecisions that are harmful to the interests of the United States.\u201d\nApplicant\u2019s application, receipt and multiple use of an Iranian passport, and his\nvoting in an Iranian election after becoming a U.S. citizen, raises foreign preference\nconcerns under Disqualifying Condition DC 10 (a), the exercise of the privilege of\nforeign citizenship.\nSince Applicant continues to maintain his Iranian passport, which he has used\noften in the past and plans to potentially use in the future, and he is not willing to\nrenounce his Iranian citizenship to the proper Iranian authorities, I do not find that any\nMC under this guideline applies to this case. After considering all of the evidence of\nrecord on Guideline C, I conclude that the disqualifying evidence substantially\noutweighs the mitigating evidence. \nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation\nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent\nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d\nUnder AG \u00b6 2 (c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.      \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Based on all of the reasons cited\nabove as to why the Disqualifying Conditions apply, I find that the record evidence\nleaves me significant questions and  doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for\na security clearance under the whole person concept. For all these reasons, I conclude\nApplicant has failed to mitigated the security concerns. \n\n7\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline B:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a. through 1.i.:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline C:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a. through 2.d.:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n                                              \nMartin H. Mogul\nAdministrative Judge\n",

His admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a thorough review of the evidence of record, and having considered Applicant\u2019s demeanor and testimony, I make the following additional findings of fact. 1 On Aug. 30, 2006, the Under Secretary of Defense (Intelligence) published a memorandum directing application of revised Adjudicative Guidelines in all adjudications and other determinations made under the Directive and Department of Defense (DoD) Regulation 5200.2-R, Personnel Security Program (Regulation), dated Jan. 1987, as amended, in which the SOR was issued on or after Sep. 1, 2006. 3 Applicant is a 56-year-old senior staff software engineer working for a defense contractor.

He married in 1986, and was divorced in 1998. Applicant worked for government contractors from 1976 to 1993. During that time he had access to classified information at the secret level.

Smith, III, Esquire \n \n \n \n__________ \n \nDecision \n__________ \n \n \nRIVERA, Juan J., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant has a repeating pattern of abusing alcohol to cope with stress and \nemotional issues and there is a concern about whether Applicant will be able to control \nhis cravings for alcohol. A seven month period of abstinence is not sufficient to mitigate \nApplicant\u2019s long-time abuse of alcohol. At this time, his favorable evidence is not \nsufficient, to show it is unlikely that he will have an alcohol-related relapse. He mitigated \nthe personal conduct concern, but failed to mitigate the security concerns arising from \nhis alcohol consumption. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn November 16, 2007, Applicant submitted a security clearance application. On \nFebruary 20, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) (amended on May 20, 2009) to him, pursuant to \nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry, dated \nFebruary 20, 1960, as amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive), \nNovember 23, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n \n                                           \ndated January 2, 1992, as modified and revised.1 The SOR (as amended) alleges \nsecurity concerns under Guideline E (Personal Conduct), and Guideline G (Alcohol \nConsumption). The SOR detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary \naffirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant or continue a security clearance for him, and it recommended referral to \nan administrative judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, denied or \nrevoked. \n \nOn April 16, 2009 and on June 4, 2009, Applicant responded to the SOR \nallegations, and requested a hearing before an administrative judge. The case was \nassigned to me on June 5, 2009. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on June 25, 2009. \nThe hearing was convened as scheduled on July 8, 2009. The government offered \nGovernment Exhibits (GE) 1 through 7, all of which were admitted without objection, \nexcept for GE 5, which was withdrawn (Tr. 16, 132). Applicant testified on his own \nbehalf, presented four witnesses, and submitted Applicant Exhibits (AE) 1 through 10, \nwhich were admitted without objection. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) \non July 17, 2009.  \n \nProcedural Issues \n \n \nOn May 20, 2009, the government amended the SOR issued on February 20, \n2009, by deleting the Guideline J concern in SOR \u00b6 1, and alleging in its place a \nGuideline E concern. I granted the amendment without objection (Tr. 10). \n \nApplicant affirmatively waived his 15 days advance notice of the date of his \nhearing. Department counsel telephonically contacted Applicant on June 18, 2009 to \nascertain a convenient date to schedule Applicant\u2019s hearing. On June 23, 2009, they \nagreed to schedule Applicant\u2019s hearing on July 8, 2009. At his hearing, Applicant \nindicated he had sufficient time to prepare for his hearing, and that he was ready to \nproceed (Tr. 8). \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant admitted the factual allegations under SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b, and 2.a and \n2.d. He denied the allegations under SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.b and 2.c. His admissions are \nincorporated herein as findings of fact. After a thorough review of the evidence of \nrecord, and having considered Applicant\u2019s demeanor and testimony, I make the \nfollowing additional findings of fact. \n \n \n1  On Aug. 30, 2006, the Under Secretary of Defense (Intelligence) published a memorandum \ndirecting application of revised Adjudicative Guidelines in all adjudications and other determinations made \nunder the Directive and Department of Defense (DoD) Regulation 5200.2-R, Personnel Security Program \n(Regulation), dated Jan. 1987, as amended, in which the SOR was issued on or after Sep. 1, 2006.  \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \nApplicant is a 56-year-old senior staff software engineer working for a defense \ncontractor. He graduated from college in 1994, and received a Bachelor of Arts degree \nin English. He also completed his Master of Software Systems Engineering degree that \nsame year. He married in 1986, and was divorced in 1998.  \n \nApplicant worked for government contractors from 1976 to 1993. During that time \nhe had access to classified information at the secret level. Between 1993 and 1998, he \nhad no need for and required no access to classified information. In 1998, he again was \ngranted access to classified information at the secret level. He has continuously \npossessed access to classified information to the present. Outside of the current SOR \nallegations, there is no evidence he has ever compromised classified information, \ncommitted any security violations, or caused others to compromise classified \ninformation. \n \nApplicant started to consume alcohol to excess in 1981. His abuse of alcohol \nescalated in 1986 when he was consuming alcoholic beverages before reporting to \nwork and during the work day. Between July 1986 and September 1986, Applicant \nreported to work numerous times while under the influence of alcohol, and twice he was \nintoxicated to the point of being disoriented and confused. On September 22, 1986, he \nwas the subject of a serious incident report to the Defense Industrial Security Clearance \nOffice (GE 1). He claimed that he stop consuming alcoholic beverages for several years \nafter these incidents (Tr. 159). \n \nApplicant explained then that his mid 1980s alcohol abuse was caused by the \nstresses he suffered because of his father\u2019s serious illness, his wedding, and adapting \nto married life. In his January 1987 sworn statement to a government background \ninvestigator, Applicant considered himself to be a recovering alcoholic. He \nacknowledged then that the only way to control his alcohol abuse was not to start \ndrinking. He stated he had sought counseling for alcohol abuse more than once, and \nthat he would seek formal counseling if he was not able to remain abstinent. Applicant \npromised to remain sober (GE 2). \n \nIn July 1998, Applicant illegally used marijuana. At the time, he was holding a \nsecurity clearance. He testified he only used marijuana once, and that he has never \nabused any other illegal drugs. He terminated his association with the person who \noffered him the marijuana. He promised never to use any illegal drugs ever again (Tr. \n139).  \n \nHe stated that in 2000 and 2002, he attended Alcoholic Anonymous and Rational \nRecovery support groups to learn from others how to control his use of alcohol. He was \nfinding it difficult to avoid or to limit his use of alcohol when stressed. His brother died in \nNovember 2003, and Applicant was having difficulty dealing with his brother\u2019s death, his \nbrother\u2019s surviving family, and his personal work and romantic stresses. The treatment \nhelped him deal with the emotional stress (GE 4). In 2003 and 2004, Applicant \nconsulted with two different doctors. He was concerned about his use of alcohol as a \nmeans of coping with emotional stress and depression. \n\n \n4 \n \n \n \nIn June 2005, Applicant was charged with driving under the influence (DUI) of \nalcohol. He pled nolo contendere and enrolled in a DUI First Offender Program. He \nsuccessfully completed a 12-week court-ordered alcohol rehabilitation and counseling \nprogram, and was released early of his probation in February 2006 (GE 7). While in the \nalcohol rehabilitation and counseling program, apparently Applicant was diagnosed as \nalcohol dependent. There is no evidence as to whether the diagnosis was performed by \na qualified medical professional or a licensed clinical social worker as required under \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 22(d) and (e). The counselors at the rehabilitation counseling program \nrecommended no follow on treatment (AE 3).   \n \nIn his September 2008 response to DOHA interrogatories, Applicant provided a \ndetailed accountability of his then alcohol consumption. He stated he was consuming \napproximately nine ounces of vodka, nearly daily. His last intoxication was on his \nbirthday in July 2008. He would get intoxicated as often as once every two to three \nmonths. Applicant indicated that if his then consumption of alcohol threatened his \nsecurity clearance, he would enroll in a treatment program, participate in group \ncounseling, and abstain from alcohol.  \n \nIn March 2009, after receipt of his SOR, Applicant sought the assistance of a \npsychiatrist to control his excessive consumption of alcohol. He was prescribed two \nmedications to help him remain abstinent. Applicant claimed he has been abstinent \nsince March 4, 2009 (Tr. 165). The psychiatrist recommended Applicant attend Smart \nRecovery (group counseling program) weekly, and was referred for further alcohol \ntreatment to an addiction counselor. In the psychiatrist\u2019s opinion, as of June 2009, \nApplicant has remedied his alcohol consumption problem. He has been abstinent, \ncompliant with the treatment recommendations, attended Smart Recovery (AE 6 & 7) \nand continues to take his medications. The psychiatrist believes Applicant does not \npose a risk to the handling of classified information (AE 1).  \n \nAccording to Applicant\u2019s cardiologist\u2019s opinion, Applicant has never been alcohol \ndependent, and he has been abstinent since March 2009. The cardiologist\u2019s opinion is \nbased on his personal observations of Applicant during the last nine years and medical \ndata he has compiled concerning Applicant since 2000 (AE 2). \n \nIn April 2009, Applicant was referred by his psychiatrist for a substance abuse \nevaluation. The evaluation was conducted by a master addiction counselor and \nsubstance abuse professional. In the counselor\u2019s opinion, Applicant has a history of \nmoderate to severe level of alcohol abuse. The counselor opined that Applicant did not \nmeet the criteria for an alcohol dependence diagnosis. He also believes that during the \npast six months, Applicant made significant lifestyle changes that indicate alcohol is no \nlonger a problem for Applicant (AE 4). Based on his counselor\u2019s advice, Applicant \nattended and participated in the Smart Recovery program from May to July 2009 (AE 6). \n \nAt his hearing, Applicant presented the testimony of the vice president of his \ncompany, his direct supervisor and friend, and his manager. The vice president has \n\n \n5 \n \n \nknown Applicant for 30 years. They were colleagues in 1986 at the same company \nwhere Applicant reported for work in an intoxicated state. After this incident, the vice \npresident never saw Applicant impaired at work ever again. In his opinion, Applicant has \nan excellent reputation for truthfulness and veracity. To his knowledge, Applicant has \nnever been involved in a security violation. He believes Applicant is not a risk to national \nsecurity and endorses Applicant\u2019s security clearance without reservations. \n \nApplicant\u2019s supervisor and his manager have known and worked with Applicant \nsince around 1995. They have had daily contact with Applicant since 2004. Both \nconsider Applicant an outstanding employee and believe Applicant is held in high \nesteem by all of his colleagues. In their opinions, Applicant is conscientious in the \nhandling of classified information, and does an outstanding job complying with all \nsecurity rules and procedures. Applicant has never been involved in a security violation. \nThey believe Applicant is not a risk to national security, and both endorsed Applicant\u2019s \nsecurity clearance without reservations. \n \nApplicant expressed remorse for his behavior and alcohol consumption. He is \nvery concerned about loosing his security clearance and his job. Applicant promised \nthat his questionable alcohol-related behavior will not happen again. He has continued \nhis addiction counseling to learn to control his impulses, and is participating in group \ncounseling. Moreover, he is also taking medications to assist him to remain abstinent.  \n \nApplicant has been successfully working for several government contractors for \nover 30 years. He affirmed that he can be trusted to serve with honor and integrity. \nApplicant takes the security clearance process seriously. He averred he has been \ntruthful, honest, and forthcoming throughout the whole process. Applicant believes he \nhas learned to control his alcohol consumption and is rehabilitated.  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the \nExecutive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security, \nemphasizing that \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy \nv. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the \nauthority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine \nwhether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. \nat 527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.    \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the Applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not \ninflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and \n\n \n6 \n \n \ncommonsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  \n \nThe government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. Clearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and \nshall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the [A]pplicant concerned.\u201d  See \nExec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), Section 3. Thus, \nnothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, \nin whole or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant\u2019s allegiance, \nloyalty, or patriotism. It is merely an indication that the Applicant has not met the strict \nguidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a \nclearance. \n \nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the Applicant that may disqualify the Applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an Applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).      \n \nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the Applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An Applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue [his or her] security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of \ndisproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the government. See ISCR Case No. \n02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, \nif they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \nAG \u00b6 15 explains why personal conduct is a security concern: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \n\n \n7 \n \n \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \nBetween July 1986 and September 1986, Applicant reported to work numerous \ntimes while under the influence of alcohol, and twice he was intoxicated at work, \ndisoriented and confused. In July 1998, Applicant illegally used marijuana, while holding \na security clearance. In June 2005, Applicant drove under the influence (DUI) of alcohol \nand was subject to judicial proceedings. \n \nApplicant\u2019s behavior triggers the applicability of disqualifying condition AG \u00b6 \n16(c):  \n \ncredible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is not \nsufficient for an adverse determination under any other single guideline, \nbut which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-person \nassessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, \nlack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other \ncharacteristics indicating that the person may not properly safeguard \nprotected information. \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 17 lists seven conditions that could mitigate personal conduct security \nconcerns:  \n \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was \ncaused or significantly contributed to by improper or inadequate advice of \nauthorized personnel or legal counsel advising or instructing the individual \nspecifically concerning the security clearance process. Upon being made \naware of the requirement to cooperate or provide the information, the \nindividual cooperated fully and truthfully; \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, \nor other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur; \n \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress;  \n\n \n8 \n \n \n \n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable \nreliability; and \n \n(g) association with persons involved in criminal activity has ceased or \noccurs under circumstances that do not cast doubt upon the individual's \nreliability, trustworthiness, judgment, or willingness to comply with rules \nand regulations. \n \nAfter considering the above mitigating conditions, I find that AG \u00b6\u00b6 17(a), 17(b), \nand 17(f) do not apply to the facts of this case. I specifically considered AG \u00b6 17(c), and \ndetermined it partially applies. Applicant\u2019s DUI and use of illegal drugs while holding a \nsecurity clearance constitute serious offenses. However, both incidents are temporally \nremote and the behavior is infrequent. As such, I find that these incidents do not cast \ndoubt on his judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. His alcohol-related behavior \nwould be better addressed under Guideline G. \n \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 17(d) and 17(e) apply. Applicant has acknowledged his questionable \nalcohol-related behavior. He has obtained psychiatric treatment, is taking medications, \nand participated in addiction and group counseling to change his behavior. He has \ntaken positive steps to change his lifestyle and to alleviate the stressors that caused his \nquestionable behavior. By his actions, he has reduced his vulnerability to exploitation or \nmanipulation. AG \u00b6 17(g) applies because Applicant no longer associates with the \nindividual who provided him the marijuana. Considering the evidence as a whole, I find \nApplicant has mitigated the Guideline E security concerns. \n \nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption \n \n  \nUnder Guideline G the government\u2019s concern is that excessive alcohol \nconsumption often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment or the failure to \ncontrol impulses, and can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability and \ntrustworthiness. AG \u00b6 21. \n \nThe government established its case under Guideline G by showing that \nApplicant has consumed alcohol to excess intermittently since 1981. His abuse of \nalcohol escalated between July 1986 and September 1986, when Applicant reported to \nwork numerous times while under the influence of alcohol, and twice he was intoxicated \nat work. He was abstinent for several years after this incident. \n \nApplicant\u2019s alcohol abuse was caused by stress. He considers himself to be a \nrecovering alcoholic. He acknowledged then that the only way to control his alcohol \nabuse was not to start drinking. He has sought counseling for alcohol abuse more than \nonce. In 2003 and 2004, Applicant consulted with two different doctors because he was \nfinding it difficult to avoid or to limit his use of alcohol when under stress. He was \nconcerned about his use of alcohol as a means of coping with emotional stress and \n\n \n9 \n \n \ndepression. In 2000 and 2002, he attended Alcoholic Anonymous and Rational \nRecovery support groups to learn from others how to control his use of alcohol.  \n \nIn June 2005, Applicant drove under the influence (DUI) of alcohol. As of \nSeptember 2008, Applicant was consuming approximately nine ounces of vodka, nearly \ndaily. His last intoxication was in July 2008. He would get intoxicated as often as once \nevery two to three months.  \n \nApplicant established a history of excessive consumption of alcohol, at times to \nthe point of intoxication. Applicant\u2019s excessive alcohol consumption resulted in his \nexercising questionable judgment. Guideline G disqualifying conditions AG \u00b6 22(a): \n\u201calcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under the influence,\u201d \nAG \u00b6 22(b): \u201calcohol-related incidents at work, such as reporting for work in an \nintoxicated or impaired condition,\u201d and AG \u00b6 22(c): \u201chabitual or binge consumption of \nalcohol to the point of impaired judgment, regardless of whether the individual is \ndiagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent,\u201d apply.  \n \n \nThere is no evidence that Applicant has been involved in any alcohol-related \nmisconduct since June 2005. Available evidence shows Applicant continued consuming \nalcohol up to at least March 2009.  \n \n  \nThere are four Alcohol Consumption Mitigating Conditions under AG \u00b6 23 \npotentially applicable to these disqualifying conditions: \n \n \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, \nor good judgment;  \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her alcoholism or issues of alcohol \nabuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence (if alcohol dependent) or \nresponsible use (if an alcohol abuser);  \n \n \n(c) the individual is a current employee who is participating in a counseling \nor treatment program, has no history of previous treatment and relapse, \nand is making satisfactory progress; and \n \n(d) the individual has successfully completed inpatient or outpatient \ncounseling or rehabilitation along with any required aftercare, has \ndemonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or \nabstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations, such as \nparticipation in meetings of Alcoholics Anonymous or a similar \norganization and has received a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified \n\n \n10 \n \n \nmedical professional or a licensed clinical social worker who is a staff \nmember of a recognized alcohol treatment program. \n \n \nAfter considering the mitigating conditions, I find that they partially apply. \nApplicant\u2019s last alcohol-related behavior occurred in June 2005, and as such, it may be \nconsidered temporally remote. However, after his 2005 DUI, he continued his excessive \nalcohol consumption. He was getting intoxicated once every two to three months, and \nhe was last intoxicated in July 2008. He has been abstinent only since March 2009.  \n \n \nApplicant has acknowledged his questionable alcohol-related behavior. He \nobtained psychiatric treatment, has been taking medications, and participated in \naddiction counseling and group counseling to change his behavior. He has taken \npositive steps to change his lifestyle and to alleviate the stressors that caused his \nquestionable behavior. By his actions, he has reduced his vulnerability to exploitation or \nmanipulation.  \n \n \nConsidering the totality of the circumstances, at this time, Applicant\u2019s past \nquestionable alcohol-related behavior does cast doubt on his judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. He has had alcohol-related problems during the last 20 years. He has \nlong been aware of what is required of him to avoid future alcohol-related problems; \nnotwithstanding, he continued to consume alcohol to excess. The Guideline G security \nconcern is not fully mitigated. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n Under the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nThe ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance \nmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nguidelines and the whole person concept. AG \u00b6 2(c).   \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is a mature and well-\neducated man. He has been successful working for several defense contractors for \n\n \n11 \n \n \nmore than 30 years. During most of this time he had access to classified information. \nThere is no evidence he has ever compromised classified information or committed any \nsecurity violations. To the contrary, Applicant is considered to be conscientious about \nhis security duties and has a reputation for following security rules and procedures. \n \nHe has established a reputation as a valuable, dedicated and reliable employee. \nApplicant expressed remorse for his questionable behavior and is resolute in avoiding \nsimilar behavior. He obtained psychiatric treatment, has been taking medications to \nassist him remaining sober, and participated in addiction counseling and group \ncounseling to change his behavior. He has taken positive steps to change his lifestyle \nand to alleviate the stressors that caused his questionable behavior. He has been \nabstinent since March 2009. Applicant is aware of what is required of him to possess a \nsecurity clearance and has promised to remain sober. These factors show \nresponsibility, good judgment, and mitigation. \n \nOn the other hand, Applicant has developed a repeating pattern of abusing \nalcohol to cope with stress and emotional issues and there is a concern about whether \nApplicant will be able to control his cravings for alcohol. On balance, I conclude that \nApplicant\u2019s favorable evidence is not sufficient, at this time, to show it is unlikely that he \nwill have an alcohol-related relapse. I find that a seven month period of abstinence is \nnot sufficient to mitigate Applicant\u2019s long-time abuse of alcohol. I conclude he has \nmitigated the personal conduct concern, but failed to mitigate the security concerns \narising from his alcohol consumption. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline E:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.b: \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline G:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.d: \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n\n \n12 \n \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue eligibility for a security \nclearance for Applicant. Eligibility for a security clearance is denied. \n \n \n \n____________________________ \nJUAN J. RIVERA \nAdministrative Judge \n",

On May 27, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued \nApplicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under \nGuideline F. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of \nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative \nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective \nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on June 11, 2008. He answered the \nSOR in writing on July 28, 2008, and requested a hearing before an administrative \njudge. I received the case assignment on August 27, 2008.  DOHA issued a Notice of \nHearing on October 20, 2008, and I convened the hearing as scheduled on November \n6, 2008. The Government offered Exhibits 1 through 5, which were received without \nobjection. Applicant testified and submitted Exhibits A through E, without objection. \n \n1 \n \n \nDecember 31, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \n \nDOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on November 17, 2007. Based upon a \nreview of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to \nclassified information is granted. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, dated July 28, 2008, Applicant admitted the factual \nallegations in the SOR, with explanations about his payment arrangements for each \ndebt. He also provided additional information to support his request for eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance.   \n \n \nApplicant is 34 years old, unmarried, and has no children.  He works as a \ncomputer technician for a defense contractor.  He started this job in December 2007. \n(Tr. 25-31; Exhibit 1) \n \n \nApplicant has 12 delinquent debts totaling $23,606 listed in the SOR.  Of those \n12 debts, four listed are for private student loans he borrowed for his associate\u2019s \ndegree.  Those four loans total about $22,000 of the total debt listed in the SOR.  He \nalso has 10 student loans not listed in the SOR which are consolidated federally insured \nloans and are in forbearance.  These student loans total about $16,000.

He made three payments in \n2008 of between $89 and $100 on those loans, even though they are in forbearance.  \nSeven of the debts listed in the SOR are medical expenses he incurred in the past five \nyears.  The remaining debt for $20 (Paragraph 1.g) owed to a telephone company he \npaid. (Tr. 37-47, 51, 56, 58, 67; Exhibits 1-5) \n \n \nAfter his interview with a Government investigator, he took the list of delinquent \ndebts to a consumer credit counseling service.  That service structured a budget and \nrepayment plan for his delinquent debts for him.  He pays that service $75 monthly to \nrepay all the debts listed in the SOR, which are his only delinquent debts, except for the \nfour student loans listed (Paragraphs 1.h to 1.k), and the telephone bill in Paragraph 1.g \nin the SOR.  Applicant submitted proof of payment of his first three installment \npayments to the credit counseling service, from August 2008 to October 2008.  He \nmade the November payment immediately before the hearing. The delinquent medical \ndebts listed in Paragraphs 1.a to 1.f, and 1.l of the SOR total $1,801, and are being paid \nin the consumer counseling service installment plan used by Applicant. (Tr. 41, 42, 48-\n55, 58, 59; Exhibits 1-5, B-D) \n \n \nApplicant pays the four student loans listed in the SOR on a separate installment \npayment plan he negotiated.  He sends $300 monthly to the manager of those student \nloans.  He made the November 2008 payment two days before the hearing.  He \nsubmitted proof of payment of the June through October 2008 payments. (Tr. 43-45, 61, \n62; Exhibits 1-5, D) \n \n \nApplicant has no credit cards, no tax debts, and is current on all his monthly \nfinancial obligations.  Over the past few years, he has learned to live inexpensively, \n\n \n3 \n \n \nkeep his monthly debts low, lives by himself in an apartment, and works at keeping his \nexpenses under control.  He has a savings account and is trying to build a cash reserve \nfund for emergencies.  He lives near his mother, who is advising him on properly \nmanaging his money because she handles her personal finances in a responsible way \nand wants him to learn from her. (Tr. 62, 69-78) \n \n \nTwo of Applicant\u2019s supervisors, and a co-worker, submitted favorable character \nstatements on his behalf.  They regard him as hard-working, honest, trustworthy, \nconscientious, competent in the computer work, and courteous to the contractor\u2019s \ncustomers. (Tr. 22; Exhibit E) \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information.  Decisions include, by necessity, consideration \n\n \n4 \n \n \nof the possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG & 18:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under \nAG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.  \nSimilarly under AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise \nsecurity concerns. Applicant accumulated some delinquent debt and was unable to pay \nsome obligations for a period of time. The evidence is sufficient to raise these potentially \ndisqualifying conditions, requiring a closer examination. \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG \u00b6 20(a), the disqualifying condition \nmay be mitigated where Athe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ Applicant=s \nfinancial worries arose about 2002 to 2004. He accumulated delinquent debt due to his \ninability to manage properly his finances. These circumstances are no longer extant \nbecause of the good paying job he has now, and his experiences with delinquent debt. \nThe bulk of his debt is for student loans, which is a circumstance not likely to recur for \nthe foreseeable future.  I find the behavior occurred under ordinary circumstances but \nthat it is unlikely to recur, and it does not raise concerns about his current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment. The evidence raises this potentially mitigating \ncondition to have a slight application to this Applicant because his financial situation has \nchanged in the past two years since graduating from technical school.  \n\n \n5 \n \n \n \nUnder AG & 20(b), it may be mitigating where Athe conditions that resulted in the \nfinancial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a \nbusiness downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), \nand the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.@ These factors are not \npresent here. I find this potentially mitigating condition is not a consideration in this \ncase.  \n \nEvidence that Athe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control@ \nis potentially mitigating under AG & 20(c). Similarly, AG & 20(d) applies where the \nevidence shows Athe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts.@ Applicant received counseling, prepared a budget with the \nassistance of the credit counseling service, and is resolving all the delinquent debts by \ninstallment payment agreements through the credit counseling service or by his own \nagreements with the student loan lenders. He is now managing his money responsibly \nand prepared for future contingencies. I conclude these potentially mitigating conditions \napply. \n \n \nThe remaining two mitigating conditions in AG \u00b6 20 do not apply.  Applicant does \nnot dispute the legitimacy of any of the delinquent debts (AG \u00b6 20 (e)).  Nor has any \naffluence occurred (AG \u00b6 20 (f)). \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n \n \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d  \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. When these problems first began, \nApplicant was a young man, and attending college. (See AG & 2(a)(4).) He \n\n \n6 \n \n \naccumulated debt due to poor financial management practices, e.g., spending too much \nmoney, and borrowing for college without developing a plan to repay the loans after \ngraduation. (See AG & 2(a)(2).) Since that time, Applicant has undergone significant \nbehavioral changes. He found a good-paying job, and has been recognized by his \nsupervisors for his dedication, integrity and trustworthiness. Most significantly, he has \ntaken affirmative action to pay or resolve all of the delinquent debts raising security \nconcerns. (See AG & 2(a)(6).) He persuasively and credibly testified to his change in \nattitude and practice toward managing his personal finances, and brought documentary \nproof of his payments to the hearing. Of course, the issue is not simply whether all his \ndebts are paidBit is whether his financial circumstances raise concerns about his fitness \nto hold a security clearance.  All of his delinquent debts are being paid in a responsible \nmanner. (See AG & 2(a)(1).)   \n \nThe Appeal Board has addressed a key element in the whole person analysis in \nfinancial cases stating: \n \nIn evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the concept \nof \u201c\u2018meaningful track record\u2019 necessarily includes evidence of actual debt reduction \nthrough payment of debts.\u201d However, an applicant is not required, as a matter of law, to \nestablish that he has paid off each and every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required \nis that an applicant demonstrate that he has \u2018. . . established a plan to resolve his \nfinancial problems and taken significant actions to implement that plan.\u2019 The Judge can \nreasonably consider the entirety of an applicant\u2019s financial situation and his actions in \nevaluating the extent to which that applicant\u2019s plan for the reduction of his outstanding \nindebtedness is credible and realistic. See Directive \u00b6 E2.2(a) (\u2018Available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be \nconsidered in reaching a determination.\u2019) There is no requirement that a plan provide for \npayments on all outstanding debts simultaneously. Rather, a reasonable plan (and \nconcomitant conduct) may provide for the payment of such debts one at a time. \nLikewise, there is no requirement that the first debts actually paid in furtherance of a \nreasonable debt plan be the ones listed in the SOR.  ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 \n(App. Bd. May 21, 2008) (internal citations omitted). \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant mitigated the security concerns arising from his financial \nconsiderations.  I conclude the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept for Applicant. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a to 1.l:  \n \nFor Applicant \n\n \n7 \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On March 24, 2009, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of\nthe basis for that decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline B (Foreign Influence) of\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant\nrequested a hearing.  On September 22, 2009, after the hearing, Administrative Judge Darlene D.\nLokey Anderson denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant\nto Directive \u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge was biased against him\n\ndue to his Iranian origin and whether the Judge\u2019s adverse security clearance decision is arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.  Finding no error, we affirm.\nThe Judge made the following pertinent findings of fact:  Applicant was born in Iran.  He\nserved in the Iranian Navy for three months.  Subsequently he immigrated to the U.S. to attend\ncollege.  He holds a Master\u2019s degree in electrical engineering and is a systems engineer for a Defense\ncontractor.  He became a U.S. citizen in the early 1990s and has held a security clearance since the\nlate 1990s.  He is married to a U.S.-born citizen and has two children, both of whom were born in\nthe U.S.\nApplicant has five siblings who are citizens of Iran.  Three of them are also residents of Iran.\nHe communicates with each of his family members one to three times a year.  Applicant enjoys an\nexcellent reputation for professionalism and job performance. \nIran is engaged in efforts to obtain weapons of mass destruction, supports international\nterrorism, and has a poor human rights record.  It has no diplomatic relations with the U.S.\n In the Conclusions section of the decision, the Judge noted that Applicant has lived in the\nU.S. for many years and has long held a security clearance.  However, she noted evidence of\nApplicant\u2019s affection and concern for his siblings and that he maintains regular contact with them.\nThe Judge concluded that these bonds of affection are a means through which Applicant might be\nsubjected to foreign coercion.  Accordingly, she concluded that Applicant had not mitigated the\nsecurity concerns in his case.\nRegarding the claim of bias, Applicant contends that his record raises no security concerns\nand that he is being unfairly singled out because of his Middle Eastern heritage.  He has provided\nno support for this contention, other than his disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the\nevidence.  There is a rebuttable presumption that a Judge is impartial and unbiased and a party\nseeking to overcome that presumption has a heavy burden on persuasion.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No.\n07-02253 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 28, 2008); ISCR Case No. 02-08032 at 4 (App. Bd. May 14, 2004).\nIn this case, Applicant has five close relatives who are citizens of Iran, three of whom are also\nresidents of that country, and with whom he communicates by telephone.  The Board notes the 2008\nDepartment of State Human Rights Report on Iran, which is included in the Official Notice\ndocuments.  Among other things, this document demonstrates that, during the year in question,\nIranian officials \u201cmonitored the social activities of citizens, entered homes and offices, monitored\ntelephone conversations and internet communications and opened mail without court authorization.\u201d\nThe evidence supports a conclusion that Applicant\u2019s relatives are a means through which Applicant\nmight come to the attention of the Iranian authorities.  The Board has long held that there is a rational\nconnection between an applicant\u2019s family ties in a country whose interests are adverse to the United\nStates and the risk that the applicant might fail to protect and safeguard classified information.  ISCR\nCase No. 01-26893 (App. Bd. Oct. 16, 2002).  Accordingly, we conclude that Applicant has failed\nto rebut the presumption that the Judge acted impartially.  \nApplicant points out that he has held a security clearance for a number of years without\nincident.  However, prior decisions to grant or retain a clearance do not undermine the legal\n\nsufficiency of a Judge\u2019s subsequent adverse decision.  \u201cThe government is not estopped from making\nan adverse clearance decision when there were prior favorable adjudications.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 07-\n17383 at 2 (App. Bd. Feb. 12, 2009), quoting ISCR Case No. 03-04927 at 5 (App. Bd. Mar. 4, 2005).\nAlthough Applicant has had no previous security infractions, the government need not wait until an\nindividual mishandles or fails to safeguard classified information before it can make an unfavorable\nsecurity clearance decision.  ISCR Case No. 08-00435 at 3 (App. Bd. Jan. 22, 2009), citing Adams\nv. Laird, 420 F. 2d 230, 238-239 (D.C. Cir. 1969), cert. denied 397 U.S. 1039 (1970).  Applicant\u2019s\ngood security record is evidence the Judge was bound to consider; however, it is not enough to\ndemonstrate mitigation as a matter of law.  \nAfter reviewing the record, the Board concludes that the Judge examined the relevant data\nand articulated a satisfactory explanation for the decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between\nthe facts found and the choice made.\u2019\u201d  Motor Vehicle Mfrs.

He seeks a security clearance in connection with his employment in the defense industry. Paragraph 1 (Guideline B - Foreign Influence). The Government alleges in this paragraph that the Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he has foreign contacts that could create the potential for foreign influence that could result in the compromise of classified information. The Applicant was born in Iran in 1952. With his father\u2019s urging, the Applicant served in the Iranian Navy, attending the Iranian Military Academy for about three months before deciding that the military was not for him. The Iranian Government allowed the Applicant to take an examination to enter the Navy and/ or study abroad. He elected to attend college in the United States. In 1972, he immigrated to the United States at the age of nineteen, and entered on a student visa. He stayed in the United States because he liked the culture and the freedoms of thought, speech, and religion. (Government Exhibit 3). In 1982, he became a naturalized United States citizen.

This case was assigned to the\nundersigned on May 27, 2009.  A notice of hearing was issued on June 5, 2009,\nscheduling the hearing for June 30, 2009.  At the hearing the Government presented\n\n2\nfour exhibits, referred to as Government Exhibits 1 through 4, that were admitted\nwithout objection.  The Applicant presented one exhibit, referred to as Applicant\u2019s\nExhibit A, that was admitted without objection. He also testified on his own behalf.  The\nrecord remained open to allow the Applicant to submit additional documentary\ninformation.  The Applicant submitted four Post-Hearing Exhibits, referred to as Post-\nHearing Exhibits A through D.  The official transcript (Tr.) was received on July 10,\n2009.  Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony,\neligibility for access to classified information is denied.\nRequest for Administrative Notice\nDepartment Counsel submitted a formal request that I take administrative notice\nof certain facts concerning the current political condition in Iran.  The Applicant had no\nobjection.  (Tr. p. 22).  The request and the attached documents were not admitted into\nevidence but were included in the record. The facts administratively noticed are set out\nin the Findings of Fact, below. \nFINDINGS OF FACT\nThe following Findings of Fact are based on Applicant's Answer to the SOR, the\ntestimony and the exhibits.  The Applicant is 57 years of age and has a Master\u2019s Degree\nin Electrical Engineering.  He is employed as a Aerospace Systems Engineer for a\ndefense contractor.  He seeks a security clearance in connection with his employment\nin the defense industry.\nParagraph 1 (Guideline B - Foreign Influence).  The Government alleges in this\nparagraph that the Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he has foreign contacts\nthat could create the potential for foreign influence that could result in the compromise\nof classified information.\nThe Applicant was born in Iran in 1952.  With his father\u2019s urging, the Applicant\nserved in the Iranian Navy, attending the Iranian Military Academy for about three\nmonths before deciding that the military was not for him.  The Iranian Government\nallowed the Applicant to take an examination to enter the Navy and/ or study abroad.\nHe elected to attend college in the United States.  In 1972, he immigrated to the United\nStates at the age of nineteen, and entered on a student visa.  He stayed in the United\nStates because he liked the culture and the freedoms of thought, speech, and religion.\n(Government Exhibit 3).  In 1982, he became a naturalized United States citizen.  He\nhas worked for the defense industry since the late 1970's, and has held an active\nsecurity clearance since 1997.  (See Government Exhibit 1).  He has returned to Iran on\nonly one occasion in the summer of 2000, to visit his ailing mother.  He is married to a\nnative born United States citizen, and they have two native born American children.    \nThe Applicant also has five siblings, three sisters and two brothers who are\ncitizens of Iran.  Three of them, two sisters and one brother, reside in Iran.  All of his\nsiblings are professionals.  His mother and father have since passed away.  His mother,\n\n3\nwas a housewife her entire life, supported by her husband\u2019s pension.  She passed away\nseveral months ago.  The Applicant\u2019s father was a colonel in the Army in the Shah\u2019s\nregime, and passed away in 1997.  \nThe Applicant\u2019s oldest sister is 59 years old and is a pediatrician in private\npractice.  Her husband is also a physician.  They are both citizens and residents of Iran\nThe Applicant has applied for residency for his oldest sister.  (Tr. p. 63).  His next sister\nin birth order is 58 years old, a dual citizen of Iran who lives in England. She is a high\nschool teacher.  The Applicant\u2019s next brother is 55 years old, and is a citizen and\nresident of Iran.  He is also a physician.  The next brother in birth order is 53 years old,\nand is a dual citizen of Iran and the United States and resides here.  He is an engineer.\nThe Applicant\u2019s youngest sister is 50 years old, and is a citizen and resident of Iran.\nShe is an architect.  She spent about six months in the United States before going to\nschool in England.  She has since moved back to Iran.  The Applicant spoke to her last\nweekend to see if she was safe.  (Tr. p. 56).  The Applicant communicates with each of\nhis family members in Iran from one to three times a year.  They know that he is an\nengineer, but do not know that he is applying for a security clearance.  Over the years,\nseveral of his siblings have come to the United States to visit the Applicant.   \n      \nThe Applicant testified that he is ashamed that he did not go back for his\nmother\u2019s funeral.  He could not find his Iranian passport.  (Tr. p. 58, and Government\nExhibit 2).  He chose not to travel using his United States passport in fear that he might\nbe given a hard time.  (Tr. p. 58).  He feels bad and ashamed that he has not kept in\ncloser contact with his siblings in Iran.  (Tr. p. 60).  He loves his siblings in Iran very\nmuch.  (Tr. p. 60 - 61).  The Applicant indicates that at the present time he has no\nintentions of going back to Iran.  (Tr. p. 58).      \nA letter of appreciation from a Program Director who has worked closely with the\nApplicant on a particular program attests to the Applicant\u2019s hard work, support, and\ndedication to ensuring that the mission was a success.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit A).  \nA letter of commendation dated November 13, 2007, from a Program Director\nand a Commander reflects that the Applicant has shown superb professionalism and\noutstanding commitment in the performance of his job.  (Applicant\u2019s Post-Hearing\nExhibit C).  \nApplicant received a Certificate of Appreciation dated November 13, 2007, for\noutstanding support, professionalism and service to a program.  (Applicant\u2019s Post-\nHearing Exhibit B).\nApplicant\u2019s Performance Appraisal for the period from January 1, 2007, through\nDecember 31, 2007, reflects an overall rating that \u201cexceeds performance requirements\u201d.\n(Applicant\u2019s Post-Hearing Exhibit D).\nI have taken administrative notice of the current political conditions in Iran.  The\nfact that Iran has no diplomatic relations with the United States, Iran\u2019s efforts to acquire\nnuclear weapons and other weapon of mass destruction, its support for and involvement\n\n4\nin international terrorism, it\u2019s violent opposition to the Middle East peace process, and\nit\u2019s dismal human rights records, have been noted.  I have considered the fact that\nIranian Government officials at all levels commit serious abuses of their power and\nauthority.  Iran\u2019s totalitarian government is rampant with terrorists activities, crime and\ninstability.  The overall deteriorating security situation in Iran, the human rights abuses,\nand the government corruption elevates the cause for concern in the case.  The United\nStates may face no greater challenge from a single country than from Iran.    \n      \nPOLICIES\nSecurity clearance decisions are not made in a vacuum.  Accordingly, the\nDepartment of Defense, in Enclosure 2 of the 1992  Directive sets forth policy factors\nand conditions that could raise or mitigate a security concern; which must be given\nbinding consideration in making security clearance determinations.  These factors\nshould be followed in every case according to the pertinent criterion.  However, the\nconditions are neither automatically determinative of the decision in any case, nor can\nthey supersede the Administrative Judge\u2019s reliance on her own common sense.\nBecause each security clearance case presents its own unique facts and\ncircumstances, it cannot be assumed that these factors exhaust the realm of human\nexperience, or apply equally in every  case.  Based on the Findings of Fact set forth\nabove, the factors most applicable to the evaluation of this case are:\nForeign Influence\n6.  The Concern.  Foreign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the\nindividual has divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or\ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way that is not\nin U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by any foreign interest.\nAdjudication under this Guideline can and should consider the identity of the foreign\ncountry in which the foreign contact or financial interest is located, including, but not\nlimited to, such considerations as whether the foreign country is known to target United\nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a risk of\nterrorism. \nCondition that could raise a security concern:\n7.  (a) contact with a foreign family member, business or professional associate,\nfriend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident of a foreign country if that contact\ncreates a heightened risks of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure,\nor coercion. \nCondition that could mitigate security concerns:\nNone.\n\n5\nIn addition, as set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive at pages 18-19, in\nevaluating the relevance of an individual\u2019s conduct, the Administrative Judge should\nconsider the following general factors:\n a.  The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct \n     b.  The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation\nc.  The frequency and recency of the conduct\nd.  The individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct\ne.  The extent to which participation is voluntary \nf.  The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral\nchanges\ng.  The motivation for the conduct \nh. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress; and\n \ni.  The likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nThe eligibility criteria established in the DoD Directive identify personal\ncharacteristics and conduct which are reasonably related to the ultimate question,\nposed in Section 2 of Executive Order 10865, of whether it is \u201cclearly consistent with the\nnational interest\u201d to grant an Applicant\u2019s request for access to classified information.\nThe DoD Directive states, \u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a\nsufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the person is\neligible for a security clearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is\npredicted upon the individual meeting these personnel security guidelines.  The\nadjudicative process is the careful weighing of a number of variables known as the\nwhole person concept.  Available, reliable information about the person, past and\npresent, favorable and unfavorable should be considered in reaching a determination.\nThe Administrative Judge can draw only those inferences or conclusions that have\nreasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record.  The Judge cannot draw\ninferences or conclusions based on evidence which is speculative or conjectural in\nnature.  Finally, as emphasized by President Eisenhower in Executive Order 10865,\n\u201cAny determination under this order . . . shall be a determination in terms of the national\ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the Applicant\nconcerned.\u201d\nThe Government must make out a case under Guideline B (foreign influence)\nthat establishes doubt about a person's judgment, reliability and trustworthiness.  While\na rational connection, or nexus, must be shown between Applicant's adverse conduct\n\n6\nand his ability to effectively safeguard classified information, with respect to sufficiency\nof proof of a rational connection, objective or direct evidence is not required.  Then, the\nApplicant must remove that doubt with substantial evidence in refutation, explanation,\nmitigation or extenuation, which demonstrates that the past adverse conduct is unlikely\nto be repeated, and that the Applicant presently qualifies for a security clearance.\nAn individual who has foreign connections may be prone to provide information\nor make decisions that are harmful to the interests of the United States.  The\nGovernment must be able to place a high degree of confidence in a security clearance\nholder to abide by all security rules and regulations, at all times and in all places.\nCONCLUSIONS\nHaving considered the evidence of record in light of the appropriate legal\nstandards and factors, and having assessed the Applicant's credibility based on the\nrecord, this Administrative Judge concludes that the Government has established its\ncase as to all allegations in the SOR.   \nUnder Foreign Influence, Disqualifying Condition 7(a) contact with a foreign\nfamily member, business or professional associate, friend, or other person who is a\ncitizen of or resident of a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risks of\nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion applies.  None of\nthe mitigating conditions apply.  Applicant did not show that his emotional connection to\nthe United States is greater than that to Iran. \nIt is acknowledged that the Applicant has lived in the United States for thirty\nyears.  During this period, he has held a  security clearance and worked for the defense\nindustry.  He has a wife and two sons who are native born United States citizens.\nHowever, tipping the scales on the other side is the fact that the Applicant has five\nsiblings, who are citizens of Iran, three of whom reside in Iran, with all of whom he\nmaintains a close and continuing relationship.  He loves his siblings in Iran and\nmaintains regular ongoing contact with them by telephone between one and three times\na year.  With three siblings in Iran, he talks to at least one of them on an average of\nonce a month.  Although there is no evidence that any of his family members in Iran are\nassociated in any way with the Iranian government, there is evidence of a close bond\nand strong evidence of affection with his immediate family.  This bond and affection with\nhis family could potentially cause the Applicant to become subject to foreign\nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion.  Moreover, the current\npolitical situation in Iran elevates the cause for concern in this case.  The possibility of\nforeign influence exists that could create the potential for conduct resulting in the\ncompromise of classified information.  It is the Applicant\u2019s burden to show that he is\neligible for a security clearance, not the Government\u2019s to show that he is not.  I find that\nthe Applicant is vulnerable to foreign influence.  \nI have also considered the \u201cwhole person concept\u201d in evaluating the Applicant\u2019s\neligibility for access to classified information.  Under the particular facts of this case, the\n\n7\ntotality of the conduct set forth under all of the guidelines viewed as a whole, support a\nwhole person assessment of poor judgement, untrustworthiness, unreliability, a lack of\ncandor, and an unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, and/or other\ncharacteristics indicating that the person may properly safeguard classified information.\nAccordingly, I find against the Applicant under Guideline B (Foreign Influence).\nConsidering all the evidence, the Applicant has not met the mitigating conditions\nof Guideline B of the adjudicative guidelines set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive.\nAccordingly, he has not met his ultimate burden of persuasion under Guideline B.  \nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal Findings For or Against the Applicant on the allegations in the SOR, as\nrequired by Paragraph 25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive are:\nParagraph 1: Against the Applicant.\nSubparas.\n1.a.: Against the Applicant\nSubparas.\n1.b.: Against the Applicant\nSubparas.\n1.c.: Against the Applicant\n \nSubparas.\n1.d.: Against the Applicant\n \n \nDECISION\nIn light of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly\nconsistent with the national interests to grant or continue a security clearance for the\nApplicant.\nDarlene Lokey Anderson\nAdministrative Judge\n \n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is a 38-year-old employee of a government contractor working as a contracts manager supervising seven employees since November 2006. He has been continuously employed in industry since he was honorably discharged from the Air Force as a senior airman (E-6) in 1996 after seven years of active duty (Tr. 37). In his Answer, Applicant admitted the two financial allegations in the SOR relating to approximately $11,000 in delinquent debts arising from two credit card debts accumulated primarily during the latter years of his former marriage between 1991 and 1996. This was a result of bad financial management (Tr. 20). The debts are were for $720 (SOR \u00b6 1.a.) and $10,335 (SOR \u00b6 1.b.). In 2006 and 2007 he used a credit repair service that filed objections to these debts and others with credit reporting agencies. Both were charged off at some point but he engaged the services of a credit counseling service, and, on their advice, had them re-instated (Tr. 24-29). He has now settled the first for $500 (Exh. A) and has negotiated a payment plan for the second (Exh. B). These arrangements were done in July 2008, a month before the hearing in this matter (Tr. 14-15). The voluntary plan provides that the creditor will receive $500 every two weeks withdrawn from Applicant\u2019s bank account. This arrangement was made possible by canceling a contribution of $1,000 per month to his 401(k) plan with his employer. No withdrawals had been made at the time of the hearing. Ap",

Crowley, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nABLARD, Charles D., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant failed to mitigate security concerns regarding Guideline F (Financial\nConsiderations), and Guideline E (Personal Conduct). Eligibility for access to classified\ninformation is denied.\nStatement of the Case\n \nApplicant submitted his Security Clearance Application (SF 86), on October 4,\n2007. On June 12, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns for Applicant under\nGuidelines F (Financial Considerations), and E (Personal Conduct). The action was\ntaken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry\n(February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense\nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as\namended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the\nPresident on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for\nSORs issued after September 1, 2006.\nOctober 31, 2008\n\n2\nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on July 3, 2008, and requested a hearing\nbefore an Administrative Judge. Department Counsel was prepared to proceed on July\n17, 2008. I received the case assignment on July 22, 2008. DOHA issued a notice of\nhearing on July 24, 2008, for a hearing on August 25, 2008. I convened the hearing as\nscheduled. \nAt the hearing, the government offered four exhibits (Exhs 1-4) that were\nadmitted in evidence without objection. Applicant submitted three exhibits (Exhs. A-C)\nthat were admitted without objection. He testified on his own behalf. DOHA received the\ntranscript of the hearing (Tr.) on September 4, 2008. I granted Applicant\u2019s request to\nkeep the record open until September 25, 2008, to submit additional evidence. Nothing\nwas submitted and the record was closed. \nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 38-year-old employee of a government contractor working as a\ncontracts manager supervising seven employees since November 2006. He has been\ncontinuously employed in industry since he was honorably discharged from the Air\nForce as a senior airman (E-6) in 1996 after seven years of active duty (Tr. 37). \nIn his Answer, Applicant admitted the two financial allegations in the SOR relating\nto approximately $11,000 in delinquent debts arising from two credit card debts\naccumulated primarily during the latter years of his former marriage between 1991 and\n1996. This was a result of bad financial management (Tr. 20). The debts are were for\n$720 (SOR \u00b6 1.a.) and $10,335 (SOR \u00b6 1.b.). In 2006 and 2007 he used a credit repair\nservice that filed objections to these debts and others with credit reporting agencies.\nBoth were charged off at some point but he engaged the services of a credit counseling\nservice, and, on their advice, had them re-instated (Tr. 24-29). He has now settled the\nfirst for $500 (Exh. A) and has negotiated a payment plan for the second (Exh. B).\nThese arrangements were done in July 2008, a month before the hearing in this matter\n(Tr. 14-15). The voluntary plan provides that the creditor will receive $500 every two\nweeks withdrawn from Applicant\u2019s bank account. This arrangement was made possible\nby canceling a contribution of $1,000 per month to his 401(k) plan with his employer. No\nwithdrawals had been made at the time of the hearing. \nApplicant denied the personal conduct allegation relating to his failure to report\nthe delinquent debts at Question 28 (a) and (b) of the SF 86. He testified that he\nbelieved the debts had been deleted from his credit reports because of the efforts of his\ncredit repair service in 2007. That had not happened (Exh. 3) and he did not obtain a\ncredit report before filing his SF 86 to determine if it had occurred.  He had reason to\nknow that the debts existed and were his responsibility. He also did not take the\nfinancial issues raised in the security process as seriously as he knows he should have\n(Tr. 48).\nApplicant\u2019s annual salary from his employment is approximately $110,000. He\nhas a 401 (k) account valued at $22,000 to which he was contributing $1,000 a month\nbefore making the arrangement  to the pay the larger SOR debt. \n\n3\nApplicant re-married in 2001 and has three children. The oldest is a step-\ndaughter age 13. The other two are sons ages 7 and 10. The older one is his nephew\nwhom he took into his home when Applicant\u2019s sister, the mother of the child, recently\ndied. He is saving in a college fund for all three children. His wife had worked but is not\nnow, and devotes her time to raising their children and work at the school that the\nchildren attend. \nApplicant does not have a college degree but has over 100 hours of credits in\naerospace management. He is highly regarded by his employer for his dedication, skills,\nand handling of classified materials (Exh. A). He first held a security clearance during\nhis military service when he worked with nuclear materials (Tr. 47). He did not hold one\nwith his former employer, and received an interim clearance with his present employer.\nIt was withdrawn in May 2008 when this matter arose.(Tr. 47).\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\n\u201cthe whole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or\nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision.\n\n4\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship\ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off duty hours. The government\nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk\nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified\ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as\nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.\nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) listing multiple prerequisites for\naccess to classified or sensitive information. \nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set\nout in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure or inability to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.\nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nAG \u00b6 19(a), an \"inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts is potentially disqualifying.\nSimilarly under AG \u00b6 19(c), \"a history of not meeting financial obligations may raise\nsecurity concerns.\u201d Applicant accumulated the delinquent debts cited in the SOR several\nyears ago and has not made payments to the creditors even though he was earning a\nsalary that clearly made payments possible. Thus, the evidence clearly raises these\npotentially disqualifying conditions.\nThe guideline also includes examples of mitigating conditions (MC) that could\nmitigate security concerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG \u00b6 20(a), the\ndisqualifying condition may be mitigated where Athe behavior happened so long ago, was\nso infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does\nnot cast doubt on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@\nMost of Applicant=s financial problems arose over ten years ago but very little was done\nto resolve them until after the SOR was issued despite having a good job with a salary of\nover $100,00 a year. \n\n5\nEvidence that the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control is\na potentially mitigating condition under AG & 20(c). Applicant engaged a credit repair\nservice and now is in a counseling service that is approaching the debts in a sound way\nso the MC is partially applicable.\nAG & 20(d) applies where the evidence shows the individual initiated a good-faith\neffort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. While it not necessary that\nall of the delinquent debts be resolved for mitigation to apply, it is necessary that a\nsignificant portion of the debts be settled or paid. The smaller of two debts has been\nresolved and is mitigated. The larger one can be paid under an agreement, but no\nevidence was offered to show that payments had begun as scheduled despite having\ngiven the Applicant a month to supply such information. \nUnder AG \u00b6 20(e) the security concern may be mitigated when the individual has\na reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-due debt that is the cause of the\nproblem, and provides documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or\nprovides evidence of actions to resolve the issue. He disputed both debts through his\ncredit repair service but later acknowledged their existence and has taken steps to pay\nor settle them.  \nApplicant has not been sufficiently diligent in pursuing the problem until recently.\nThe mitigating conditions are not applicable.\nGuideline E, Personal Conduct\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in\nAG & 15:  \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, and\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout and an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information (AG \u00b6 15).\nConditions that could raise a security concern and be disqualifying include the\ndeliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant and material facts from any\npersonnel security questionnaire (AG \u00b6 16 (a)). Applicant\u2019s failure to report his two\nfinancial delinquencies (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a.-b.) at Question 28 a (Delinquent debts of over 180\ndays), and at Question 28 b (Delinquent debts of over 90 days) on his SF 86, prompted\nsecurity concerns under Guideline E (Personal Conduct).\nThe requirement of the guideline is that the omissions be deliberately false. I\nconclude that they were since the testimony at the hearing by Applicant indicated only\nthat at the time he filed his SF 86 he was working with an agency to have debts removed\nfrom his credit reports, and thought they would be deleted. Yet he knew of the debts and\nthat the agency was working on in a limited manner and not charged with working out\npayments such as his new counseling service is doing. He also admitted that he did not\n\n6\ntake the debt issues as seriously as he should have in regard to the security clearance\nprocess\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the\nmotivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion,\nexploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or\nrecurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a\nsecurity clearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Overall, the record evidence leaves\nme with questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security\nclearance at this time. I recognize his expressed interest to resolve these financial\nissues to restore his credit rating and keep a security clearance. However, these\ndelinquent debts have been his for several years. Even though he has been employed\nat a good salary over the past three years with his present employer, very little was\ndone to resolve these debts until the SOR was issued. Applicant has not mitigated the\nsecurity concerns arising from these financial considerations. Applicant has begun to\nreceive effective debt counseling, and was impressive in his testimony about his family\nand work. Thus, there is no reason that he should not receive a security clearance at\nsome future time. However, it is premature at this time to grant a security clearance.\n                       Formal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F: AGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a.: For Applicant\n      Subparagraph 1.b.: Against Applicant\n\n7\nParagraph 2, Guideline E: AGAINST APPLICANT\n     Subparagraph 2.a.: Against Applicant\nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance. Access to classified information is denied. \nCHARLES D. ABLARD  \nAdministrative Judge\n",

Cervi, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nO\u2019BRIEN, Rita C., Administrative Judge:\nBased upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I\nconclude that Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns raised under the\nguideline for financial considerations. Accordingly, his request for a security clearance is\ndenied.\nOn November 9, 2007, Applicant submitted a Questionnaire for Sensitive\nPositions (SF-86) to request a security clearance required as part of his employment\nwith a defense contractor (Item 5). After reviewing the results of the ensuing\nbackground investigation, adjudicators for the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals\n(DOHA) were unable to make a preliminary affirmative finding  that it is clearly\n1\nconsistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s request. \nNovember 17, 2008\n\n See Directive, Enclosure 3, Section E3.1.7. The FORM included eight documents (Items 1 - 8) proffered in\n2\nsupport of the government\u2019s case.\n2\nOn June 19, 2008, DOHA issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR),\nthat specified the basis for its decision \u2013 security concerns addressed in the Directive\nunder Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of the Revised Adjudicative Guidelines\n(AG).\nApplicant received the SOR (Item 1) on July 3, 2008. He signed his notarized\nAnswer on July 21 2008, in which he admitted to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.c. and 1d. He denied\nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.e. and 1.f. In his Answer, Applicant also requested a decision without a\nhearing. \nOn August 29, 2008, DOHA Department Counsel submitted a file of relevant\nmaterials (FORM)  in support of the government\u2019s preliminary decision. Applicant was\n2\ngiven 30 days to file a response to the FORM, but did not reply. I received the case on\nNovember 5, 2008.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant\u2019s admissions in response to the SOR are admitted as fact. After a\nthorough review of the pleadings, Applicant\u2019s response to the SOR, and the FORM, I\nmake the following additional findings of fact.\nApplicant is 54 years old and employed by a defense contractor. He served in the\nU.S. Army from 1974 to 1977 (Item 5). He is married and has four sons, two of whom\nserve in the military. He attended junior college from 1987 to 1990 and received an\nassociates degree (Item 5). After being steadily employed as an engineering systems\nanalyst from 1998 to 2003, Applicant was laid off. Although he was unemployed for six\nmonths, he could not receive unemployment compensation because he was in a\n\u201cdisability\u201d status with his previous employer. He obtained employment at a temporary\nagency from June 2004 to December 2005, followed by employment as an\nengineer/administrator for approximately one and a half years, until October 2007. He\nwas then hired by a defense contractor (Item 5).\nIn his Interrogatory response dated May 23, 2008 (Item 6), Applicant listed his\ngross monthly income as $5,356, or about $65,000 annually. When his net monthly\nincome of $3,856 and his wife\u2019s net income of $800 are combined, Applicant\u2019s total net\nmonthly income is $4,656. After paying his monthly expenses and debt payments, his\nmonthly net remainder is $1,458 (Item 6).\nApplicant\u2019s credit reports show that he has six debts that became delinquent\nbetween 2005 and 2006 (Items 7 and 8). These debts, listed in the SOR, total $24,492.\nHis judgments in favor of Celink ($8,048) and Credit Union One ($8,079), along with the\n\n Directive. 6.3.\n3\n See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988).\n4\n3\ndebt owed to My Personal Credit Union ($8,144), represent the bulk of his delinquent\ndebt. Of the smaller debts, he denies only the $85 debt to Comcast Cable (Item 4).\nApplicant admits the judgment to Celink (Item 4), which represents the default\njudgment owed on a repossessed van. Applicant states the van was assigned to his ex-\nwife in their divorce (Item 6). As to the debt owed to My Personal Credit Union, he\nstates in his Interrogatory response that is a credit card that was assigned to his wife in\ntheir divorce agreement. However, in his Answer, he states that this debt is a duplicate\nof the Celink debt (Item 4). He provided no documentation to support this contention. \nApplicant also states that he is not liable for the judgment owed to Credit Union\nOne, because his name was removed as a defendant in the case (Item 4). His evidence\nis the court docket. Although the docket lists numerous court actions between April and\nNovember 2006, none indicate that Applicant\u2019s name was removed as a defendant.\nApplicant\u2019s 2007 and 2008 credit bureau reports show he is liable for this debt (Items 7\nand 8). Although he states he is not responsible, he states that he made payments on\nthis debt and reduced the balance to $6,455 (Item 6). Applicant provided no evidence of\nthese payments. \nThe evidence does not include a payment plan for the Celink debt. Applicant\u2019s\nPersonal Financial Statement does not indicate payments being made on any of the\nSOR debts (Item 6). Applicant did not state whether he has attended counseling.\nPolicies\nEach security clearance decision must be a fair, impartial, and commonsense\ndetermination based on examination of all available relevant and material information,\nand consideration of the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in the Revised\nAdjudicative Guidelines (AG).  Decisions must also reflect consideration of the factors\n3\nlisted in \u00b6 2(a) of the Guidelines, commonly referred to as the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept.\nThe presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not\ndeterminative of a conclusion for or against an Applicant. However, specific applicable\nguidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against them as they\nrepresent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to classified\ninformation. In this case, the pleadings and the information presented by the parties\nrequire consideration of the security concerns and adjudicative factors addressed under\nGuideline F (financial considerations) at AG \u00b6 18.\nA security clearance decision is intended only to resolve whether it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest  for an Applicant to either receive or continue to\n4\nhave access to classified information. The government bears the initial burden of\n\n See Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, 531.\n5\n See Egan; Revised Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 2(b).\n6\n4\nproducing admissible information on which it based the preliminary decision to deny or\nrevoke a security clearance for an Applicant. Additionally, the government must be able\nto prove controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If the government meets its burden, it\nthen falls to the Applicant to refute, extenuate or mitigate the government\u2019s case. \nBecause no one has a \u201cright\u201d to a security clearance, an Applicant bears a heavy\nburden of persuasion.  A person who has access to classified information enters into a\n5\nfiduciary relationship with the government based on trust and confidence. Therefore, the\ngovernment has a compelling interest in ensuring each Applicant possesses the\nrequisite judgement, reliability and trustworthiness of one who will protect the national\ninterests as his or her own. The \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard\ncompels resolution of any reasonable doubt about an Applicant\u2019s suitability for access in\nfavor of the government.6\nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nAG \u00b618 expresses the security concern pertaining to financial considerations:\nFailure or inability to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially over-\nextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.\nCompulsive gambling is a concern as it may lead to financial crimes\nincluding espionage. Affluence that cannot be explained by known sources\nof income is also a security concern. It may indicate proceeds from\nfinancially profitable criminal acts.\nBased on the evidence contained in the FORM, the disqualifying conditions AG\n\u00b619 (a) (inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts); and AG \u00b619 (c) (a history of not\nmeeting financial obligations) apply. The credit bureau reports show that Applicant\u2018s\ndebts became delinquent around 2005 and 2006, and they still appear on his 2008\nreports (Items 6 and 7), showing he has a history of failing to meet his financial\nobligations. Applicant denies allegation 1.f., a debt to Comcast Cable, for $85, which\nbecame delinquent about 2005 (Item 7). Although it no longer appears on the 2008\ncredit bureau reports, Applicant offered no documentation showing it has been paid. \nAlthough it is not completely clear from the record why Applicant has failed to pay\nhis debts, he assigns responsibility to his ex-wife for the $16,000 owed to Celink and My\n\n5\nPersonal Credit Union (Item 6). However, his claim is unsubstantiated, because\nApplicant did not provide documentation showing which debts were assigned to each\nparty in the divorce.\nThe following conditions that can potentially mitigate security concerns are\nrelevant: AG \u00b6 20: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under\nsuch circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's\ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the\nperson's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical\nemergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual acted responsibly\nunder the circumstances; \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or\nthere are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control; \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or\notherwise resolve debts; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-due\ndebt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented proof to substantiate\nthe basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions to resolve the issue.\nNone of the relevant mitigating conditions apply. Applicant\u2019s failure to pay his\ndelinquencies did not occur in the distant past, as five of the six debts listed in the SOR\nstill appear in his May 2008 and August 2008 credit reports (Items 6 and 8, respectively)\n(AG \u00b6 20a). The record contains no evidence of financial counseling (AG \u00b6 20c).\nAG \u00b6 20d appears to apply because Applicant claims he made payments on the\nCredit Union One debt (Item 6) and intends to set up payment arrangements on the\nCelink debt (Item 4). However, without evidence to support the Credit Union One\npayments, and with only a promise of future payment on Celink, mitigation is not\navailable under AG \u00b6 20d.\nThe record evidence shows that Applicant disputes his responsibility for the\ndebts owed to Celink Credit Union One, and My Personal Credit Union. He contends\nthat all three are his wife\u2019s responsibility (Item 6). However, he provided no evidence to\nsupport his contention and AG \u00b6 20 (e) cannot be applied.\nMoreover, the conflicting nature of Applicant\u2019s statements undermine his\ncontention that he is not liable for the debts. Applicant shifts responsibility for the Celink\ndebt to his ex-wife (Item 6), but then later accepts his liability by claiming that he is\nmaking arrangements to pay it (Item 4). He states that the My Personal Credit Union\ndebt is his wife\u2019s responsibility, but later claims that it is a duplication of the Celink debt\n\n See Egan; Revised Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 2(b). \n7\n6\n(Item 4). Applicant claims that he is making payments on the Credit Union One debt\n(Item 6), but in his Answer, he states that he has no responsibility for it because his\nname has been removed from the judgment (Item 4). \nAG \u00b6 20 (b) is relevant because the record shows that Applicant experienced\nunemployment and a divorce, both of which can be conditions that are beyond an\nApplicant\u2019s control and may negatively affect finances. Applicant was laid off for\napproximately six months at the end of 2003. He did not receive unemployment\ncompensation, but it appears that he did receive disability payments (Item 5). Without\nfurther information, the extent to which this period of reduced income affected his\nfinances is unclear. It did occur more than four years ago, and the record indicates\nApplicant has been employed since then. The effect of his divorce is also unclear.\nAlthough Applicant blames his ex-wife for being financially irresponsible about\nobligations assigned to her in the divorce (Item 6), the negative effect of the divorce on\nApplicant\u2019s finances cannot be deduced from the record. AG \u00b6 20 (b) does not apply.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate the\nApplicant\u2019s security eligibility by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s conduct and\nall the circumstances. I have evaluated the facts presented and have applied the\nappropriate adjudicative factors under the cited Guideline. I have also reviewed the\nrecord before me in the context of the whole-person factors listed in AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which\nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and\nother permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct;\n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the\nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nApplicant is 54 years old and presumed to be a mature, responsible adult. He\nhas accrued significant debt over the past several years. In response to the\ngovernment\u2019s concerns about his delinquencies, he offered little in the way of mitigation\nor resolution. Absent such information, the record presents no evidence sufficient to\novercome the government\u2019s security concerns. A fair and common-sense assessment\nof the available information bearing on Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance\nshows he has not satisfied the doubts about his ability or willingness to protect the\ngovernment\u2019s interests. Because protection of the national interest is paramount in\nthese determinations, such doubts must be resolved in favor of the government.7\nFormal Findings\n\n7\nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by section\nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are as follows:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the foregoing, it is not clearly consistent with the national interest\nto allow Applicant access to classified information.

The action was taken \nunder Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \n(February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President \non December 29, 2005.  \n \nMarch 4, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on October 11, 2008, and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge. Department Counsel was ready to proceed on \nNovember 24, 2008, and the case was assigned an administrative judge on the same \nday. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on December 15, 2008, scheduling the hearing \nfor 9:00 a.m. on January 14, 2009. Applicant arrived for the hearing at about 11:20 a.m., \nbecause she mistakenly thought the hearing was scheduled for the following day until \nshe was contacted about her failure to appear at 9:00 a.m. The administrative judge \ncontinued the case until a date to be determined.1  \n \nThe case was reassigned to me on January 21, 2009. DOHA issued an amended \nnotice of hearing on January 23, 2009, scheduling the hearing for February 2, 2009. I \nconvened the hearing as scheduled. Government Exhibits (GX) 1 through 14 were \nadmitted in evidence without objection. Applicant testified on her own behalf and \nsubmitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AX) A through G, which were admitted without objection. \nI granted Applicant\u2019s request to keep the record open until February 20, 2009, to enable \nher to submit additional documentary evidence. She timely submitted AX H through P, \nwhich were admitted without objection (Hearing Exhibit I). DOHA received transcript \n(Tr.) on February 13, 2009. The record closed on February 20, 2009. \n \nProcedural and Evidentiary Rulings \n \nHearing Notice \n \n \nApplicant was given the required 15-day notice for the hearing originally \nscheduled for January 14, 2009; however, the amended notice of hearing was issued \nless than 15 days before the hearing on February 2, 2009. The parties agreed that the \nFebruary 2 hearing was a continuation of the January 14 hearing, and Applicant agreed \ncontinue the proceedings on February 2, 2009 (Tr. 20-21). \n \nUncharged Misconduct \n \n \nApplicant objected to evidence that she failed to disclose an unsatisfied judgment \nwhen she executed an application for sensitive positions (SF 85P) in 1994, asserting \nthat it was irrelevant and unfair (Tr. 83, 89). Department counsel had informed Applicant \nof his intention to offer the SF 85P and a credit report reflecting an unpaid judgment (GX \n13).  \n \nConduct not alleged in the SOR may be considered to assess an applicant=s \ncredibility; to evaluate evidence of extenuation, mitigation, or changed circumstances; to \nconsider whether an applicant has demonstrated successful rehabilitation; or in the \nwhole person analysis. ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006). I \noverruled Applicant\u2019s objection and admitted the SF 85P and credit report for the limited \npurposes of considering whether Applicant had a pattern of delinquent debts as early as \n                                                          \n1  A one-page transcript of this hearing was prepared, but it will not be referenced in this decision. \n\n \n3 \n \n \n1994 and whether she had a pattern of concealing debts on her security clearance \napplications (Tr. 84-85, 88). \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn her answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted all the allegations in SOR with \nexplanations. Her admissions in her answer and at the hearing are incorporated in my \nfindings of fact.  \n \n \nApplicant is a 39-year-old data base administrator employed by a defense \ncontractor. She has worked for her current employer since September 2004. Two \ncolleagues describe her as dependable, dedicated, security conscious, and loyal (AX \nG). One of her colleagues has worked with her at their church for two years and noted \nher commitment and devotion to her family (AX G at 1). \n \nApplicant served on active duty in the U.S. Army from February 1988 to February \n1996. While in the Army, she worked as an information systems analyst (Tr. 10). She \nreceived a top secret clearance in February 1988, but she does not currently hold a \nclearance (Tr. 9-10).  \n \n \nApplicant was married in August 1990 and divorced in July 1992. She remarried \nher former spouse in February 2004. She has four children, ages 20, 16, 14, and 7. \n \n \nApplicant has an associate\u2019s degree in information technology, a bachelor\u2019s \ndegree in organizational management, and is currently working on her master\u2019s degree. \nShe testified she is about 12 credits and one year away from obtaining her master\u2019s \ndegree (Tr. 9). \n \n \nOn April 6, 2001, Applicant filed a petition for Chapter 13 bankruptcy solely in her \nname, listing liabilities of about $116,309 and assets of $82,950. The debts listed in her \nbankruptcy petition included numerous delinquent credit card accounts, a deficiency \nfrom a car repossession, and student loans. Her assets included a house and lot worth \n$55,000 and a time share in a vacation resort worth $13,000. Her case was dismissed \non February 8, 2002 for failure to make payments (GX 4).  \n \nWhen Applicant filed her bankruptcy petition, she was the mother of three \nchildren and pregnant with twins. Her doctor prescribed bed rest in late June 2001. She \ndid not return to work until after the babies were delivered in December 2001. One of \nthe twins died shortly after birth. Her income stopped in June 2001 and she was unable \nto make the payments required by the bankruptcy court. She had not worked for her \nemployer long enough to have any benefits (Tr. 36-37).  \n \n \nIn 2002, Applicant moved to another location and was unemployed until March \n2003, when she found part-time employment at a bank (Tr. 37). She and her former \nspouse reconciled. Her former spouse had serious financial problems, with outstanding \n\n \n4 \n \n \nstudent loans, a deficiency from a car repossession, and delinquent credit cards. They \nremarried in February 2004. \n \nMarch 26, 2004, Applicant and her spouse filed a petition for Chapter 13 \nbankruptcy, listing liabilities of about $102,656 and assets of $68,213. Applicant testified \nthat most of the delinquent debts were her husband\u2019s, but his bankruptcy lawyer \nadvised that they file a joint bankruptcy so that it would not appear that her husband \nwas hiding assets (Tr. 38-39). The case was dismissed on July 22, 2004, for failure to \ncommence payments (Tr. 37-39; GX 5). \n \n \nOn August 6, 2004, Applicant and her spouse filed a petition for Chapter 13 \nbankruptcy, listing liabilities of about $116,283 and assets of $68,053. The case was \ndismissed on January 5, 2005 for failure to appear at the creditor\u2019s meeting and failure \nto make payments (GX 6). \n \n \nOn March 31, 2005, Applicant filed a petition for Chapter 13 bankruptcy solely in \nher name, listing liabilities of about $101,812 and assets of $61,250. On September 15, \n2005, the case was dismissed for failure to make payments (GX 7). Applicant testified \nshe did not make the payments because she was unable to work for a substantial \nperiod of time as a result of a highly contagious infection (Tr. 41). Her testimony was \ncorroborated by medical records reflecting treatment from July 2005 to July 2006 (AX \nC). \n \n \nOn October 14, 2005, Applicant again filed a petition for Chapter 13 bankruptcy \nsolely in her name, listing liabilities of about $109,712 and assets of $66,050. The case \nwas dismissed with prejudice on February 21, 2006, for failure to commence payments. \nShe was prohibited from refilling within 180 days (GX 8). Applicant testified she was still \nsuffering from the infection and unable to work. The tenants in her rental property \nrefused to pay rent once they learned about her bankruptcy, and the house was in \ndanger of being foreclosed.  \n \n \nOn April 27, 2006, Applicant again filed a petition for Chapter 13 bankruptcy \nsolely in her name, in an effort to prevent foreclosure on her rental property (Tr. 43). \nUnlike her previous petitions, where she was represented by a bankruptcy attorney, she \nfiled this petition pro se. On May 18, 2006, the case was dismissed based on the prior \ndismissal with prejudice (GX 9). \n \n \nIn August 2006, Applicant\u2019s elderly mother moved in with them. In November \n2006, her brother suffered a stroke and also moved in with them (Tr. 41-43, 57). In \nSeptember 2007, Applicant completed a monthly cash flow worksheet tracking her \nexpenses for four weeks. There is a notation at the bottom of the worksheet, \u201cNot \nenough income!!\u201d Loan consolidation and Chapter 7 bankruptcy are handwritten on the \nworksheet as options (AX N). \n \n \nOn January 4, 2008, Applicant filed a petition for Chapter 7 bankruptcy solely in \nher name, listing liabilities of about $138,607 and assets of $19,476. By this time, the \n\n \n5 \n \n \nrental home had been foreclosed and a car repossessed (Tr. 44). Her debts were \ndischarged on April 21, 2008 (GX 10). Before filing the petition, Applicant was \ncontributing about $335 per month to her 401k retirement account (Tr. 48). The debts \ndischarged included a judgment on a delinquent car loan for $13,000 and a $1,000 \npersonal loan, a $6,000 debt for furniture, a number of overdrawn checks, payday \nloans, and start-up costs and operating expenses for a telemarketing business \nApplicant operated from her home (Tr. 51-55). She and her spouse also incurred about \n$15,000 in landscaping expenses for the house they were renting, because they hoped \nto buy the house. Their low credit scores prevented them from being able to buy the \nhouse (Tr. 54).  \n \n \nApplicant currently has two credit cards with small balances, which she pays off \nevery month. Her spouse has none (Tr. 45-46). She has a 12-year-old car that is paid \nfor, and her spouse has a five-year-old car on which he is making payments (Tr. 47). \nAfter the Chapter 7 bankruptcy, Applicant and her spouse have kept their accounts \nseparate, except for the rent and utilities, which they share (Tr. 47).  \n \nIn addition to the mandatory counseling required by the bankruptcy court, \nApplicant has received financial counseling from her credit union (Tr. 50). She \ncompleted a three-day debt management course in April 2007 (AX P). She is keeping a \nbudget that was designed by her credit union that reflects a net monthly remainder of \nabout $378 for spending and savings (Tr. 50; AX L at 3). Among other items, the budget \nincludes two $20,000 student loans, on one of which she has budgeted payments of \n$50 per month. The other student loan is in a deferred status (AX P at 3).  \n \nApplicant and her spouse have moved into a smaller house, reducing their \nmonthly rent from $1,750 to $1,350 (Tr. 65; AX L at 1). The now have only one cell \nphone, and they have reduced their cable service (Tr. 65). Applicant\u2019s credit union \nstatement for the month of January 2009 reflects a balance of $15.14 in one share \naccount, a balance of $2,505.11 in a second share account, a zero balance in her \n\u201cquick cash loan\u201d account, and an end-of-month balance of $721.28 in her checking \naccount (AX O). As of August 2008, she was earning $24.36 per hour. She had earned \n$49,880 in the previous year (AX D). Her credit reports for January 2009 reflect that she \nis current on all obligations (AX E and F). \n \n \nWhen Applicant submitted her SF 86 in February 2007, she answered \u201cyes\u201d to \nquestion 27a, asking if she had filed for bankruptcy during the past seven years. The \ncomputer printout of the data entries on her SF 86 reflects the bankruptcy petition filed \nin March 2004 (GX 5), but it does not reflect her other bankruptcy petitions (GX 1 at 9). \nShe answered \u201cno\u201d to questions 23a through 23f, asking about her police record. The \ncomputer printout of her SF 86 does not reflect her arrest in February 2001 for driving \nunder a suspended license and resisting arrest, nor does it reflect that she was charged \nwith passing a fraudulent check in March 2003 (GX 1 at 8; AX B). Applicant testified that \nwhen she asked her security office why some of the information was not listed in the \nelectronic printout of her SF 86, one of the security specialists told her the disk was \ncorrupted (Tr. 74). \n\n \n6 \n \n \n \n \nAt the hearing, Applicant insisted she disclosed all her bankruptcies when she \nsubmitted her SF 86 (Tr. 66). After the hearing, she produced an EPSQ SF 86 \nworksheet on which she answered \u201cyes\u201d to the bankruptcy question and listed the filing \ndate as \u201c2001/04/06.\u201d This entry could indicate bankruptcies filed in 2001, 2004, and \n2006; however, it appears to reflect the precise date of her first Chapter 13 bankruptcy \npetition, which was filed on April 6, 2001.  \n \nApplicant also listed the details of the two bankruptcy filings in 2004 under the \ngeneral remarks section of her worksheet (AX M at 27-28). She did not list her petitions \nfiled in 2005 or 2006. The 2004 filings were at the very bottom of the last page of the \nworksheet, suggesting the possibility of a continuation sheet, but no continuation sheet \nwas included in her post-hearing submission. In the general remarks section (AX M at \n28), she commented, \u201cI have experienced some financial struggles in the past but have \nobtained better employment.\u201d Her Chapter 7 bankruptcy was filed after she submitted \nher SF 86. \n \nApplicant listed the bad check offense on her worksheet under the question \nabout other offenses not covered elsewhere (AX M at 24). The conviction of driving with \na suspended license and the charge of resisting arrest are also listed on the worksheet \n(AX M at 23). She testified that when she gave the worksheet to her security officer, he \ntold her not to list the conviction of resisting arrest because it was a traffic offense \nrelated to charge of driving under a suspended license (Tr. 68-71). \n \n \nIn November 2008, Department Counsel sent Applicant a blank SF 86 and \ninformed her he intended to present it at the hearing (GX 14). At the hearing, she \nsubmitted a SF 86 bearing her signature and dated December 13, 2008 (AX A). She \ntestified it was \u201cthe one from 2006,\u201d but it appears to have been filled out after she \nreceived the blank SF 86 from Department Counsel (Tr. 30). On this SF 86, she \nanswered \u201cyes\u201d to the question whether she had ever been charged with or convicted of \na felony, even though all the offenses on her criminal record are misdemeanors (AX A \nat 7; AX B). She also answered \u201cyes\u201d to the questions regarding bankruptcies, \ngarnishments, repossessions and debts more than 180 days delinquent (AX A at 8-9). \nShe also testified that AX A did not include the \u201cback sheet\u201d listing all her bankruptcies. \n \n \nIn rebuttal, Department Counsel presented a SF 85P certified by Applicant on \nJanuary 29, 1994 and recertified on February 15, 1994, on which she answered \u201cno\u201d to \nthe question, \u201cIn the last 5 years, have you, or a company over which you exercised \nsome control, filed for bankruptcy, been declared bankrupt, been subject to a tax lien, or \nhad legal judgment rendered against you for a debt?\u201d She also answered \u201cno\u201d to a \nquestion asking if she was over 180 days delinquent on any loan or financial obligation \n(GX 11 at 9). Department counsel presented a credit report dated April 6, 1994, \nreflecting an unpaid judgment for a telephone bill for $795 that was entered against \nApplicant in June 1990 (GX 12 at 2).  \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \nApplicant testified she did not know a judgment had been entered against her \nwhen she completed the 1994 application (Tr. 80). She stated she did not know why \nshe did not disclose the delinquent telephone bill on her 1994 application (Tr. 80-81). \n \nPolicies \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \ncontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.   \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not \ninflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common \nsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no \nsense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. Or. \n10865 \u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is not necessarily a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  It is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \n \n \nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \n\n \n8 \n \n \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).   \n \n \nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity \nclearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 \nU.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \n \nThe SOR alleges between April 2001 and April 2006, Applicant filed four Chapter \n13 bankruptcy petitions that were dismissed for non-payment (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 1.d, and \n1.e), one petition that was dismissed for non-payment and failure to appear at the \ncreditor\u2019s meeting (SOR \u00b6 1.c), and one petition that was dismissed because it was filed \nwithin 180 days of an earlier dismissal (SOR \u00b6 1.f). It also alleges she filed a Chapter 7 \nbankruptcy in January 2008 and received a discharge in April 2008 (SOR \u00b6 1.g).  \n \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18 as follows:  \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds. \n \nSeveral disqualifying conditions under this guideline could raise a security \nconcern and may be disqualifying in this case. AG \u00b6 19(a) is raised where there is an \nAinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts.@ AG \u00b6 19(b) is a two-pronged condition that is \nraised where there is Aindebtedness caused by frivolous or irresponsible spending and \nthe absence of any evidence of willingness or intent to pay the debt or establish a \nrealistic plan to pay the debt.@ AG \u00b6 19(c) is raised when there is Aa history of not \nmeeting financial obligations.@ AG \u00b6 19(e) is raised when there is Aconsistent spending \nbeyond one=s means, which may be indicated by excessive indebtedness, significant \nnegative cash flow, high debt-to-income ratio, and/or other financial analysis.@ \n \nApplicant\u2019s financial history establishes all these disqualifying conditions, shifting \nthe burden to her to produce evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, and \n\n \n9 \n \n \nthe burden of disproving it never shifts to the government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \n \nSecurity concerns based on financial problems can be mitigated by showing that \nAthe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual=s \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ AG \u00b6 20(a). This is a compound \nmitigating condition, with three disjunctive prongs and one conjunctive prong. If any of \nthe three disjunctive prongs are established, the mitigating condition is not fully \nestablished unless the conduct Adoes not cast doubt on the individual=s current \nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d Applicant\u2019s debts were recent, numerous, \nand did not occur \u201cunder such circumstances that [they are] unlikely to recur.\u201d \nFurthermore, her financial history casts doubt on her good judgment. Thus, I conclude \nAG \u00b6 20(a) is not established. \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing that Athe \nconditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person=s \ncontrol (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical \nemergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual acted responsibly \nunder the circumstances.@ AG \u00b6 20(b). Both prongs, i.e., conditions beyond the person=s \ncontrol and responsible conduct, must be established. Applicant has encountered \nseveral conditions beyond her control. She was divorced in 1992. When she reconciled \nwith her husband and they were remarried, her husband brought considerable debt to \nthe marriage. She was incapacitated from June to December 2001 while awaiting the \nbirth of twins. She suffered from a highly contagious infection from July 2005 to July \n2006. She became responsible for an elderly mother and disabled brother in late 2006. \nHer telemarketing business failed in 2007. However, she did not act responsibly. She \nspent beyond her means, incurred irresponsible expenses such as an expensive \nlandscaping for a home that they did not own, obtained expensive payday loans, and \nfailed to attend the creditor\u2019s meeting required by the bankruptcy court on one occasion. \nI conclude AG \u00b6 20(b) is not established. \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing that Athe \nperson has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear \nindications that the problem is being resolved or is under control.@ AG \u00b6 20(c). Applicant \ncompleted a debt management course, received financial counseling through her credit \nunion, adopted a reasonable budget, and is current on her obligations. Her financial \nsituation is precarious, but it is under control. I conclude AG \u00b6 20(c) is established. \n \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing that Athe \nindividual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve \ndebts.@ AG \u00b6 20(d). Good faith means acting in a way that shows reasonableness, \nprudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation. ISCR Case No. 99-0201, 1999 \nWL 1442346 at *4 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 1999). Bankruptcy is a legitimate means of \nresolving excessive indebtedness, but it does in itself not establish a good faith effort. It \nis appropriate to consider the actions that led to the delinquent debts and Applicant\u2019s \n\n \n10 \n \n \nfailure to address them before resorting to bankruptcy. ISCR Case No. 01-26675 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Jun.13, 2003). Applicant presented no evidence of actions to resolve her \ndebts before resorting to bankruptcy. I conclude AG \u00b6 20(d) is not established. \n \n \nEven though the mitigating condition in AG \u00b6 20(c) applies, I conclude the \nsecurity concerns based on financial considerations are not mitigated because this one \nmitigating factor is outweighed by Applicant\u2019s extensive track record of delinquent debts \nand bankruptcy filings. \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \nThe SOR alleges Applicant falsified her SF 86 by disclosing only one of her \nbankruptcy filings (SOR \u00b6 2.a), and by not disclosing a misdemeanor arrest and \nconviction in February 2001 and a misdemeanor bad check charge in March 2003 (SOR \n\u00b6 2.b). The concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 15 as follows:  \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.   \nThe relevant disqualifying condition in this case is set out in AG \u00b6 16(a) as follows: \n \ndeliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities.  \n \n \nWhen a falsification allegation is controverted, as in this case, the government \nhas the burden of proving it. An omission, standing alone, does not prove an applicant\u2019s \nstate of mind when the omission occurred. An administrative judge must consider the \nrecord evidence as a whole to determine whether there is direct or circumstantial \nevidence concerning an applicant\u2019s state of mind at the time of the omission.  See ISCR \nCase No. 03-09483 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 17, 2004).  \n \n \nThe government\u2019s evidence is a computer printout of the data extracted from \nApplicant\u2019s SF 86. Applicant\u2019s certification is attached to the computer printout, not the \noriginal questionnaire. Whether Applicant carefully reviewed her application before it \nwas submitted is unclear. She appears, however, to have difficulty with the printed \nword, as evidenced by her misreading of the original hearing notice in this case and her \nadmission of a felony arrest on the blank SF 86 sent to her by Department Counsel. To \ncorroborate her testimony that she disclosed all her bankruptcies, she produced her \n\n \n11 \n \n \nhandwritten EPSQ SF 86 worksheet that listed three bankruptcies instead of the single \nbankruptcy reflected on the computer printout of the data entries on her SF 86. The \nworksheet appears genuine and there is no evidence suggesting it was fabricated. \nApplicant repeatedly testified about a \u201cback page\u201d of her application listing all her \nbankruptcy petitions. I am satisfied that she disclosed her multiple bankruptcies as best \nshe could, but somewhere in the process some of the information was lost. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s EPSQ SF 86 worksheet also disclosed her two misdemeanor arrests \nin February 2001 and March 2003. She received bad advice from her security officer \nwhen he told her the February 2001 charge of resisting arrest was a traffic offense that \nwas not covered by the questionnaire. She characterized one of her offenses as more \nserious than it was, listing it as a felony. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s testimony on the falsification issue was candid, plausible, and \ncredible. She appeared baffled by the accusation that she falsified her application, and \nher worksheet corroborates her insistence that the computer printout omitted \ninformation from her SF 86. I am satisfied she did not intentionally falsify her SF 86, and \nI conclude AG \u00b6 16(a) is refuted by the evidence.2 No other disqualifying conditions \nunder this guideline are raised. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline F and E in my whole person analysis. Some of the factors in \nAG \u00b6 2(a) were addressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional \ncomment. \n                                                          \n2  Even if I had concluded that AG \u00b6 16(a) was not refuted, I would have resolved the personal conduct \nconcerns in Applicant\u2019s favor, based on the mitigating conditions in AG \u00b6 17(b) (\u201comission or concealment \nwas caused or significantly contributed to by improper or inadequate advice of authorized personnel\u201d) and \nAG \u00b6 17(f) (\u201cthe information was unsubstantiated\u201d).  \n\n \n12 \n \n \n \n \nApplicant is an intelligent, well-educated adult. She was candid, sincere, and \ncredible at the hearing. Her expertise is in data base management, not financial \nmanagement, and she is unfamiliar with the arcane world of security clearance \ndeterminations. She has been dealing with delinquent debts for most of her adult life, \nbeginning while she was on active duty in the Army.  \n \n \nApplicant has made a number of good decisions during the past year. She \nstarted tracking her spending habits, obtained a Chapter 7 bankruptcy discharge, \nseparated her finances from her husband\u2019s, obtained financial counseling, and adopted \na reasonable budget. She has a good income and is living modestly. What is missing is \na track record of financial responsibility long enough to demonstrate that she will not fall \nback into old habits. Less than a year has passed since her bankruptcy discharge. More \ntime is needed for her to demonstrate that she is willing and able to be financially \nresponsible.  \n \n \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline F and \nE, and evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude \nApplicant has refuted the allegations of falsification under Guideline E, but she has not \nmitigated the security concerns under Guideline F. Accordingly, I conclude she has not \ncarried her burden of showing that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to \ngrant her eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nI make the following formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set \nforth in the SOR, as required by Directive \u00b6 E3.1.25: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): AGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.g: \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E (Personal Conduct):  \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.b: \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to \nclassified information is denied. \n \n \n \nLeRoy F. Foreman \nAdministrative Judge \n",

(Government Exhibit 1).  On July 25, 2008, the Defense Office of\nHearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the\nsecurity concerns under Guideline B for Applicant.  The action was taken under\nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February\n20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial\nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended\n(Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President\non December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs\nissued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on August 11, 2008, and requested a\nhearing before an Administrative Judge.  The case was assigned to this Administrative\nJudge on September 23, 2008.   A notice of hearing was issued on September 30,\n2008, and the hearing was held on October 28, 2008. The Government presented two\nexhibits, referred to as Government Exhibits 1 and 2,  which were received without\nobjection.  Applicant presented four exhibits, referred to as Applicant\u2019s Exhibits A\nthrough D, which were received without objection.  The Applicant testified on his own\nbehalf.  DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on November 6, 2008.  Based\n\n2\nupon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to\nclassified information is granted.\nRequest for Administrative Notice\nDepartment Counsel submitted a formal request that I take administrative notice\nof certain facts concerning the current political conditions in Syria.  Applicant had no\nobjection.  (Tr. p. 16 ).  The request and the attached documents were not admitted into\nevidence, but were included in the record. The facts administratively noticed are set out\nin the Findings of Fact, below. \nFINDINGS OF FACT\nThe following Findings of Fact are based on Applicant's Answer to the SOR, the\ntestimony and the exhibits.  The Applicant is 49 years of age and a widower.  He was\nemployed as a translator/linguist or interpreter for a defense contractor.  He is currently\nin a temporary position as an IT consultant.  He seeks a security clearance in\nconnection with his employment in the defense industry.\nParagraph 1 (Guideline B - Foreign Influence).  The Government alleges in this\nparagraph that the Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he has foreign contacts\nthat could create the potential for foreign influence that could result in the compromise\nof classified information.\nThe Applicant was born in Aleppo, Syria in 1959 to Syrian parents.  He lived in\nSyria until he was twenty eight years old.  From January 1980 to March 1984, the\nApplicant completed his mandatory four year service in the Syrian Army where he\nserved as a kitchen chef.  He explained that all males between the ages of nineteen and\nforty must complete mandatory military service in Syria.  Failure to serve results in\nincarcerations and torture.  After completing his military service, he worked in a machine\nshop in Syria.  Other than his mandatory military service, he has had no associations\nwith the Syrian government.  \nIn 1988, with a desire to leave Syria for good, he applied for and was granted a\nvisa.  That same year, he came to the United States with intentions to make it his\npermanent home.  He has no loyalty to his old country, and no intent to ever go back.\nHe became a naturalized United States citizen in April 25, 2003.  He has never\nconsidered himself to be a dual citizen.  He returned his Syrian passport to the Syrian\nEmbassy, and holds only a United States passport.  (Tr. p. 28).  \nIn the United States, he worked as a mechanic until 1996.  In 1994, he met a\nnative born American woman at a friend\u2019s party, they started dating, and in 1995, he\nmarried her.  In 2001, he started learning the computer.   \nThe Applicant speaks four arabic dialects.  In 2003, the Applicant saw that there\nwas a need for qualified translators to help the United States Army.  He applied for the\njob and within ten days was in Baghdad.  He has been used by the United States Army\nand the Marines to interrogate prisoners in Iraq and Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.  He was\n\n3\nassigned to work for an Army unit where he worked for about four and a half months.\nHe was a Category 2 interpreter, which means that he is a United States citizen.  In\nFebruary 2004, Applicant was transferred to GITMO and underwent a polygraph as a\npart of his job requirement.  He then served as a translator and linquist for the\nInterrogator Joint Task Force (JTF) for fifteen months.  Applicant stated that the\ndetainees hate the interpreters.  This did not bother the Applicant, as he was committed\nto his job for the United States.  In May 2005, Applicant\u2019s wife was diagnosed with colon\ncancer so the Applicant resigned from his position to return to the United States to help\nher through chemotherapy.  \nIn January 2006, the Applicant accepted a position of recruiting manager for a\ntranslation company located near his home.  His duties were to recruit linguists to\nsupport the United States military mission in Iraq and Afghanistan.  The Applicant also\nparticipated in special projects to educate troops about the Arab culture and language\nbefore being deployed overseas.  In February 2006, Applicant\u2019s wife passed away.\nApplicant indicates that there is now a job opportunity as a translator that presents itself\nin Florida that he would like to accept but he needs a security clearance in order to do\nso.  \nThe Applicant has two brothers and two sisters who are citizens and residents of\nSyria.  His parents are deceased.  One of his brothers is a retired fabric worker, who is\n70 years old, the other is a high school teacher.  The Applicant has limited contact with\nhis brothers in Syria.  He speaks to his brother, the retired fabric worker, about once a\nyear.  He speaks to his other brother, the high school teacher, about once every six\nmonths or so.  His brothers are happy for him that he is able to live in the United States.\nThe Applicant\u2019s contact with his sisters is also equally as infrequent.  His sisters are\nboth housewives and married.  One of his sister\u2019s husbands is a fabric worker.  The\nother sister\u2019s husband runs a tree farm.  The Applicant contacts his sister, who is\nmarried to the fabric worker about once a year.  He contacts his other sister about once\nevery five or six months.  They do not know what the Applicant does for a living and the\nApplicant has no intentions of telling them.  Applicant does not tell them because he\ndoes not want to jeopardize their lives or his own life.  \nApplicant testified that he would never compromise the security of the United\nStates or a member of the Armed service for any family member in Syria.  Coming from\na country that is a dictatorship, he is extremely grateful to the United States for the\nfreedoms afforded him that include a better future and a secure life.  (Tr. p. 40).\nApplicant was asked the following hypothetical question by Department Counsel: \u201cLet\u2019s\njust say somehow they found out, and they wanted you to turn over some information\nabout the United States army and they threatened your brother and sisters\u2013 what would\nyou do?\u201d  Applicant replied. \u201cIn by dead body\u201d.  \u201cHow about if they wanted you to pass\nsome information to prisoners in Gitmo?\u201d  Applicant replied, \u201cThat is not going to\nhappen.\u201d  \u201cSo, you would be willing to---\u201c  Applicant replied, \u201cTo sacrifice my brother or\nsister for my loyalty to this country.\u201d  (Tr. p. 39).       \nSince living in the United States, the Applicant has traveled to Syria on two\noccasions.  In 1996, he traveled to Syria to attend his brother\u2019s wedding.  At that time,\nhe worked in the IT business.  In 2004, he traveled to Syria to visit his terminally ill\n\n4\nmother who died four days after he arrived.  He obtained permission from JTF to make\nthis trip. \nThe Applicant has no other family, in-laws or associates outside of the United\nStates.  All of the Applicant\u2019s financial assets are located in the United States.  He has\nno assets in Syria.  \nApplicant received three Certificates of Achievement from the Commander of his\nunit.  They are in recognition of his service with honor and distinction in the performance\nof his duties for the Department of Defense.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit A).\n \nApplicant\u2019s performance reviews as a linguist began in September 2004 with\nratings of \u201caverage\u201d and \u201cabove average\u201d.  In December 2004, his performance review\nreflected  \u201coutstanding\u201d ratings in every category.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit C). \nA letter from Applicant\u2019s previous employer dated September 29, 2006, indicates\nthat he has played an essential role in pre-deployment training and translation for the\nUnited States Army, the Naval Criminal Investigative Service, the Air Force Office of\nSpecial Investigations, in support of Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi\nFreedom.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit B)\nA letter from a Marine Corps veteran and a federal civil service employee of the\nDepartment of Defense, dated May 26, 2003, who is also the Applicant\u2019s apartment\nmanager indicates that the Applicant is a person of integrity, honesty and good\njudgment.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit D).\n \nIt is appropriate to discuss the relationship between the United States and Syria.\nSyria, since March 1963, has been ruled by an authoritarian regime.  Syria is currently\nincluded on the Department of State\u2019s list of State Sponsors of Terrorism due to the\npresence of several terrorist groups in Syria.  According to the Department of State, the\nSyrian Government continues to provide political and material support to Hezbollah and\nPalestinian terrorist groups.  Several terrorist groups base their external leadership and\nmaintain offices in Damascus.  In addition Syria permits Iran to transfer weapons and\nsupplies through Syria to Hezbollah in Lebanon.  United States officials criticized Syria\nfor permitting shipments of arms from Iran to Hezbollah in Lebanon that fueled the\nconflict between Lebanon and Israel in July 2006.  Similarly, Syria is \u201cone of the primary\ntransit points for foreign fighters entering Iraq.\u201d  The preliminary findings of a UN\ninvestigation have indicated that the Syrian Government was involved in the February\n2005 assassination of former Lebanese Prime Minister Hariri, who actively opposed\nSyria\u2019s influence on Lebanese political affairs.  A travel warning is in effect for Syria\nfollowing September 12, 2006, attacks on the United States Embassy in Damascus.  In\n1998 and 2000, mobs in Damascus attacked the United States Ambassador\u2019s\nResidence and the United States Embassy respectively.  Due to Syria\u2019s active and\npassive support of terrorism in the Middle East, President Bush signed an executive\norder implementing sanctions on May 11, 2004.  These sanctions prohibit the export to\nSyria of products of the United States other than food or medicine, and prohibit any\ncommercial aircraft owned or controlled by the Syrian Government from taking off from\nor landing in the United States.  The Department of State describes the Syrian\nGovernment\u2019s human rights record as \u201cworsened.\u201d  The following human rights abuses\n\n5\nhave been documented by the State Department as occurring in Syria: absence of right\nto change government, arbitrary or unlawful deprivation of life, torture in prison, poor\nprison conditions, arbitrary arrests and detentions, absence of rule of law, severely\nrestricted civil liberties, limited freedom of religion, government corruption and lack of\ntransparency, and violence against women.  \nPOLICIES\nSecurity clearance decisions are not made in a vacuum.  Accordingly, the\nDepartment of Defense, in Enclosure 2 of the 1992  Directive sets forth policy factors\nand conditions that could raise or mitigate a security concern; which must be given\nbinding consideration in making security clearance determinations.  These factors\nshould be followed in every case according to the pertinent criterion.  However, the\nconditions are neither automatically determinative of the decision in any case, nor can\nthey supersede the Administrative Judge\u2019s reliance on her own common sense.\nBecause each security clearance case presents its own unique facts and\ncircumstances, it cannot be assumed that these factors exhaust the realm of human\nexperience, or apply equally in every  case.  Based on the Findings of Fact set forth\nabove, the factors most applicable to the evaluation of this case are:\nForeign Influence\n6.  The Concern.  Foreign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the\nindividual has divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or\ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way that is not\nin U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by any foreign interest.\nAdjudication under this Guideline can and should consider the identity of the foreign\ncountry in which the foreign contact or financial interest is located, including, but not\nlimited to, such considerations as whether the foreign country is known to target United\nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a risk of\nterrorism. \nConditions that could raise a security concern:\n7.  (a) contact with a foreign family member, business or professional associate,\nfriend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident of a foreign country if that contact\ncreates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or\ncoercion; \n7.  (b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that create\na potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to protect sensitive\ninformation or technology and the individual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person, group, or\ncountry by providing that information.  \n\n6\nConditions that could mitigate security concerns:\n8.  (a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which\nthese persons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in that country\nare such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a position of having to choose\nbetween the interests of a foreign individual, group, organization, or government and the\ninterests of the U.S.;\n8.  (b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of\nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country is so minimal,\nor the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in the U.S.,\nthat the individual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S\ninterest;\n8.  (c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and infrequent\nthat there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign influence or exploitation.\n8.  (d) the foreign contacts and activities are on U.S. Government business or are\napproved by the cognizant security authority.\nIn addition, as set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive at pages 16-17, in\nevaluating the relevance of an individual\u2019s conduct, the Administrative Judge should\nconsider the following general factors:\na.  The nature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding circumstances\nb.  The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation\n \nc.  The frequency and recency of the conduct\nd.  The individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct\ne.  The voluntariness of participation\nf.  The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavior\nchanges\ng.  The motivation for the conduct \nh. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress\n \ni.  The likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nThe eligibility criteria established in the DoD Directive identify personal\ncharacteristics and conduct which are reasonably related to the ultimate question,\nposed in Section 2 of Executive Order 10865, of whether it is \u201cclearly consistent with the\nnational interest\u201d to grant an Applicant\u2019s request for access to classified information.\n\n7\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nThe DoD Directive states, \u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a\nsufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the person is\neligible for a security clearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is\npredicted upon the individual meeting these personnel security guidelines.  The\nadjudicative process is the careful weighing of a number of variables known as the\nwhole person concept.  Available, reliable information about the person, past and\npresent, favorable and unfavorable should be considered in reaching a determination.\u201d \nThe Administrative Judge can draw only those inferences or conclusions that have\nreasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record.  The Judge cannot draw\ninferences or conclusions based on evidence which is speculative or conjectural in\nnature.  Finally, as emphasized by President Eisenhower in Executive Order 10865,\n\u201cAny determination under this order . . . shall be a determination in terms of the national\ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the Applicant\nconcerned.\u201d\nThe Government must make out a case under Guideline B (foreign influence)\nthat establishes doubt about a person's judgment, reliability and trustworthiness.  While\na rational connection, or nexus, must be shown between Applicant's adverse conduct\nand his ability to effectively safeguard classified information, with respect to sufficiency\nof proof of a rational connection, objective or direct evidence is not required.\nThen, the Applicant must remove that doubt with substantial evidence in\nrefutation, explanation, mitigation or extenuation, which demonstrates that the past\nadverse conduct, is unlikely to be repeated, and that the Applicant presently qualifies for\na security clearance.\n\n8\nAn individual who may be subject to foreign influence and has foreign\nconnections may be prone to provide information or make decisions that are harmful to\nthe interests of the United States.  The Government must be able to place a high\ndegree of confidence in a security clearance holder to abide by all security rules and\nregulations, at all times and in all places.\nCONCLUSIONS\nHaving considered the evidence of record in light of the appropriate legal\nstandards and factors, and having assessed the Applicant's credibility based on the\nrecord, this Administrative Judge concludes that the Government has established its\ncase as to all allegations in the SOR.   \nUnder Foreign Influence, Disqualifying Condition 7(a) contact with a foreign\nfamily member, business or professional associate, friend, or other person who is a\ncitizen of or resident of a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of\nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion and, 7(b)\nconnections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that create a potential\nconflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to protect sensitive information or\ntechnology and the individual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by\nproviding that information applies.  \n  \nHowever, the Applicant has provided compelling evidence to show that the\nfollowing Mitigating Conditions also apply to this particular case, given his particular\nbackground:  Mitigating Conditions 8(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign\npersons, the country in which these persons are located, or the positions or activities of\nthose persons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a\nposition of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, group,\norganization, or government and the interests of the U.S.; 8(b) there is no conflict of\ninterest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of loyalty or obligation to the foreign\nperson, group, government, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep\nand longstanding relationships and loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be\nexpected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S interest; 8(c) Contact or\ncommunication with foreign citizens is so casual and infrequent that there is little\nlikelihood that it could create a risk for foreign influence or exploitation and, 8(d) the\nforeign contacts and activities are on U.S. Government business or are approved by the\ncognizant security authority also apply.\nAlthough the Applicant has foreign family members who are residents and/or\ncitizens of Syria, the Applicant has limited contact with them.  Furthermore, there is no\nevidence of a close bond or strong evidence of affection.  The Applicant\u2019s deep and\nabiding ties are here in the United States.  All of his financial assets are in the United\nStates.  He is an American citizen.  For the past twenty years he has worked hard to\nestablish himself as a responsible, trustworthy, professional and loyal American citizen.\nHis unique employment with the DOD and his assets are all in the United States.  The\nApplicant has essentially cut all ties from Syria when he moved to the United States and\nmade it his permanent home for the past twenty years.  \n\n9\nHis relationship with his family in Syria, tenuous though it is, does create a\nheightened risk of foreign pressure or attempted exploitation because terrorists in the\nMiddle East seek intelligence and are hostile to the United States\u2019 interests.  Syria is not\na safe place for anyone, that much is true.  However, there is substantial evidence that\nthe Applicant behaved in a courageous and honorable way during his tour of duty in\nIraq.  His certificates from the Department of Defense reflect the Applicant\u2019s activities in\nIraq, his strong sense of integrity, and specifically his ability to safeguard classified\ninformation in a combat area.\nApplicant established application of Mitigating Conditions 8(a), 8(b), 8(c), and\n8(d).  Based on his relationships and depth of loyalty to the United States, he can be\nexpected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the United States interest.  He has\nlived in the United States since 1988, and has been a naturalized American citizen for\nfive years.  He appreciates the freedoms and opportunities given to him in the United\nStates which were not afforded to him in Syria.   He has limited contact with his family\nmembers living in Syria and there is no evidence that he has connections or contact\nwith anyone over there other than his family members.\nIt is noted that the current political situation in Syria elevates the cause for\nconcern in this case.  However, the evidence shows that the Applicant has no bond and\naffection with any foreign country or to any foreign individual or to any foreign\nGovernment in any way that could potentially cause the Applicant to become subject to\nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion against the\ninterests of the United States.  Therefore, there is no possibility of foreign influence that\ncould create the potential for conduct resulting in the compromise of classified\ninformation.  I find that the Applicant is not vulnerable to foreign influence.  Accordingly,\nI find for the Applicant under Guideline B (Foreign Influence).\nConsidering all the evidence, the Applicant has met the mitigating conditions of\nGuideline B of the adjudicative guidelines set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive.\nAccordingly, he has met his ultimate burden of persuasion under Guideline B.  \nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal Findings For or Against the Applicant on the allegations in the SOR, as\nrequired by Paragraph 25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive are:\nParagraph 1: For the Applicant.\nSubparas.\n1.a.: For the Applicant\nSubparas.\n1.b.: For the Applicant\nSubparas.\n1.c.: For the Applicant\n\n10\nDECISION\nIn light of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interests to grant or continue a security clearance for the\nApplicant.\nDarlene Lokey Anderson\nAdministrative Judge\n \n",

Applicant\nrequested the case be decided on the written record.  On December 4, 2008, after considering the\nrecord, Administrative Judge Joan Caton Anthony denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security\nclearance.  Applicant timely appealed pursuant to the Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nAppeal raises the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s decision is arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.  \nSpecifically, Applicant argues that the Judge should have found that his financial situation\nhas been mitigated by his good-faith attempts to settle his debts.  Applicant contends that the Judge\ndid not take into account all of the evidence he provided as to those attempts.  Applicant cites prior\nDOHA decisions which he believes are similar to his, in which a security clearance was granted.\nFinding no error, we affirm the Judge\u2019s unfavorable security clearance decision.\nApplicant had debts discharged in bankruptcy in December 2002.  Applicant\u2019s SOR lists\nseven other debts.  Three of those are state tax liens.  Applicant admits the existence of the liens, but\ndisputes the amounts in the SOR.  Applicant states that he paid off one debt of $500, but provided\nlimited documentation.   Applicant agrees to pay off a debt of $43 when he learns the identity of the\n1\ncreditor.  He states that he made a payment toward a debt of $1,809, but has not provided\ndocumentation.  Applicant denies a debt in the amount of $14,078, but admits that the debt  involves\na car for which he arranged a voluntary repossession.\nThere is a rebuttable presumption that the Judge considered all the record evidence unless\nthe Judge specifically states otherwise.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 07-18303 at 2 (App. Bd. Nov. 13,\n2008).  Applicant admitted several of the SOR allegations against him.  The burden then shifted to\nApplicant to extenuate or mitigate the security concerns raised by those allegations.  Directive\nE3.1.15.  The Judge concluded that Applicant did not present evidence sufficient to overcome the\nsecurity concerns raised.  The application of disqualifying and mitigating conditions and whole-\nperson factors does not turn simply on a finding that one or more of them apply to the particular facts\nof a case.  Thus, the presence of some mitigating evidence does not alone compel the Judge to make\na favorable security determination.  As the trier of fact, the Judge has to weigh the evidence as a\nwhole and decide whether the favorable evidence outweighs the unfavorable evidence, or vice versa.\nAn applicant\u2019s disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, or an ability to argue for a\ndifferent interpretation of the evidence, is not sufficient to demonstrate that the Judge weighed the\nevidence or reached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See,\ne.g., ISCR Case No. 06-23384 at 3 (App. Bd. Nov. 23, 2007).  \nApplicant\u2019s citation of other Hearing Office decisions he contends are similar to his case does\nnot demonstrate error on the part of the Judge.  While decisions by Hearing Office Judges in other\n\n3\ncases may be cited as persuasive authority, those cases are not binding legal precedent which a\nHearing Office Judge must follow in another situation.  Applicant\u2019s reliance on other Hearing Office\ndecisions does not demonstrate that the Judge erred in this case.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 04-04543\nat 3 (App. Bd. Sep. 14, 2005).  Moreover, the cases Applicant cites are distinguishable from his case,\nsince in those cases the Applicant had made significant progress in improving his/her financial\nsituation.  In this case, the Judge concluded that Applicant had not taken sufficient steps toward\nfinancial improvement, in spite of having the apparent means to do so.  Decision at 6.  The Judge\u2019s\ndecision is sustainable.\nOrder\nThe Judge\u2019s decision denying Applicant a security clearance is AFFIRMED.\nSigned: Jean E. Smallin          \nJean E.

His eligibility for a security clearance is denied. \n \nApplicant submitted and certified an Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations \nProcessing (e-QIP) on December 9, 2005.  On July 11, 2008, the Defense Office of \nHearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) \ndetailing the security concerns under Guideline F, Financial Considerations. The action \nwas taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, \nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the \nPresident on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for \nSORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nOn July 30, 2008 Applicant submitted a written notarized Answer to the SOR.  \nOn August 12, 2008, Applicant submitted a written notarized supplemental Answer to \nDecember 4, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \n \n                                           \nthe SOR.  In both documents, he requested that his case be determined on the record \nin lieu of a hearing. The Government compiled its File of Relevant Material (FORM) on \nSeptember 11, 2008. The FORM contained documents identified as Items 1 through 12.  \nBy letter dated September 17, 2008, a copy of the FORM was forwarded to Applicant, \nwith instructions to submit any additional information and/or objections within 30 days of \nreceipt.  Applicant received the file on September 23, 2008.  His response was due on \nOctober 23, 2008. He did not submit any additional information within the required time \nperiod.

From \nAugust 1976 to March 1995, he served on active duty with the U.S. military. He has held \na security clearance since at least 2001.

(SOR \u00b6 1.a; Item 2; Item 4; Item 7; Item 8.)   \n \n \nThe SOR alleged at \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.c, and 1.d that liens were filed against Applicant in \nMarch 2007, December 2006, and March 2004. The March 2007 lien was for $9,330; \nthe December 2006 lien was for $9,215, and the March 2004 lien was for $2,394. The \nthree liens were listed as unpaid on Applicant\u2019s credit reports of March 13, 2008 and \nJune 19, 2008.  The December 2006 lien of $9,215 and the March 2004 lien of $2,394 \nwere also listed under Applicant\u2019s name on a September 9, 2008 print-out of State A\u2019s \njudiciary judgments and liens. The print-out also listed a lien for $788.99, filed against \nApplicant in 2001, as satisfied.  (Item 10; Item 11; Item 12.) \n \n1 In his supplemental Answer, Applicant listed two responses to SOR \u00b6 1.e.  When his responses are \ncompared with the language of the SOR itself, they show that Applicant\u2019s second response to SOR \u00b6 1.e \naddresses the allegation in SOR \u00b6 1.f.   \n2 In his supplemental Answer, Applicant listed two responses to SOR \u00b6 1.g.  When his responses are \ncompared with the language of the SOR itself, they show that Applicant\u2019s second response to SOR \u00b6 1.g \naddresses the allegation in SOR \u00b6 1.h. \n\n \n3 \n \n \n \n \nIn his Answer of July 30, 2008, and in his supplemental Answer of August 12, \n2008, Applicant acknowledged that the liens were for back taxes, and he stated that he \nwas paying them off. He denied he owed the total amounts alleged in the SOR. He \nprovided a document, dated June 23, 2008, from State tax authority A, reporting that he \nowed $4,654.78 in unpaid taxes for tax years 2000, 2001, 2002, and 2005.  He also \nprovided a document, dated June 26, 2008, from a regional manager of a tax resolution \nfirm, reporting that she had contacted State A on Applicant\u2019s behalf and requested that \nApplicant pay the debt with monthly installments of $100. Applicant provided no other \ndocuments to rebut the amounts owed on the liens or to corroborate his assertion that \nhe was paying the liens identified in the SOR allegations. (Item 2; Item 4) \n \n \nApplicant admitted he owed $1,809 on a bad debt that had been placed for \ncollection and remained unpaid as of June 19, 2008. (SOR \u00b6 1.e) He further stated he \nhad sent the creditor a payment on the account.  He provided no documentation to \ncorroborate his statement that he had sent a payment to the creditor. (Item 1; Item 4; \nItem 9.) \n \n \nApplicant also admitted a charged-off medical debt of $43 that remained unpaid \nas of June 19, 2008. (SOR \u00b6 1.f.) He stated his intent to pay the debt in full after he had \nidentified the creditor.  (Item 1; Item 4.) \n \n \nApplicant denied a debt of approximately $500 and asserted he had paid it on \nMarch 19, 2008.  To corroborate his payment of the debt, he provided a photocopy of \nhis bank statement showing a payment of $500 made to a creditor on March 18, 2008.  \nApplicant\u2019s documentation was insufficient to show that he had paid the creditor \nidentified on the SOR.  However, his credit report of June 19, 2008, shows the debt \nidentified at SOR \u00b6 1.g as settled.  (Item 4; Item 11 at 2.) \n \n \nApplicant also denied a charged-off debt of approximately $14,078 that had not \nbeen paid as of March 15, 2008.  (SOR \u00b6 1.h.)  In his Answer to the SOR and in his \nsupplemental Answer to the SOR, he acknowledged he had financed a vehicle through \nthe creditor identified in the allegation at SOR \u00b6 1.h. He stated that the payments on the \nvehicle were causing him to fall into debt, and he therefore gave the vehicle up to the \ncreditor as a voluntary repossession.  (Item 1; Item 2; Item 4.) \n \n \nApplicant responded to financial interrogatories from DOHA on May 27, 2008. He \nprovided a sworn statement reporting that his annual gross income from salary and \nmilitary retirement pay was approximately $91,000.  His net monthly income from salary \nwas $5,210. He reported an additional $600 in net monthly income from military \nretirement pay. He listed $3,185 in fixed monthly expenses.  He reported that he was \nmaking monthly payments on two current financial obligations which totaled \napproximately $669. Additionally, he reported a monthly net remainder of $1,955. (Item \n6 at 7.) \n \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \n \n \nThe record does not indicate that Applicant has participated in consumer credit \ncounseling.   \n \nPolicies \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the  \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, the administrative judge applies these guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \nover-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of \nvariables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \n\n \n5 \n \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG & 18:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under \nAG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.  \nSimilarly under AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise \nsecurity concerns.  \n \nApplicant admitted a history of financial difficulties. In 1999, he declared Chapter \n13 bankruptcy, which was dismissed for non-payment in 2002.  Later in 2002, he moved \nto convert his Chapter 13 to a Chapter 7 bankruptcy.  In December 2002, his debts \nwere discharged in a Chapter 7 bankruptcy. Despite the fresh start afforded by his \nChapter 7 bankruptcy, Applicant acquired additional financial delinquencies, most \nnotably several tax liens and a deficiency resulting from a voluntary repossession of an \nautomobile. These obligations indicate he has substantial delinquent debt and is unable \nor unwilling to pay his creditors. This evidence is sufficient to raise the potentially \ndisqualifying conditions identified above, requiring a closer examination. \n \nGuideline F also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Several Guideline F mitigating conditions \ncould apply to the security concerns raised by Applicant\u2019s financial delinquencies. \nUnresolved financial delinquency might be mitigated if it happened so long ago, was so \ninfrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does \nnot cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. \n(AG \u00b6 20(a)) Additionally, unresolved financial delinquency might be mitigated if the \nconditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s \ncontrol, such as loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical \nemergency, or a death, divorce, or separation, and the individual acted responsibly \nunder the circumstances. (AG \u00b6 20(b)) Still other mitigating circumstances that might be \n\n \n6 \n \n \napplicable include evidence the person has received or is receiving counseling for the \nproblem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under \ncontrol (AG \u00b6 20(c)) or the individual has initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue \ncreditors or otherwise resolve debts. (AG \u00b6 20 (d))  \n \nApplicant stated that he was unable to follow through on his Chapter 13 \npayments in 1999 because his wife suffered a heart attack and was unable to work. \nWhile Applicant\u2019s wife\u2019s health problems were unfortunate and unpredictable, they \noccurred nine years ago. In his Answer and supplemental Answer to the SOR, Applicant \ndid not report further family health problems. However, his financial problems have \ncontinued, even though his annual gross income is over $90,000 a year and his monthly \nnet remainder is approximately $1,955. \n \n The record corroborates Applicant\u2019s statement that he satisfied the $500 medical \ndebt alleged at SOR \u00b61.g.   \n \nApplicant promised to pay the debt alleged at SOR \u00b6 1.f at some time in the \nfuture, when he had identified the creditor. He failed to provide documentation to \ncorroborate his assertion that he was paying the debt alleged at SOR \u00b6 1.e. He also \nfailed to rebut the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.c, and 1.d that he owed over $20,000 in \nliens that had not been satisfied as of June 19, 2008.  He failed to establish that he was \nnot responsible for a debt, alleged at SOR \u00b6 1.h, of approximately $14,078 which \nresulted from a voluntary repossession of an automobile he had purchased on credit.           \n \nThe record does not show that Applicant has participated in financial counseling. \nWhile he admitted some of his financial delinquencies, it was not clear that he \nunderstood his financial problems or how to resolve them. He appears to have sufficient \nfunds remaining at the end of each month to address his financial delinquencies. Even \nso, he had no plan in place to systematically resolve his substantial delinquent debt and \nprepare for future contingencies. I conclude that AG \u00b6 20(d) applies in part in mitigation, \nbut that AG \u00b6 20(a), AG \u00b6 20(b), and AG \u00b6 20(c) do not apply in mitigation to the facts of \nApplicant\u2019s case. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness \nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other \npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for \npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence.\u201d Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility \n\n \n7 \n \n \nfor a security clearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon \ncareful consideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant\u2019s financial problems have \noccurred in his mature adult years. (See AG & 2(a)(4).)  Since receiving a fresh financial \nstart after his Chapter 7 bankruptcy in 2002, Applicant has continued to accumulate \nunpaid debt. He has not taken affirmative action to pay or resolve the majority of his \ndelinquent debts, and this continues to raise security concerns. While he deserves \ncredit for payment his medical debt of $500, he has not demonstrated that he has used \nhis remaining monthly discretionary income to satisfy his many other remaining old \ndebts.  (See AG & 2(a)(6).)  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts at the present \ntime as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For these \nreasons, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns arising from his \nfinancial delinquencies.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST  APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.f: \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.g:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.h:             \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_________________ \nJoan Caton Anthony \nAdministrative Judge \n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is a 69-year-old employee of a federal contractor, where she has worked for almost two years as a customer service representative. In her answer, she admitted to all of the allegations in the SOR, with some explanations. Those admissions and explanations are incorporated in the following findings. Applicant was married to an Army warrant officer for more than 24 years. They divorced in 1990 or 1991. She has five children, the youngest two of whom were about ages 17 and 14 at that time and lived with her.

Howry, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Laura F. Gabel, Personal Representative\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nWHITE, David M., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant failed to pay state and Federal income taxes during many of the ten\nyears since her Chapter 7 bankruptcy discharge. She married a Russian immigrant she\nbarely knew in order to help him obtain legal residency, but has had no contact with him\nfor more than a year. She mitigated foreign influence concerns, but not financial\nconsiderations. Based upon a thorough review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and\ntestimony, eligibility for access to sensitive information is denied. \nApplicant submitted her Public Trust Position Application (SF 85P), on July 18,\n2007. On November 19, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under\nGuidelines F and B. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); Department of Defense (DoD)\nRegulation 5200.2-R, Personnel Security Program (January 1987), as amended\n(Regulation); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President\nMay 26, 2009\n\n2\non December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense (DoD) for SORs\nissued after September 1, 2006. \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on December 1, 2008. She\nanswered the SOR in writing on December 3, 2008, and requested a hearing before an\nadministrative judge. Department Counsel was ready to proceed on January 30, 2009,\nand DOHA assigned the case to me on that date.\nDOHA issued a notice of hearing on February 17, 2009, and I convened the\nhearing as scheduled on March 10, 2009. Department Counsel offered Government\nExhibits (GE) 1 through 8, which were admitted without objection. Applicant testified on\nher own behalf, and offered Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AE) A through E, which were also\nadmitted without objection. I granted Applicant\u2019s request to leave the record open until\nMarch 24, 2009, to permit submission of additional evidence. This evidence was\nforwarded by a letter dated March 20, 2009, that Department Counsel received and\nforwarded, without objection, on April 9, 2009. The evidence was marked AE F, and\nadmitted. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on March19, 2009.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 69-year-old employee of a federal contractor, where she has\nworked for almost two years as a customer service representative. In her answer, she\nadmitted to all of the allegations in the SOR, with some explanations. Those admissions\nand explanations are incorporated in the following findings. \nApplicant was married to an Army warrant officer for more than 24 years. They\ndivorced in 1990 or 1991. She has five children, the youngest two of whom were about\nages 17 and 14 at that time and lived with her. The then-17-year-old daughter has\ncontinued to live with Applicant ever since, and has two children of her own. This\ndaughter performs daycare in their home, but does not otherwise provide income to\nsupport their household. (GE 1 at 5-6; Tr. at 56-57, 60-61, 96-97.) In November 1998,\nApplicant could not afford to pay her debts and filed a petition for Chapter 7 bankruptcy.\nThis case resulted in discharge of her dischargeable debts in February 1999. (GE 2 at\n3; Tr. at 62, 65.)\nThe state in which she formerly resided, until 2000, filed tax liens against\nApplicant for $738 in August 2000, for $1,370 in September 2003, and for $2,425 in\nOctober 2003. (GE 2 at 3-4.) In September 2007, Applicant told an investigator from the\nOffice of Personnel Management (OPM) that she did not have money withheld to pay\nher state income taxes because she did not think she made enough money to owe any.\nShe did, however, show him a letter confirming that she had satisfied the $2,425 lien\nthat related to tax year 1999, and advised that she was paying her remaining state tax\ndebts at the rate of $100 per month. (GE 4 at 9.) She has continued those payments to\ndate, and her remaining state tax arrearage was $850.55 as of February 18, 2009. She\nintends to keep paying under this arrangement, which will conclude later this year at the\ncurrent rate. (AE E; Tr. at 45, 47-52.)    \n\n3\nThe Federal government filed a tax lien against Applicant in the amount of\n$17,771 in September 2004. (GE 2 at 3; GE 6.) This lien related to unpaid taxes for\nyears 1999, 2000, and 2001. (AE D.) Applicant provided a copy of her agreement with\nthe IRS  for installment payments of $602 per month to resolve her delinquent tax debt.\nThe agreement was negotiated in November 2008, and she began making payments in\nJanuary 2009. These documents reflect that her total delinquent Federal tax debt is\n$38,955, and includes arrearages from tax years 2002, 2003, 2004, and 2007, in\naddition to the three earlier years covered by the 2004 lien. It will take more than five\nyears to repay this debt if she makes all the payments as agreed. (AE C; AE D; AE F at\n5; Tr. at 52-55, 67-68.)\nApplicant told the OPM investigator in September 2007 that she thought the\n$17,771 Federal tax lien resulted from her not withholding income taxes during the\nyears 2000 through part of 2004 because she thought she was exempt from taxes\nbecause she did not make enough money. She said she had an offer in compromise\nprepared and intended to file it with the IRS when her finances were sufficiently in order\nto make the payment schedule. In her August 2008 response to DOHA interrogatories,\nshe said that the company that had prepared her offer in compromise was out of\nbusiness, and her accountant was preparing another one that she would file within the\nnext two weeks. (GE 4 at 9, 12.)\nDuring the hearing, Applicant explained that she adjusted her withholding for her\nformer state and Federal income taxes to zero because she needed the extra money to\nmeet living expenses. From 1999 to 2004 she did not file Federal returns, so she did not\ncalculate what she would have owed. She started filing tax returns again in 2005, but\ndid not explain why she owed delinquent taxes for 2007. She did submit a copy of the\nJuly 2008 bill from her accountant for preparing her 2007 Federal tax return, however,\nand testified that she did file a return for that year. (GE 4 at 14; Tr. at 56-58, 66-70, 88-\n90, 98.)\nApplicant married a Russian immigrant who she met at her church in April 2007\nafter a brief courtship. He needed to marry an American in order to obtain a green card\nand keep his job. Although they could barely communicate due to his poor English skills,\nhe was very nice to her and she married him because she \u201cthought this would be good.\u201d\nHe worked in a city about 20 miles from where she lives, and stayed there with friends\nduring the week after their marriage. He would stay at her house on weekends at first.\nShe sponsored his application for a green card, and he was able to keep his job. After\nabout a year of this, she asked him to contribute toward meeting household expenses\nand he refused. In April 2008, Applicant decided she had \u201chad enough\u201d and told him to\nmove out. She has not spoken to him since then.  She intends to divorce him someday,\nif and when she can afford the legal costs of doing so. She speaks no Russian, has\nnever met or spoken to any of his children who live in Germany and Russia, and has no\nongoing family relationship with him except being legally married. I took administrative\nnotice of the facts concerning Russia set forth in HE II, as requested by Department\nCounsel and without objection by Applicant. (Tr. at 30-35, 58-59, 70-75, 82-88, 99-102.)\n \n\n4\nApplicant provided a letter and testimony from her eldest daughter, and a letter\nfrom that daughter\u2019s husband, describing her loving and caring nature, honesty,\ndependability and trustworthiness. She is hardworking and always looking for ways she\ncan help others even to her own detriment. I evaluated Applicant\u2019s testimony to be\ncredible, although her memory for details was poor at times. Her present income is\nsufficient to meet her regular living expenses and comply with her tax repayment\nagreements, although with some difficulty. A recent Personal Financial Statement\nreflects a monthly surplus of $736. (AE A; AE B; AE F at 3-4, 6-7; Tr. at 96-111.)\nPolicies\nPositions designated as ADP I and ADP II are classified as \u201csensitive positions.\u201d\n(See Regulation \u00b6\u00b6 C3.1.2.1.1.7 and C3.1.2.1.2.3.)  \u201cThe standard that must be met for\n. . . assignment to sensitive duties is that, based on all available information, the\nperson\u2019s loyalty, reliability, and trustworthiness are such that . . . assigning the person to\nsensitive duties is clearly consistent with the interests of national security.\u201d (See\nRegulation \u00b6 C6.1.1.1.) The Deputy Under Secretary of Defense (Counterintelligence\nand Security) Memorandum, dated November 19, 2004, indicates trustworthiness\nadjudications will apply to cases forwarded to DOHA by the Defense Security Service\nand Office of Personnel Management. Department of Defense contractor personnel are\nafforded the right to the procedures contained in the Directive before any final\nunfavorable access determination may be made. (See Regulation \u00b6 C8.2.1.)  \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a public trust position, the\nadministrative judge must consider the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the AG.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of\nhuman behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the\nadjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair,\nimpartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a\nconscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d\nThe administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the\nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\n[sensitive] information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable\ntrustworthiness decision.\n\n5\nA person who applies for access to sensitive information seeks to enter into a\nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to sensitive information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard sensitive information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nsensitive information. \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that \u201cAny determination under this\norder adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest\nand shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d\nSee also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified\nor sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nAG \u00b6 18 expresses the security concern pertaining to financial considerations:\nFailure or inability to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially over-\nextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.\nCompulsive gambling is a concern as it may lead to financial crimes\nincluding espionage. Affluence that cannot be explained by known sources\nof income is also a security concern. It may indicate proceeds from\nfinancially profitable criminal acts.\nAG \u00b6 19 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be\ndisqualifying. Department Counsel argued persuasively that the evidence raised two of\nthese potentially disqualifying conditions: \u201c(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts;\u201d\nand \u201c(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d He cited her tax debts covering\nalmost ten years of delinquent taxes and substantial remaining amount due. (Tr. at\n113.) There was neither any allegation nor proof of compulsive, addictive, or problem\ngambling. Nor was there any evidence of drug abuse or alcoholism. However, there is\nsubstantial and undisputed evidence of many years of income tax evasion. Accordingly,\nthis evidence establishes the additional disqualifying condition: \u201c(d) deceptive or illegal\nfinancial practices such as embezzlement, employee theft, check fraud, income tax\nevasion, expense account fraud, filing deceptive loan statements, and other intentional\nfinancial breaches of trust.\u201d\n\n6\nAG \u00b6 20 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising from a\nhistory of unpaid debt. Since Applicant did not dispute the legitimacy of any SOR-listed\ndebt, the four potentially pertinent conditions are:\n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred\nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast\ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment;\n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely\nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business\ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or\nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;\n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is\nunder control; and\n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or\notherwise resolve debts.\nApplicant\u2019s delinquent taxes arose over the past ten years and she still owes\nmore than $39,000 despite recent repayment efforts. At least eight different tax years\nwere involved, including as recently as 2007. These debts were the result of her\ndeliberate choice to stop regular withholding so she could increase her available income\nto spend on other things. These actions by Applicant preclude any mitigation under AG\n\u00b6 20(a), since her deliberate choice to evade her state and Federal income tax\nobligations continues to reflect adversely on her judgment and trustworthiness. \nApplicant had her former debts discharged in bankruptcy in 1999, many years\nafter her divorce and when her youngest child was 22 years old. By definition, the debts\narose during periods when she was employed, since they involve income taxes that\nshould have been withheld from her wages. She did not act responsibly since she\ndeliberately chose not to pay these taxes. She accordingly established no mitigation\nunder AG \u00b6 20(b). She offered no evidence of financial counseling. She has entered\nrepayment programs for her delinquent taxes, but only began repaying her Federal\ntaxes a few months ago, and after receipt of the SOR, despite having told the OPM\ninvestigator she would do so months earlier. This conduct has begun to establish\nmitigation under AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(c) and (d), but has not continued for a sufficient period to\nindicate clearly that the problem is being resolved or to show a good-faith change in her\ndemonstrated disregard for her legal obligations toward the Government. Her lengthy\nperiod of failure to pay her taxes showed the lack of judgment and unwillingness to\nabide by rules and regulations at the heart of this guideline\u2019s security concerns.\n\n7\nGuideline B, Foreign Influence\nAG \u00b6 6 expresses the security concern regarding foreign influence:\nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual\nhas divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or\ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a\nway that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by\nany foreign interest. Adjudication under this Guideline can and should\nconsider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or\nfinancial interest is located, including, but not limited to, such\nconsiderations as whether the foreign country is known to target United\nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a\nrisk of terrorism.\nAG \u00b6 7 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be\ndisqualifying. The two conditions potentially raised by Applicant\u2019s marriage to a Russian\ncitizen are:\n(a) contact with a foreign family member, business or professional\nassociate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a\nforeign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign\nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and\n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that\ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation to\nprotect sensitive information or technology and the individual's desire to\nhelp a foreign person, group, or country by providing that information. \nApplicant married a man she barely knew primarily in order to help him become a\nresident alien who could legally continue to work in the U.S. She continued a\nrelationship with him on weekends for about a year, after which she broke off all\nconnections to him. She inquired into divorce, but found it would cost more than she\ncould afford so she has not yet pursued it. Her marriage is sufficient to raise prima facie\nsecurity concerns under these two disqualifying conditions, however.\nAG \u00b6 8 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. Those\napplicable to Applicant\u2019s brief marital relationship include:\n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in\nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those\npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be\nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign\nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the\nU.S.;\n\n8\n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual's sense of\nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country is\nso minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships\nand loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any\nconflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest; and\n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and\ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign\ninfluence or exploitation.\nDuring the period from April 2007 to April 2008, when Applicant and her husband\nhad some semblance of a family relationship, none of these conditions applied.\nHowever, since then she has had no contact with him whatsoever, and has no intention\nof pursuing any future relationship. She has never had any communication with any of\nhis children, and has no other contact with any Russians. Although Russia is among the\nmost active foreign nations targeting intelligence collection efforts against the U.S.,\nthere is nothing about her brief relationship with this Russian immigrant that would\npresently heighten the risk of her being targeted or exploited. She has no present loyalty\nor obligation toward him or any foreign entity. Accordingly, foreign influence security\nconcerns are mitigated.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a public trust position by considering the totality of the\napplicant\u2019s conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider\nthe nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a public\ntrust position must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.    \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant\u2019s conduct of concern\ninvolves her delinquent taxes dating back at least ten years, after a bankruptcy court\nhad discharged her debts and given her a fresh start to establish financial responsibility.\nHer tax debt exceeds $39,000 and will not be resolved for at least five years under a\n\n9\nplan she entered too recently to have yet established a pattern of compliance. She\ndeliberately chose not to pay taxes in order to have more funds available to spend on\nother things she wanted to buy for herself and others. Her entry into the Federal\nrepayment agreement covering the vast bulk of this debt was apparently motivated by\nher receipt of the SOR, rather than by any good-faith determination to fulfill her legal\nobligations to the Government. She is not subject to coercion or exploitation through her\nmarriage relationship to a Russian, but remains subject to pressure and duress due to\nher difficult financial position and the need to support her adult daughter and two\ngrandchildren. In the face of such pressures, she chose to violate her obligations to\nstate and Federal governments over a ten-year period, and a three-month period during\nwhich she repaid less than 5% of the resulting debt is insufficient to show that\nrecurrence is unlikely.\nOn balance, Applicant presented insufficient evidence to fully mitigate reliability\nand trustworthiness concerns arising from her failure to pay her taxes over the past ten\nyears. Overall, the record evidence leaves substantial doubts as to Applicant\u2019s present\neligibility and suitability for a public trust position. For all these reasons, Applicant has\nnot mitigated the security concerns arising from her financial considerations. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline B:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a\npublic trust position. Eligibility for access to ADP I/II/III sensitive information is denied.    \n \n \nDAVID M. WHITE\nAdministrative Judge\n",

On January 23, 2009, I forwarded copies of those documents for government review and comment by January 30, 2009. Pending receipt of the government\u2019s response, Applicant proposed a correction to the transcript to indicate that his mother-in-law stayed in Mainland China when her father went to Taiwan. That correction was accepted given Applicant\u2019s testimony that his mother-in-law had no contact with her father, who left for Taiwan when she was two or three years old. On February 11, 2009, Department Counsel confirmed he had received proposed Applicant exhibits E through H and that he had no objections. The documents were accepted into the record.

Foreign influence concerns persist because close family members\nremain resident citizens of the PRC. Clearance is denied.\nStatement of the Case\nApplicant submitted a Security Clearance Application (SF 86) in late May 2005.1\nOn September 19, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued to\nApplicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under\nGuideline B that provided the basis for its action to deny him a security clearance and to\nrefer the matter to an administrative judge. The action was taken under Executive Order\nApril 20, 2009\n\nCountry Reports on Human Rights Practices-2007, China (includes Tibet, Hong Kong, and Macau),\n2\ndated March 11, 2008 (Admin.

He\nanswered the SOR in writing on October 11, 2008, and requested a hearing before an\nadministrative judge. The case was assigned to me on November 17, 2008. On\nDecember 8, 2008, I scheduled a hearing for January 8, 2009.\nI convened the hearing as scheduled. Two government exhibits (Ex. 1-2) and\nfour Applicant exhibits (A-D) were admitted and Applicant testified on his behalf, as\nreflected in a transcript (Tr.) received on January 28, 2009. Based upon a review of the\ncase file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified\ninformation is denied at this time.\nProcedural and Evidentiary Rulings\nAt the hearing, Department Counsel submitted a request for administrative notice\ndated January 5, 2009, asking that notice be taken of certain facts relating to the\nPeople\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) and its foreign relations, including with the U.S. The\nrequest was based on publications from the Department of State,  the Interagency\n2\nOPSEC Support Staff,  the U.S. China Economic and Security Review Commission,\n3\n4\nand the Office of the National Counterintelligence Executive,  as well as on press\n5\nreleases from the U.S. Department of Justice.  The government\u2019s formal request and\n6\n\n3\nthe attached documents were marked as administrative notice documents 1-12 at the\nhearing.\nSince Applicant was not provided those documents for administrative notice until\nthe hearing, I held the record open until January 23, 2009, for Applicant to file any\nobjections to the specific facts proposed for administrative notice by the government\nand/or the source documents relied on by the government.\nOn January 22, 2009, Applicant indicated he had no objection to the\ngovernment\u2019s request for administrative notice. Accordingly, administrative notice was\ntaken of particular facts pertaining to the PRC, as set forth in the Findings of Fact.\nApplicant also submitted four additional documents for inclusion in the record (Exhibits\nE-H). On January 23, 2009, I forwarded copies of those documents for government\nreview and comment by January 30, 2009.\nPending receipt of the government\u2019s response, Applicant proposed a correction\nto the transcript to indicate that his mother-in-law stayed in Mainland China when her\nfather went to Taiwan. That correction was accepted given Applicant\u2019s testimony that\nhis mother-in-law had no contact with her father, who left for Taiwan when she was two\nor three years old.\nOn February 11, 2009, Department Counsel confirmed he had received\nproposed Applicant exhibits E through H and that he had no objections. The documents\nwere accepted into the record.\nFindings of Fact\nDOHA alleged under Guideline B, foreign influence, that Applicant\u2019s parents and\nbrother are resident citizens of the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) (SOR \u00b6 1.a) and\nhe contacts them by telephone about once a week (SOR \u00b6 1.b). Also, Applicant\u2019s\nparents-in-law are PRC citizens who have resided with him each summer since 2003\nbut have spent the cold weather months in the PRC (SOR \u00b6 1.c), and that he has\ntelephone contact with them when they are in the PRC about once a week (SOR \u00b6 1.d).\nFurthermore, Applicant was alleged to have traveled to the PRC on various occasions,\nin at least November 2003, January 2004, June 2004, February 2005, and October\n2005 (SOR \u00b6 1.e), and to have visited relatives and some childhood friends and\nschoolmates when in the PRC (SOR \u00b6 1.f). In addition, Applicant helped secure work in\nthe U.S. for an architectural drafting company in the PRC owned by a relative (SOR \u00b6\n1.g). Finally, DOHA alleged that Applicant believed his parents had listed a home in the\nPRC under his name (SOR \u00b6 1.h). Applicant admitted the allegations without\nexplanation. After considering the evidence of record, I make the following findings of\nfact.\nApplicant is a 40-year-old computer software engineer who has been employed\nby a U.S. consulting company since May 2005 (Ex. 1). He requires a security clearance\n\nApplicant\u2019s brother was born in February 1966 (Ex. 2) and not in February 1969 as reported on the\n7\nSF 86 (Ex. 1).\nThe letter from the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service granting political asylum (Ex. H) is\n8\naddressed only to Applicant, but Applicant testified that his spouse \u201ckind of attached to [his] application.\u201d (Tr.\n71).\n4\nfor duties at a university-affiliated research and development laboratory engaged in\ndefense-related work (Tr. 45). He has an interim clearance (Tr. 86).\nApplicant was born and raised in a southern province of the PRC with his only\nsibling, an older brother.  Their mother worked as a physician and their father as an\n7\narchitect before they retired (Ex. 2, Tr. 58-59).\nApplicant and his future spouse, who is from the same hometown, were active in\npro-democracy activities in the PRC while Applicant was a university student studying\nmechanics (Tr. 88). Together, after he learned that local authorities had him under\nsurveillance, they fled the PRC for Hong Kong in July 1989 after the Tiananmen Square\ncrackdown. In 1990, they came to the U.S. with a student visa (Tr. 68-69, 71-72, 88).\nThere were consequences to the family members they left behind in the PRC. His\nmother lost her position as a hospital administrator and had to resume staff medical\nduties, and she was also ejected as a member of the Chinese Communist Party (Tr. 69-\n70). Her mother was questioned by Chinese authorities on a daily basis for more than a\nmonth about her daughter\u2019s activities (Tr. 72).\nIn December 1992, Applicant and his spouse married in the U.S., and in January\n1995, both were granted political asylum in the U.S.  One year later, they were eligible\n8\nto apply for lawful permanent residence in the U.S. (Ex. H). After completing his\nbachelor\u2019s degree in electrical engineering, Applicant continued his academic studies at\nthe same university for his master\u2019s degree in computer science (Ex. 89).\nIn May 1996, Applicant was awarded his master of science degree from a public\nuniversity in the U.S. (Ex. 1). In 1998, Applicant\u2019s father visited him in the U.S., staying\nabout two months (Ex. 2).\nApplicant was a research assistant in the university\u2019s computer science\ndepartment before he entered the private sector to work as a computer programmer in\nApril 2000 (Tr. 91), following the birth of his and his spouse\u2019s first daughter in March\n2000. Their second daughter was born in April 2001. His parents visited them in the\nU.S. in 2001, staying two months (Ex. 2).\nIn July 2001, Applicant and his spouse became naturalized U.S. citizens, and the\nfollowing month, he obtained his U.S. passport. (Ex. 1). It is unclear when his spouse\nobtained her U.S. passport.\nApplicant became unemployed in late July 2003. In October 2003, he began to\nassist a PRC drafting and architectural design company owned by his brother\u2019s father-\n\nApplicant\u2019s primary purpose was to visit his family in the PRC and he thought if he listed it as\n9\nbusiness travel, some of it might be deductible as a business expense. On occasion, he discussed business\nwith his sister-in-law (Tr. 90).\n5\nin-law. He secured drafting work for the PRC firm in the U.S. involving house drawings\nand floor plans (Ex. A, Tr. 45, 47) and he dealt with the projects in the U.S. on the\nforeign firm\u2019s behalf. Applicant was not paid for his services other than being treated to\na meal when he went to the PRC (Ex. 2, Tr. 75-76). Applicant traveled to the PRC\nprimarily to see his parents in November 2003, January 2004, June 2004, and February\n2005 (Ex. 1), but he also discussed business with his sister-in-law on occasion (Tr. 90).\nOn one or more of those trips, he also visited with some childhood friends (Ex. 2, Tr.\n54).\nIn March 2004, Applicant was rehired by the U.S. company that had employed\nhim from April 2000 to July 2002 (Ex. 1). He continued his unpaid activities for the PRC\nfirm while working for the U.S. company, and even after commencing his present\nemployment and being placed at the university-affiliated laboratory in May 2005 (Ex. 1,\nTr. 76). In late May 2005, Applicant executed a SF 86. He disclosed the PRC citizenship\nand residency of his parents and brother. He provided his address for his parents-in-\nlaw, who are PRC citizens but since 2003 have had U.S. green cards (Ex. 2). In\nresponse to question 12, \u201cDo you have any foreign property, business connections, or\nfinancial interests?,\u201d he indicated that he had provided drafting services with U.S.\narchitects and factories for the PRC design firm from October 1, 2003, to present. He\nlisted business travel to the PRC in November 2003, January 2004, June 2004, and\nFebruary 2005, under question 16 concerning foreign travel in the last 7 years.  (Ex. 1).\n9\nOn February 23, 2006, Applicant was interviewed by a government investigator\nabout his foreign relatives. He indicated that his parents and brother were still resident\ncitizens of the PRC, where his mother was a retired gynecologist, his father a retired\narchitect, and his brother a practicing physician. In addition to visiting with them during\nhis trips to the PRC, including a recent trip taken with his family in October 2005,\nApplicant related he had ongoing telephone contact with them on a weekly basis. As for\nhis parents-in-law, Applicant explained that since they had obtained their U.S. lawful\npermanent residence status in 2003, they have stayed with him and his spouse in the\nU.S. each summer while spending the colder months in the PRC. When they are in the\nPRC, Applicant has weekly telephone contact with them. Applicant explained his foreign\nbusiness interests consisted of uncompensated assistance for a PRC design firm\nowned by his brother\u2019s father-in-law. Applicant expressed his belief, although he was\nnot certain, that his parents may have put a house in his name in the PRC. Applicant\ndenied it was important to his overall financial situation. Applicant denied any other\ncontacts with foreign nationals apart from in-person visits with his childhood and school\nfriends when he went to the PRC. (Ex. 2)\nApplicant last traveled to the PRC to see his family in summer 2007. He does not\nfeel he is at risk when he is in the PRC because of the protections afforded him as a\nU.S. citizen with a U.S. passport (Tr. 70). Before he acquired his U.S. citizenship, he\n\n6\n\u201cdidn\u2019t even dare go across to there\u201d but he believes the PRC does not view the student\ndemonstrations as severely as in the past (Tr. 71). Applicant does not intend to engage\nin any business activities involving a PRC national or firm as long as he holds a security\nclearance now that he is aware of the potential security issues (Tr. 94).\nApplicant intends to continue to have weekly contact with his parents in the PRC,\nand to visit them on occasion, as it is the right thing to do (Tr. 53). His parents do not\nspeak English and do not want to live in the U.S. (Tr. 52). They reside in an apartment\nthat they own in the PRC (Tr. 59). The property on which the apartment is situated is\nleased from the PRC government for 70 years (Tr. 60). Applicant\u2019s parents live on their\nretirement funds (pensions) and income from several rental properties (Tr. 60-61, 78).\nThey mentioned to Applicant in the past that they might list one of their rental properties\n(an apartment) worth about $50,000 to $80,000 USD in Applicant\u2019s name (Tr. 78).\nApplicant sends his parents financial gifts totaling between $5,000 and $10,000 a year\n(Tr. 79). He has told his parents where he works but they are not aware that he holds an\ninterim security clearance. He has mentioned to them that the work he does requires a\ngovernment clearance (Tr. 86-87).\nApplicant\u2019s brother is a practicing physician on staff of a quasi-public hospital in\nthe PRC. He is married to an engineer, who is currently not working outside of the\nhome. They have a seven-year-old son. Applicant\u2019s brother\u2019s family lives with his\nparents and they cover some of the household expenses (Tr. 61-63). Applicant speaks\nwith his brother if he is around during telephone calls with his parents (Tr. 78).\nApplicant\u2019s parents-in-law own their home in the PRC in which they reside when\nthey are not with Applicant and his spouse in the U.S. They have their own business\ninvolving metal-plating for electronic/electrical components (Tr. 64). Applicant and his\nspouse do not send them money (Tr. 78). Applicant\u2019s spouse has a younger brother\nwho did not finish high school. He is divorced with two children. He lives with his parents\nand works in the family business (Tr. 65).\nApplicant does not have any ongoing contact with his childhood friends from his\nhometown, although he has had dinner with them during trips to the PRC (Tr. 86).\nAs of January 2009, Applicant had not assisted the PRC architectural design\ncompany in more than one year (Tr. 76). As of October 1, 2008, the company had\ndiscontinued all design activities. As of December 1, 2008, it was no longer registered\nas a viable business in the PRC (Ex. B). Applicant does not intend to engage in similar\nconduct in the future as long as he works for the government (\u201cbasically I believe I\nshould be more conscious about these situations when I need to earn the trust of the\ngovernment because before I applied for this security clearance and I didn\u2019t know any of\nthese requirements.\u201d Tr. 93).\nApplicant and his spouse had another daughter in 2006 (Ex. C, Tr. 79).\nApplicant\u2019s spouse is a software programmer by profession. She does not currently\nwork outside of the home (Tr. 76, 79). She accompanied Applicant to the PRC on the\n\n7\ntrips in October 2005 and in summer 2007 (Tr. 77). They own their home in the U.S.,\nwhich they bought in 2004. Its current assessed value is about $600,000, and the\nprincipal owed on the mortgage is \u201c$300,000 something.\u201d (Tr. 83). Including the equity\nin his home and retirement accounts, Applicant estimated his family\u2019s net worth in the\nU.S. to be between $500,000 and $800,000 (Tr. 84). Applicant has no intention to return\nto the PRC to live. He has no present travel plans that include the PRC (Tr. 85).\nApplicant\u2019s spouse is a formal member of a church for about the past ten years.\nAlthough not a formal member, Applicant attends Bible study and worship services\nthere on a regular basis for over the past five years (Ex. G, Tr. 82-83). Applicant is also\na dedicated member of two Toastmasters\u2019 clubs (Ex. F). He is a founding member of\nthe club\u2019s chapter at the laboratory and has served as a chapter officer in various\ncapacities (treasurer, vice president for membership, vice president for education) since\nits inception in 2006 (Exs. E, F, Tr. 80).\nThe software team leader who has directly supervised Applicant\u2019s work at the\nlaboratory for the past year attests to the valuable expertise Applicant possesses in a\ncertain operating system and in network communications systems. He has made\nsignificant contributions to a number of projects during his time at the laboratory, and\nhas never given the team leader reason to doubt Applicant\u2019s allegiance to the U.S. (Ex.\nE). \nFollowing review of official publications of the U.S. government that address the\neconomic, political, and intelligence activities of the PRC, I take administrative notice of\nthe following facts:\nThe PRC is a large and economically powerful country, with a population of over\n1.3 billion people. Its economy grew at 11.4% in 2007. China has an authoritarian\ngovernment dominated by the Chinese Communist Party. The National People\u2019s\nCongress, the PRC\u2019s legislative body, is the highest organ of state power. With China\nfirmly committed to economic reform and greater openness, the influence of people and\norganizations outside the formal party structure has increased, but in all important\ngovernment, economic, and cultural institutions in China, the Chinese Communist Party\nensures that party and state policy guidance is followed. During 2007, the PRC\ngovernment\u2019s human rights record remained poor, with a trend toward increased\nharassment, detention, and imprisonment by government and security authorities of\nthose perceived as threatening to government authority. Authorities monitored\ntelephone conversations, facsimile transmissions, e-mail, text messaging, and Internet\ncommunications. The security services in China routinely monitored and entered\nresidences and offices to gain access to computers, telephones, and fax machines.\nForeign government officials, journalists, and business people with access to advanced\nproprietary technology are particularly likely to be under surveillance. Foreign visitors in\nthe PRC may be placed under surveillance by security personnel, their hotel rooms,\ntelephones, and facsimile machines monitored, and their personal possessions,\nincluding computers, searched without their knowledge or consent. Americans not\n\n8\nstaying in hotels in China, including those staying with friends or relatives, must register\nwith local police as soon as they arrive.\nSince the Tiananmen Square crackdown in June 1989, the PRC has become a\nkey participant in the international community through its seat as a permanent member\nof the Security Council of the United Nations, and through diplomatic relations with other\ncountries. The U.S. and PRC have a history of cooperation on scientific and\nenvironmental issues. Recently, the two countries have cooperated with growing\neffectiveness on counterterrorism and on various aspects of law enforcement (computer\ncrime, intellectual property rights, human smuggling, corruption). China, a member of\nthe World Trade Organization since December 2001, is an important trading partner of\nthe U.S. Its trade surplus with the U.S. was $256.3 billion in 2007 while U.S. goods\nexports to China accounted for 5.7% of total U.S. goods exports. The U.S. is the sixth-\nlargest foreign investor in the PRC.\nThe PRC possesses large military forces (strategic nuclear forces, army, navy\nand air force), which are in the process of transformation into a smaller, more mobile,\nhigh-tech military. In the last decade, the PRC\u2019s strategic posture has been one of\nselective modernization with an increasing focus on space-based assets. Civil-military\nintegration has led to increased utilization of commercial systems in military\napplications. The PRC places enormous pressure on foreign companies, including U.S.\nfirms, to transfer technology to Chinese companies as part of doing business in China.\nIn furtherance of these efforts, the PRC has aggressively targeted sensitive and\nprotected U.S. economic and militarily critical information subject to export control laws.\nThe PRC blends intelligence and non-intelligence assets, relying on covert espionage\nactivity by personnel from government ministries, commissions, institutes, and military\nindustries independent of the PRC intelligence services, and by targeting ethnic\nChinese who have access to sensitive information. Americans of Chinese ancestry are\nconsidered prime intelligence targets.\nA record number of countries (108) were involved in collection efforts against\nsensitive and protected U.S. technologies in fiscal year 2005 with a small number,\nincluding the PRC, among the most aggressive. As of 2007, as Chinese espionage\nagainst the U.S. military and American business continued to outpace the overwhelmed\nU.S. counterintelligence community, critical American secrets and proprietary\ntechnologies were being transferred to China. Ethnic Chinese with U.S. citizenship\nand/or legal residency have been convicted of procuring and exporting or attempting to\nexport sensitive U.S. technology to the PRC in violation of export controls. U.S.\nImmigration and Customs Enforcement officials have rated China\u2019s espionage and\nindustrial theft activities as the leading threat to the security of U.S. technology. The\nFederal Bureau of Investigation stepped up counterintelligence efforts against Chinese\nintelligence operations in the U.S. in July 2007 because of substantial concern about\nthose operations. In May 2008, a U.S. naturalized citizen, who operated as an\nunregistered agent of the PRC government in the U.S., pleaded guilty to conspiracy to\ndeliver national defense information to the PRC. A PRC citizen with U.S. permanent\nresidency was convicted of aiding and abetting this unregistered agent between March\n\nThere is no allegation that Applicant has engaged in any economic espionage or attempted to violate\n10\nexport controls for the benefit of the PRC. The criminal activity of others is relevant to the extent it reflects\nongoing efforts by the PRC to target U.S. sensitive technologies.\n9\n2007 and February 2008. In June 2008, a software engineer was sentenced under the\nEconomic Espionage Act (18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1831) for misappropriating a trade secret from\nhis former employer with the intent to benefit the PRC.10\nPolicies\nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the\nExecutive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security\nemphasizing, \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v.\nEgan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security\nclearance, the administrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines\n(AG). In addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative\nguidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are\nuseful in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship\ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government\nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to\n\n10\nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk\nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified\ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation\nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis\nGuideline B, Foreign Influence\nThe security concern about foreign influence is set out in AG & 6:\nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual\nhas divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or\ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a\nway that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by\nany foreign interest. Adjudication under this Guideline can and should\nconsider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or\nfinancial interest is located, including, but not limited to, such\nconsiderations as whether the foreign country is known to target United\nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a\nrisk of terrorism.\nApplicant and his spouse entered the U.S. from Hong Kong in 1990 after fleeing\nthe PRC because of their involvement in pro-democracy student demonstrations. They\nwere granted political refugee status in 1991, and became naturalized U.S. citizens in\nJuly 2001. They left behind their parents and only siblings in the PRC. Applicant\nremains close to his parents, with whom he has telephone contact once weekly. He\nsends them between $5,000 and $10,000 per year. His father visited him in the U.S. in\n1998 and both parents visited in 2001. Applicant has traveled to the PRC five times\nsince November 2003 to see them, most recently in summer 2007. Applicant also has\nbonds of affection and/or obligation for his brother and brother\u2019s family members in the\nPRC. Applicant converses with his brother on occasion by telephone. Between October\n2003 and 2007, Applicant aided the business interests of his brother\u2019s father-in-law by\nhelping secure some architectural draft and design work in the U.S. for his firm in the\nPRC. AG \u00b6 7(a) (\u201ccontact with a foreign family member, business or professional\nassociate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a foreign country if\nthat contact creates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation,\npressure, or coercion\u201d) applies.\nThe PRC is known to aggressively target U.S. sensitive technology. Although\nApplicant feels safe traveling in the PRC because of the protections afforded him as a\n\n11\nU.S. citizen, the risk of foreign influence is heightened in light of his past student\nactivism. Local government surveillance of his activities led him and his spouse to flee\ntheir homeland, with adverse consequences for their family members in the PRC. His\nmother was demoted from her position as a physician administrator and expelled from\nthe Chinese Communist Party. His mother-in-law was questioned repeatedly about his\nspouse\u2019s activities, although there is no evidence of any recent inquiries. AG \u00b6 7(b),\n\u201cconnections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that create a potential\nconflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to protect sensitive information or\ntechnology and the individual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by\nproviding that information,\u201d is also implicated.\nThe bonds that Applicant shares with his parents-in-law, personally as well as\nthrough his spouse, also must be taken into account in assessing the risk of undue\nforeign influence (see AG \u00b6 7(d), \u201csharing living quarters with a person or persons,\nregardless of citizenship status, if that relationship creates a heightened risk of foreign\ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion\u201d). His parents-in-law have enjoyed\nU.S. lawful permanent residence status since about 2003. They have spent the warmer\nmonths in the U.S. since then, staying with Applicant and his spouse in their home.\nWhen his parents-in-law are living in the PRC, Applicant and/or his spouse have weekly\ntelephone contact with them. AG \u00b6 7(d) applies as well. Little is known about the nature\nof the personal relationship Applicant or his spouse has with her brother. The risk of\nundue foreign influence as to her brother is established primarily through her parents,\nwho provide shelter and employment for her brother in the PRC. Conceivably, the PRC\nauthorities could exploit the bonds his in-laws share with their son, and in turn Applicant\nand his spouse with his in-laws, in an attempt to gain improper influence.\nApplicant does not have any current plans to travel to the PRC. No evidence was\npresented as to the extent of his or his spouse\u2019s family members\u2019 travel plans. Future\ntravel to the PRC cannot be ruled out by Applicant or his spouse as long as their family\nmembers are resident citizens of the PRC. There is no indication that his parents-in-law\nplan to discontinue what has been their pattern of spending the warmer months in the\nU.S. and the cooler months in the PRC. The risk of Applicant and his spouse\u2019s\nvulnerability is heightened in the event of any such travel to the PRC, as they would be\nwithin the reach of Chinese entities, including the PRC government, that might seek to\nexert influence to gain access to classified information. At the same time, there is no\nevidence showing that Applicant, his spouse, or their family members have engaged in\nany conduct or been targeted while in the PRC (SOR \u00b6 1.f) that would implicate AG \u00b6\n7(i), \u201cconduct, especially while traveling outside the U.S., which may make the individual\nvulnerable to exploitation, pressure, or coercion by a foreign group, government, or\ncountry.\u201d\nApplicant\u2019s relationships with his childhood friends and schoolmates  (SOR \u00b6 1.f)\nappear to be sufficiently casual to raise little concern (see AG 8(c), \u201ccontact or\ncommunication with foreign citizens is so causal and infrequent that there is little\nlikelihood that it could create a risk for foreign influence or exploitation\u201d). Applicant does\nnot deny that during his trips to the PRC, his friends from his hometown would call and\n\n12\nthey would share a meal together, but he has no ongoing, regular contact with them (Tr.\n85-86).\nThe evidence falls short of establishing a substantial foreign interest that would\nimplicate AG \u00b6 7(e), \u201ca substantial business, financial, or property interest in a foreign\ncountry, or in any foreign-owned or foreign-operated business, which could subject the\nindividual to a heightened risk of foreign influence or exploitation.\u201d Since Applicant did\nnot receive monetary compensation for his efforts in securing design work for the PRC\nfirm, the security concerns that arise from his past foreign business activities, which\nceased more than a year ago,  are more appropriately covered under AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a) and\n7(b). The government\u2019s case for ownership of a substantial foreign property interest\nrests on an assumption by Applicant that his parents might have put an apartment in his\nname in the PRC (SOR \u00b6 1.h). During his February 2006 interview, Applicant told a\ngovernment investigator that he believed his parents might have put a house under his\nname, but also that he was not positive and did not know where the house was located.\nHe also denied it was important to his overall financial situation. At his hearing,\nApplicant testified about his parents\u2019 rental properties as follows:\nBecause they mentioned to me before, because they have several rental\nproperties, they might put one under my name because that\u2019s what they\ndo when they are parents, but I, I don\u2019t know which one, but they just\nmight put some property under my name, but what can I do? (Tr. 78)\nIn response to \u201chow much this property might be worth,\u201d Applicant stated, \u201cI\u2019d say about\n$50,000 to $80,000.\u201d (Tr. 78). Even at the hearing, Applicant could not confirm that he\nheld a foreign financial asset in his name. Based on the evidence before me, I conclude\nAG \u00b6 7(e) does not apply.\nApplicant admitted that he dared not travel to the PRC before he obtained his\nU.S. passport. Yet, it must also be acknowledged that he fled to Hong Kong and then\nthe U.S. almost 20 years ago. Per his account, he faced no improper questioning at the\nborder on the trips to the PRC since November 2003. What he heard from his parents\nled him to believe that the PRC government does not view the student demonstrations\nas seriously as it once did. Applicant\u2019s unrebutted testimony is that his and his spouse\u2019s\nfamily members are connected to the PRC government only to the extent that his\nparents receive retirement pensions from their previous employments (his mother from\na hospital that was government-owned in the past) and his brother is a practicing\nphysician at a hospital that has been privatized to some extent. Yet, I am unable to\napply mitigating condition AG \u00b6 8(a), \u201cthe nature of the relationships with foreign\npersons, the country in which these persons are located, or the positions or activities of\nthose persons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a\nposition of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, group,\norganization, or government and the interests of the U.S.,\u201d because of the close familial\nbonds both he and his spouse have in the PRC and the PRC\u2019s aggressive pursuit of\n\nThe Appeal Board has articulated a \u201cheightened risk\u201d or \u201cvery heavy burden\u201d in People\u2019s Republic\n11\nof China (PRC) cases because of that country\u2019s hostility to the U.S. and aggressive intelligence collection\nefforts. See ISCR Case No. 06-24575 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 7, 2007) (articulating \u201cvery heavy burden\u201d standard\nand reversing grant of clearance in case involving family members living in the PRC); ISCR Case No. 07-\n02485 at 4-5 (App. Bd. May 9, 2008); ISCR Case No. 07-02485 at 4-5 (App. Bd. May 9, 2008).\n13\nU.S. sensitive and classified information.  As recently as 2007, the PRC security\n11\nservices were known to monitor the communications and activities of some of its\ncitizens and even of foreign visitors. There is no indication the PRC has ceased its\nsurveillance activities. Applicant\u2019s and his spouse\u2019s past student activism brought\nunwanted governmental notice to both families in the past. Moreover, while Applicant\nhas not discussed his work with his family, he has told his parents that he works for a\nuniversity-affiliated laboratory.\nThe risk of foreign influence may yet be mitigated by deep and longstanding\nrelationships and loyalties in the U.S. (see AG \u00b6 8(b), \u201cthere is no conflict of interest,\neither because the individual's sense of loyalty or obligation to the foreign person,\ngroup, government, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and\nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected\nto resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest\u201d). Applicant\u2019s involvement\nin pro-democracy student demonstrations makes him very unlikely to engage in actions\nintended to benefit the PRC government, the Chinese Communist Party, or any agents\nor instrumentalities acting on the PRC\u2019s behalf. He is not seen as susceptible to any\nsolicitations based on ethnic heritage. He has demonstrated his commitment to the\nU.S., having acquired U.S. citizenship and made his life and career in the U.S. Applicant\nhas given his supervisor at work no reason to doubt his truthfulness or his reason to\ndoubt his allegiance to the U.S. By all accounts, he is a dedicated employee and a good\nfather to his children, who are U.S. citizens from birth. He is an active member of two\nToastmasters clubs. Although not a formal member of his spouse\u2019s church, he attends\nservices weekly and Bible study as well.\nThe concern is not that Applicant would knowingly jeopardize U.S. interests.\nRather, it is that he may be placed in a situation of potential conflict between the\ninterests of his close family in the PRC and the interests of the U.S., and that he might\nnot recognize the security risk presented by helping out a close family member in the\nPRC. Applicant continued to provide assistance to his brother\u2019s father-in-law\u2019s company\nin the PRC while working for his current employer and performing defense-related\nduties at a university-affiliated laboratory. The PRC firm for which he had provided\nunpaid assistance is no longer in operation, but it was not until recently that Applicant\nhad any understanding that his duties for the company could create a security risk.\nDespite the circumstances under which he left the PRC in 1989, Applicant did not seem\nto be concerned about his travel to the PRC since November 2003 because he held a\nU.S. passport. He believes the PRC has changed its attitude toward the student\ndemonstrations of the past, but the State Department reports ongoing human rights\nabuses. The foreign influence concerns are not fully mitigated.\n\n14\n Whole-Person Concept\nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.\nThe salient issue in the security clearance determination is not in terms of loyalty,\nbut rather what is clearly consistent with the national interest. See Executive Order\n10865, Section 7. I have considered all the factors as previously discussed under the\nforeign influence guideline, supra, as part of the whole-person analysis. An applicant\nmay have the best of intentions and yet be in an untenable position of potentially having\nto choose between a dear family member and the interests of the U.S. A Guideline B\ndecision involving the PRC must take into consideration the geopolitical situation. With\nChina firmly committed to economic reform and greater openness, the influence of\npeople and organizations outside the formal party structure has increased, but in all\nimportant government, economic, and cultural institutions in China, the Chinese\nCommunist Party ensures that party and state policy guidance is followed. During 2007,\nthe PRC government\u2019s human rights record remained poor, and the PRC is a known\ncollector of U.S. intelligence and economic information. Applicant\u2019s parents intend to\nremain in the PRC, so while Applicant has no current plans to travel there, future travel\ncannot be completely ruled out. He sends them between $5,000 and $10,000 per year\nin monetary gifts. He provided assistance to a PRC drafting and design firm owned by a\nmember of his brother\u2019s family from October 2003 to sometime in 2007. While his duties\ndid not involve sensitive or classified matters, it shows a desire and willingness to help\nfamily members in the PRC. It is precisely the close familial bonds in the PRC, which\nare not a factor within his control, that present an unmitigated security risk. Under the\ntotality of the facts and circumstances, I am unable to conclude that it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant Applicant a security clearance at this time.\n\n15\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline B:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst  Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst  Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to\nclassified information is denied.\nELIZABETH M. MATCHINSKI\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Hayes, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nFOREMAN, LeRoy F., Administrative Judge: \n \nThis case involves security concerns raised under Guidelines F (Financial \nConsiderations) and E (Personal Conduct). Eligibility for access to classified information \nis denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application on April 13, 2007. On \nDecember 22, 2010, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) sent him a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its preliminary decision to deny his \napplication, citing security concerns under Guidelines F and E. DOHA acted under \nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February \n20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \n(Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) implemented by the Department of \nDefense on September 1, 2006.  \n \n \nApplicant received the SOR on January 4, 2011; answered it on January 25, \n2011; and requested a hearing before an administrative judge. DOHA received the \nJune 7, 2011\n\n \n2 \n \n \nrequest on January 27, 2011. Department Counsel was ready to proceed on February \n25, 2011, and the case was assigned to me on March 4, 2011. DOHA issued a notice of \nhearing on March 17, 2011, scheduling it for April 6, 2011. I convened the hearing as \nscheduled. Government Exhibits (GX) 1 through 14 were admitted without objection. \nApplicant testified and submitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AX) A through E, which were \nadmitted without objection. I kept the record open until April 22, 2011, to enable \nApplicant to submit additional documentary evidence. He timely submitted AX F through \nI, which were admitted without objection. Department Counsel\u2019s comments regarding \nAX F through I are attached to the record as Hearing Exhibit I. DOHA received the \ntranscript (Tr.) on April 13, 2011. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, \n1.e-1.i, and 1.o. He denied the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c, 1.d, 1.j-1.n, 1.p-1.s, and 2.a. \nHis admissions in his answer and at the hearing are incorporated in my findings of fact.  \n \n \nApplicant is a 49-year-old employee of defense contractor. He served in the U.S. \nNavy from June 1980 to June 2003 and retired as a chief petty officer. He has worked \ncontinuously for defense contractors since his retirement. He is a high school graduate \nand has completed about three years of college, working toward a bachelor\u2019s degree in \norganizational management. (Tr. 49-50.) He received a security clearance early in his \nNavy career and has held a clearance continuously until the present. \n \n \nApplicant married in June 1989. He and his wife have a daughter who is in \ncollege. Applicant paid her college expenses of about $2,400 per month for two years. \nShe now has a scholarship, and Applicant pays about $500 per month for her room and \nboard. (Tr. 49.)  \n \n \nApplicant and his wife were both employed while he was in the Navy. Relying on \ntwo incomes, they purchased a home, an automobile, and furniture for their home. Even \nwith two incomes, they were \u201chouse poor.\u201d (Tr. 54.) Applicant\u2019s wife became ill, was \ndiagnosed with multiple sclerosis, and became unable to work. Her income had \naccounted for about 38% of the family income, and they fell behind on their financial \nobligations. (Tr. 37-38.)  \n \nApplicant and his wife filed a Chapter 13 petition for bankruptcy in May 1996, and \nthey completed the payment plan in November 2000. (GX 5 at 67; GX 7 at 2; Answer to \nSOR.) This bankruptcy is alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a. \n \n \nWhen Applicant completed his first Chapter 13 bankruptcy, he still owned his \nhome, and he was obligated to pay his first and second mortgages. (Tr. 56.) He filed a \nsecond Chapter 13 petition for bankruptcy in March 2006, after he fell behind on his \nhome mortgage payments and the lender took steps to foreclose on the property. (GX \n5; GX 6; GX 8 at 4.) This bankruptcy was dismissed in May 2008 for failure to make the \nrequired payments. (GX 5 at 77-78.) This bankruptcy was alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b. \n\n \n3 \n \n \nApplicant presented evidence that medical problems cause about 62% of bankruptcies, \nand that it can take 10 to 20 years to recover from a bankruptcy. (AX A; AX B.) \n \n \nThe SOR \u00b6 1.d alleges that Applicant willfully failed to file federal tax returns for \ntax years 1999, 2000, 2002, 2003, 2005, and 2006. Applicant submitted IRS account \ntranscripts for tax years 1999 through 2005, showing that he filed his 1999 and 2005 \nreturns in 2006, and that the IRS prepared substitute returns for 2000, 2002, and 2003. \n(GX 4 at Enclosure 2.)  \n \n \nA summary of an interview with a security investigator in June 2007 reflects that \nApplicant told the investigator that he had filed his federal and state taxes every year \nand did not owe any penalties or taxes. In response to DOHA interrogatories asking him \nto verify the accuracy of the investigator\u2019s interview summary, Applicant submitted \nnumerous additions and corrections but did not dispute the accuracy of the summary \nregarding his state and federal tax returns. (GX 4, Enclosure 2.) At the hearing, he \ndenied saying that he filed his returns \u201cevery year.\u201d He testified he intended to say that \nall his tax returns had been filed as of the date of the interview. (Tr. 98-99.) \n \nIn March 2010, Applicant responded to DOHA interrogatories by submitting \ncopies of federal tax returns for 2000, 2002, 2003, and 2006 through 2009. None of \nthose copies are signed, dated, or bear indicia of mailing or receipt. (GX 4 at Document \n(5).) Applicant contends that he owed $724 for 2000, owed $143 for 2007, and owed \n$1,110 for 2009; and he was entitled to refunds of $593 for 2001, $1,558 for 2002, \n$1,971 for 2003, $2,188 for 2006, and $2,901 for 2008. These computations, if \naccurate, would produce a net refund rather than an unpaid tax debt, but they do not \ninclude any penalties or interest. In May 2011, he negotiated a payment plan of $100 \nper month while the amount of delinquent taxes, if any, is being computed. (AX G.)  \n \n \nThe SOR \u00b6 1.e alleges Applicant failed to file state tax returns for 2003, 2004, \nand 2005. He admitted this allegation, explaining that he was a legal resident of a state \nthat has no state income tax until he retired from the Navy in June 2003. After he moved \nto another state that has an income tax, he did not timely file his returns. He testified \nthat he had filed all his state tax returns, but he submitted no documentary evidence of \nfiling.  \n \n \nApplicant testified that he is \u201cchronically late\u201d in filing his tax returns. When he \nknows he owes money, he tends to delay filing until he can accumulate what he owes. \nHe admitted deliberately filing his federal income tax returns late, but he denied that he \nintended to not file his tax returns. (Tr. 61-62.) \n \n \nShortly before the hearing, Applicant received a settlement offer on the \nrepossession deficiency alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.g, and he negotiated a payment agreement \nfor the repossession deficiency alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.h. However, he had not made any \npayments on either debt as of the date the record closed. (AX H; AX I; Tr. 66-68.) \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \n \nApplicant was unsure when he purchased the foreclosed time-share property \nalleged in SOR \u00b6 1.k, but he \u201cassumed\u201d that it was before his bankruptcy in 2006. (Tr. \n76-77.) His December 2004 credit report reflects that his account with the lender was \nopened in February 2003 and the last activity was in April 2003. (GX 7 at 3.)  \n \n \nThe table below summarizes the evidence concerning the delinquent debts \nalleged in the SOR. \n \nSOR \nDebt \nAmount\nAnswer \nTo SOR \nStatus \nEvidence \n1.c \nFederal \nincome tax \n$8,106 \nDisputes \namount \nMaking payments  \nAX G \n1.f \nCable service \n$322 \nAdmit \nUnresolved \nTr. 65 \n1.g \nCar \nrepossession \n$2,802 \nAdmit \nSettlement offer for \n$1,000; no proof of \npayment \nAX I;  \nTr. 66-68 \n1.h \nCar \nrepossession \n$3,011 \nAdmit \nPayment agreement for \n$250 per month; no \nproof of payments \nAX H; \nTr. 66-68 \n1.i \nMedical \n$50 \nAdmit \nUnresolved \nTr. 68 \n1.j \nMedical \n$155 \nDeny \nUnresolved \nTr. 72-73 \n1.k \nTime share  \nforeclosure \n$9,526 \nDeny \nProperty sold, denies \ndeficiency; no dispute \nfiled with credit bureau \nGX 4 at  \nDoc (2);  \nTr. 74-80 \n1.l \nCredit card \n$438 \nDeny \nValidation requested; \nno response \nGX 4 at  \nDoc (5);  \nTr. 81-82 \n1.m \nCredit card \n$11,607 Disputes \namount \nValidation requested; \nno response from \ncreditor \nGX 4 at \nDoc (5); \nTr. 83 \n1.n \nCredit card \n$14,574 Disputes \namount \nUnresolved \nTr. 82-83 \n1.o \nCredit card \n$353 \nAdmit \nUnresolved \nGX 4 at  \nDoc (5); \nTr. 87 \n1.p \nMedical \n$3,162 \nDeny \nPending decision by \ninsurance company and \nTRICARE \nGX 4 at  \nDoc (2); \nTr. 87-89 \n1.q \nCell phone \n$342 \nDeny \nDebt may be cancelled, \nbut no documentation \nTr. 89 \n1.r \nCar loan \n$11,233 Deny \nMay be erroneous; no \ndispute filed with credit \nbureau \nTr. 90-91 \n1.s \nCredit card \n$469 \nDeny \nMay be included in 1.m; \nno documentation  \nTr. 92 \n\n \n5 \n \n \n \nIn October 2009, Applicant and his wife were able to sell their home and pay off \ntheir first and second mortgages. (GX 4, Documents at (3).) They now live in a rental \nhome. Their landlord submitted a statement that Applicant and his wife have been \u201cideal \ntenants\u201d and have paid their rent on time since they began their tenancy in August \n2009. (AX D.) \n \n \nApplicant was required by the bankruptcy court to complete online financial \ncounseling, and he recalled taking a financial counseling course while on active duty. \n(Tr. 99-100.) There is no evidence of any recent financial counseling. \n  \n \nIn May 2010, Applicant submitted a personal financial statement. It reflects gross \nhousehold income of $9,715 per month, taxes of $1,597, deductions of $906, and \nexpenses of $6,370, leaving a net monthly remainder of about $842. (GX 3 at 9.) In \nApril 2011, Applicant accepted an employment offer from a defense contractor at an \nannual gross pay of $134,000, which will increase his monthly gross pay by about \n$1,451 per month. (AX E.) In June 2010, Applicant submitted additional information \nreflecting that he would no longer be paying his daughter\u2019s college tuition after August \n2010, thereby reducing his monthly expenses by about $1,900 per month. (GX 2.) \n \nPolicies \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended.   \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the AG. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, \nrecognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies these \nguidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. \nOr. 10865 \u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the \napplicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense \nhave established for issuing a clearance. \n \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in \nthe personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant \nfrom being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden \nof establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 92-1106 \nat 3, 1993 WL 545051 at *3 (App. Bd. Oct. 7, 1993).   \n \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \n \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. \n01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, \nif they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).  \n \nAnalysis \n \n \nThe SOR alleges two Chapter 13 bankruptcies (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b), failure to \nfile federal and state tax returns as required (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d and 1.e), and 15 delinquent \ndebts, including a federal tax debt of about $8,106 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c, 1.f-1.s). Applicant \nadmitted the bankruptcies and filing his tax returns late. His credit reports and other \ndocumentary evidence show that the federal tax debt and several other debts are \nunresolved. \n \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18:  \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds. \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s financial history raises four disqualifying conditions under this \nguideline: \n \nAG \u00b6 19(a): inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; \n \nAG \u00b6 19(c): a history of not meeting financial obligations; \n \nAG \u00b6 19(e): consistent spending beyond one=s means, which may be \nindicated by excessive indebtedness, significant negative cash flow, high \ndebt-to-income ratio, and/or other financial analysis; and \n \nAG \u00b6 19(g): failure to file annual Federal, state, or local income tax returns \nas required or the fraudulent filing of the same.  \n \n \nSecurity concerns based on financial problems can be mitigated by showing that \n\u201cthe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual=s \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d AG \u00b6 20(a). This mitigating \ncondition is not established, because Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts are numerous and \nongoing, and they did not occur under circumstances making them unlikely to recur. \nThe illness of Applicant\u2019s wife was an unusual event, but it is ongoing and likely to \ncontinue. \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing that \u201cthe \nconditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person=s \ncontrol (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical \nemergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual acted responsibly \nunder the circumstances.\u201d AG \u00b6 20(b). Both prongs, i.e., conditions beyond the person=s \ncontrol and responsible conduct, must be established. The illness and incapacity of \nApplicant\u2019s wife was a condition beyond their control, but they were living on the \nfinancial edge when she became ill, and Applicant has not acted responsibly. He \nneglected to file his federal tax returns even though he believed he was entitled to \nrefunds for several years. He and his wife purchased a time-share property even though \nthey were living on a tight budget. He did not address his financial problems until he \nrealized that his security clearance was in jeopardy.  \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing that \u201cthe \nperson has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear \nindications that the problem is being resolved or is under control.\u201d AG \u00b6 20(c). Applicant \nreceived mandatory counseling in connection with his bankruptcies and attended \nfinancial management classes while he was on active duty in the Navy, but the second \nprong of this mitigating condition is not established, because Applicant\u2019s financial \nsituation is not yet under control. \n \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing that \u201cthe \nindividual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve \n\n \n8 \n \n \ndebts.\u201d AG \u00b6 20(d). Good faith means acting in a way that shows reasonableness, \nprudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation. ISCR Case No. 99-0201, 1999 \nWL 1442346 at *4 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 1999). An applicant is not required, as a matter of \nlaw, to establish resolution of every debt alleged in the SOR. An applicant need only \nestablish a plan to resolve financial problems and take significant actions to implement \nthe plan. There is no requirement that an applicant make payments on all delinquent \ndebts simultaneously, nor is there a requirement that the debts alleged in the SOR be \npaid first. See ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008). Evidence of \npast irresponsibility is not mitigated by payment of debts only under pressure of \nqualifying for a security clearance.   \n \nIn May 2011, Applicant made a payment agreement for his federal taxes, and he \nhas been making $100 payments per month while the amount of his indebtedness, if \nany, is determined. He negotiated agreements to settle the two car repossession \ndeficiencies alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.g and 1.h, but he had made no payments as of the \ndate the record closed. He testified he had resolved his state tax problem, but he \nsubmitted no documentation to corroborate his testimony. He claimed that the time-\nshare foreclosure alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.k was resolved by sale of the property, but he \nprovided no documentation that the debt is fully resolved. He is attempting to resolve \nthe medical debt in SOR \u00b6 1.p and related insurance issues. The remaining debts \nalleged in the SOR are unresolved. I conclude that AG \u00b6 20(d) is established for SOR \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.c and 1.p, but not for the remaining debts alleged in the SOR. \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing \u201cthe \nindividual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-due debt which is \nthe cause of the problem and provides documented proof to substantiate the basis of \nthe dispute or provides evidence of actions to resolve the issue.\u201d AG \u00b6 20(e). Applicant \ndenied the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.j-1.n, and 1.q-1.s, but he did not document the \nbasis of the disputes or provide evidence of actions to resolve them. I conclude AG \u00b6 \n20(e) is not established. \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \n \nThe SOR alleges that in June 2007 Applicant falsified material facts in an \ninterview with a security investigator by claiming that he had filed federal and state tax \nreturns every year and denying that he owed any unpaid taxes or penalties. The \nsecurity concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 15: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.   \n\n \n9 \n \n \nThe relevant disqualifying condition is AG \u00b6 16(b): \u201cdeliberately providing false or \nmisleading information concerning relevant facts to an employer, investigator, security \nofficial, competent medical authority, or other official government representative.\u201d When \na falsification allegation is controverted, as in this case, the Government has the burden \nof proving it. An omission or misstatement, standing alone, does not prove falsification. \nAn administrative judge must consider the record evidence as a whole to determine an \napplicant\u2019s state of mind at the time of the omission or misstatement. See ISCR Case \nNo. 03-09483 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 17, 2004).  \n \nApplicant had an opportunity to review the personal interview summary, which \nrecites that he \u201cadvised that he had filed his federal and state taxes every year and he \ndoes not owe any back penalty taxes or unpaid taxes,\u201d and he did not object to the \naccuracy of this recital in his response to DOHA interrogatories. However, I am not \nsatisfied that he understood the subtlety or significance of the language of the interview \nsummary. The IRS records reflect that he filed his overdue federal returns before the \ninterview. He had spent most of his adult life as a legal resident of a state that does not \nhave a state income tax. He did not realize that he was required to file state tax returns \nin his new legal residence after he retired from the Navy. His copies of his federal tax \nreturns indicated that he did not owe any federal taxes, and the amount of his tax \nliability, if any, is still undetermined. I conclude that deliberate falsification is not \nestablished by substantial evidence. Accordingly, I resolve SOR \u00b6 2.a in Applicant\u2019s \nfavor.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guidelines F and E in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors \nin AG \u00b6 2(a) were addressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional \ncomment. \n \n\n \n10 \n \n \n \nApplicant is a mature, well-educated adult, but he is financially unsophisticated. \nHe has been living on the financial edge for many years, and he has made some \nunwise decisions, such as purchasing a time-share vacation property while living on a \ntight budget. He is a self-admitted financial procrastinator. He has not maintained good \nrecords of his financial decisions. He was candid and sincere at the hearing, and his \ndemeanor was a factor in my determination that he did not intentionally falsify material \nfacts during his security interview. On the other hand, his track record of financial \nmismanagement and procrastination leaves me with doubts about his reliability and \ngood judgment. \n \n \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guidelines F and \nE, and evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude \nApplicant has refuted the allegations of falsification, but he has not mitigated the \nsecurity concerns based on financial considerations. Accordingly, I conclude he has not \ncarried his burden of showing that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to \ncontinue his eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): AGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.b: \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.d-1.o: \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.p:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.q-1.s: \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E (Personal Conduct):  \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to continue \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified \ninformation is denied. \n \n \n \n \nLeRoy F. Foreman \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Half of the \ndebt has been paid, is being paid, or are deferred student loans and the other half is \npart of a recently established repayment plan. Applicant has rebutted or mitigated the \ngovernment\u2019s security concerns under financial considerations.

Acting under the relevant Executive Order \nand DoD Directive,1 the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a \n \n \n \n1\n                                                          \n1 Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, \n1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative \nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the \nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \nMay 22, 2009\n\n \n \n \n2\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) on September 24, 2008, detailing security concerns under \nfinancial considerations. \n  \n \nOn November 4, 2008, Applicant answered the SOR, and requested a hearing. \nOn February 4, 2009, I was assigned the case. On February 19, 2009, DOHA issued a \nnotice of hearing scheduling the hearing which was held on March 17, 2009.  \n \n \nThe government offered Exhibits (Ex.) 1 through 6, which were admitted into \nevidence. Applicant testified on his own behalf and submitted Exhibits A through E, \nwhich were admitted into evidence. The record was held open to allow additional \ninformation from Applicant. On April 1, 2009, additional material was submitted. \nDepartment Counsel had no objection to the material, which was admitted into the \nrecord as Ex. F. On March 31, 2009, the transcript (Tr.) was received. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant denied the factual allegations in SOR \u00b6 1.e, \n1.t, and 1.x of the SOR. He admitted the factual allegations of the remaining SOR \nallegations. His admissions are incorporated herein. \n \n \nApplicant is a 36-year-old senior electrical installer who has worked for a defense \ncontractor since February 1998, and is seeking to maintain a secret security clearance. \n(Tr. 58) Applicant\u2019s co-workers, colleagues, supervisors, acquaintances, and friends \nstate: Applicant is very knowledgeable, a tremendous asset to the program, voluntarily \nworks whatever hours it takes to achieve the desired goal, is well respected, a person of \ngreat character and integrity, hardworking, and honest. (Tr. 71, Ex. D) For the review \nperiod ending on December 31, 2008, his work performance was rated as far exceeding \nexpectations. \n \n \nThe SOR lists 27 past due or placed for collection accounts totaling \napproximately $63,000. Six of the debts have been listed twice. These duplicates are \nlisted under different creditors or in different SOR paragraphs. In November 1997, \nApplicant was discharged from the Navy and in February 1998, started his current job. \n(Ex. F) In July 2002, Applicant\u2019s 1998 Chevrolet truck was repossessed after its \ntransmission failed and would have required $1,800 in repairs. (Tr. 73) This debt is \nlisted twice in the SOR. The $8,726 debt (SOR \u00b6 1.l) is a company owed by the \ncompany listed in SOR \u00b6 1.x ($6,646). (Tr. 40-41, Ex. F) The $6,646 has been \ntransferred to a collection agency included in a debt settlement program. (Tr. 43, Ex. B) \nIn January 2003, a car was repossessed due to financial difficulties incurred when his \nson was born prematurely and experienced medical problems. His wife was unable to \nwork for four months. (Tr. 74, Ex. F)  \n \n \nIn April 1999, Applicant\u2019s wife had kidney surgery. In November 2001, Applicant \nhad ankle surgery. In March 2004, Applicant had back surgery and was on sick leave \nfor six months. While on medical leave, he received 60% of his salary, which did not \n\n \n \n \n3\ncover the bills. (Tr. 75, 76) Two months later, in June 2004, his wife broke her ankle. \n(Tr. 75, Ex. F) \n \n \nIn 2006, Applicant\u2019s electrical utility bill greatly increased to $650 to $700 \nmonthly. (Tr. 23, 64) As a result, in January 2007, Applicant sought the protection of a \nChapter 13, wage earner\u2019s plan bankruptcy. Applicant could not afford the $1,500 \nmonthly payment due to his $1,100 monthly mortgage, a $300 car payment, $355 \nmonthly truck payment, and utility bills. (Tr. 24) The bankruptcy was converted to a \nChapter 7, which was later dismissed. (Ex. A) The bankruptcy lists $181,000 in assets \nand $230,000 in liabilities (Ex. 6) Between the time of the conversion to Chapter 7, both \nApplicant and his wife received raises at work. Additionally, his wife\u2019s boss quit which \nresulted in his wife doing more overtime. (Tr. 25) With the additional income Applicant \nand his wife no longer qualified for the Chapter 7 bankruptcy. (Ex. A)  \n \n \nWhen the bankruptcy was dismissed the truck and car were repossessed and the \nhome went to foreclosure. (Tr. 63) Following the resale of the home, the mortgage \nholder has not contacted Applicant. (Tr. 65) Following repossession, the truck sold for \n$20,000 and the car for $10,000 leaving a debt of $5,800. (Tr. 69) Applicant has been \nmaking $100 monthly payments to the credit union on this obligation. Applicant intends \nto include this debt in the debt payment arrangement. (Ex. B)  \n \n \nIn March 2009, six months after receiving the SOR and a month after receiving \nthe Notice of Hearing, Applicant sought the assistance of a financial company. The plan \naddresses a total debt of $33,894 and requires paying $510 for 43 months and paying a \n$1,694 retainer fee by three installments of $495 each. (Tr. 27, Ex. B) Following the \nhearing, on March 31, 2009, the first payment ($495) of the retainer fee was made to \nthe financial company. (Ex. F) Once sufficient funds were accumulated, the finance \ncompany will attempt to negotiate a settlement with Applicant\u2019s creditors. (Tr. 34)  \n \nAccounts included in the debt settlement program include the following debts: the \n$697 medical debt (SOR \u00b6 1.b and 1.g); $427 (SOR \u00b6 1.j); the $714 telephone bill (SOR \n\u00b6 1.m); $689 (SOR \u00b6 1.z); $591 (SOR \u00b6 1.aa); $8,726 (SOR \u00b6 1.l); $5,549 (SOR \u00b6 1.y), \nwhich Applicant asserts was his wife\u2019s debt prior to their marriage; the $8,373 Ford \nrepossession debt (SOR \u00b6 1.o); $5,400 (SOR \u00b6 1.f); and the $2,380 debt (SOR \u00b6 1.u) is \nlisted although it is being collected by a different collection agency. (Ex. B, F)  \n \n \nIn October 2008, the $1,455 debt (SOR \u00b6 1.e) was paid. (Ex. B) This debt is the \nsame obligation as the debt listed in SOR \u00b6 1.n. ($1,505). (Tr. 40) The original debt \nlisted on Applicant\u2019s credit bureau reports (CBRs) (Ex. 2, 3, 4) is a collection agency \ndebt (SOR \u00b6 1.5) and lists the same debtor listed in SOR \u00b6 1.e. Additionally, schedule F \nof the bankruptcy indicates the $1,505 creditor (SOR \u00b6 1.n) is the same debt collected \nby the collection agency. (Ex. B) In September and November 2008, the $432 debt \n(SOR \u00b6 1.d, also listed in 1.h) was paid. (Ex. B) On February 1, 2009, the U.S. \nTreasury, through the Department of Navy, offset a $360 military credit card (SOR \u00b6 1.t) \nwhich reduced the balance to zero. (Ex. B) In March 2009, the $177 insurance bill (SOR \n\u00b6 1.i) and the $151 YMCA debt (SOR \u00b6 1.c) were paid. (Ex. F) \n\n \n \n \n4\n \n \nApplicant\u2019s wife obtained five student loans which represent seven of the SOR \ndebts. Those accounts were: $2,133 (SOR \u00b6 1.k); $4,000 (SOR \u00b6 1.p, which is the \nsame debt as SOR \u00b6 1.r); $3,500 (SOR \u00b6 1.q, which is the same debt as SOR \u00b6 1.s); \n$2,057 (SOR \u00b6 1.v); and $1,313 (SOR \u00b6 1.w). The student loans, which total \napproximately $15,000, are being deferred. (Ex. E, F) Applicant is repaying a loan from \nhis 401(k) retirement plan at a rate of $100 per month. He owes approximately $4,600 \non the loan. (Tr. 47)  \n \n \nIn July 2008, Applicant answered written interrogatories (Ex. 5) and indicated he \nhad made a payment arrangement with three of the creditors (SOR \u00b6 1.f, $5,852, which \nby March 2009, had been reduced by $400; SOR \u00b6 1.e; SOR \u00b6 1.n, which was paid off \nin October 2008; and another creditor which was paid off before the SOR was issued.)  \n \n \nApplicant pays $343 per month on a 2001 truck. (Tr. 50) He also has a 1997 car \nwhich is paid for. (Tr. 77) Applicant and his wife purchased a mobile home and five \nacres for $77,000. Because of their poor credit, the loan company would not transfer the \ntitle to Applicant and his wife. (Tr. 48) Applicant pays $688 per month on a two year \nlease on the property. (Tr. 49) The mobile home needed extensive repairs to the \nbathroom. In December 2008, Applicant was unable to make payments on some of his \ndebt due to making the bathroom repairs. (Tr. 52)  \n \n \nApplicant receives $125 monthly in VA disability. (Tr. 54) Applicant\u2019s wife is a \ncorporate trainer. (Tr. 59) She has been with the company since 2005 and makes \n$29,000 a year. (Tr. 60)  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \n\n \n \n \n5\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \n \nRevised Adjudicative (AG) \u00b6 18 articulates the security concerns relating to \nfinancial problems: \n \nFailure or inability to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds. \n \nAdditionally, an individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, negligent, or careless in properly handling and \nsafeguarding classified information. Behaving responsibly or irresponsibly in one aspect \nof life provides an indication of how a person may behave in other aspects of life.  \n \n\n \n \n \n6\nA person\u2019s relationship with his creditors is a private matter until evidence is \nuncovered demonstrating an inability or unwillingness to repay debts under agreed \nupon terms. Absent evidence of strong extenuating or mitigating circumstances, an \napplicant with a history of serious or recurring financial difficulties is in a position of risk \nthat is inconsistent with holding a security clearance. An applicant is not required to be \ndebt free, but is required to manage his finances so as to meet his financial obligations. \n \n \nThe SOR lists 27 past due or collection accounts that totaled $63,000. The \nrecord evidence supports a conclusion Applicant has a history of financial problems. \nApplicant\u2019s history of delinquent debt is documented in his credit reports, his interview \nby an Office of Personnel Management (OPM) investigator, his SOR response, his \nresponse to interrogatories, and his testimony. Disqualifying Conditions AG \u00b6 19(a), \n\u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts\u201d and AG \u00b619(c), \u201ca history of not meeting \nfinancial obligations,\u201d apply.  \n \n \nFive Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions under AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a) \u2013 (e) are \npotentially applicable: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control; \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \nApproximately half the SOR debt was paid or being paid or is deferred student \nloans. The remaining half was part of the repayment plan. Applicant paid five debts \n($3,415) plus two debts that were duplications ($1,937) for a total of $5,352 and is \nmaking payment on one additional debt ($5,400). Applicant\u2019s wife\u2019s student loans \n(seven totaling $13,000 plus two duplicates totaling $7,500) which total approximately \n$20,000 of the SOR debts are being deferred. Nine debts that total approximately \n\n \n \n \n7\n$27,000 plus two duplications ($7,343) that combined total more than $34,000 of the \nSOR debts are included in a repayment plan.  \n \nFollowing the hearing, Applicant made his first payment to the repayment plan. \nOnce sufficient funds are accumulated the finance company will attempt to negotiate \npayments on his delinquent accounts. The future of additional payments to the \nrepayment plan is uncertain. The likelihood an individual will continue making payments \ncan be judged by that individual\u2019s past conduct. Applicant has made a single payment; \nhowever, he earlier attempted to address his financial problems through bankruptcy \nwhich was filed In January 2007. Even though the bankruptcy was dismissed and \nApplicant\u2019s debts were not discharged, Applicant was attempting to address his financial \nproblems before the SOR was issued.  \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 20(a), Applicant=s financial problems were contributed to by the large \nincrease in his electric bill and his son\u2019s premature birth and associated medical \nproblems that resulted in his wife being unable to work for four months. These types of \ndebts are unlikely to recur. AG \u00b6 20(a) has some applicability. \n \nUnder AG & 20(b), Applicant did not experience unemployment, but his wife was \nunable to work for four month following the premature birth of his son. AG & 20(b) \napplies. \n \nUnder AG & 20(c) and & 20(d), Applicant has paid seven of the debts and is \nmaking payment on another debt. This is evidence which shows Aa good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.@ The student loans are in \ndeferment. The remaining nine debts plus two duplicate debts are part of a repayment \nplan. The repayment plan, although belated, is in place and Applicant is paying into that \nplan. With the repayment plan in place, there is an indication that the problem is being \nresolved and is under control. AG & 20(c) and & 20(d) apply. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n\n \n \n \n8\n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.  \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Half of the SOR debt has been paid, \nis being paid, or are deferred student loans and the other half is part of a repayment \nplan. The repayment plan is recent, but Applicant attempted to address his financial \nproblems two years ago with his bankruptcy filing.

On September 19, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings\nand Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security\nconcerns under Guideline G for Applicant. The action was taken under Executive Order\n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as\namended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel\nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the\nrevised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29,\n2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September\n1, 2006. \n \nThe Applicant responded to the SOR on a date uncertain, and he requested a\nhearing before a DOHA Administrative Judge.  This case was assigned to the\nundersigned on October 29, 2008.  A notice of hearing was issued on October 30, 2008,\nscheduling the hearing for December 10, 2008.  At the hearing the Government\npresented seven exhibits, referred to Government Exhibits 1 to 7.  The Applicant\npresented no exhibits but did testify on his own behalf.  The official transcript (Tr.) was\n\n2\nreceived on December 19, 2008.  Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings,\nexhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\nMOTION TO AMEND\nDepartment Counsel moved to amend the SOR by adding Guideline E, Personal\nConduct, paragraph 2(a).  The specific allegation under this guideline alleged that the\nApplicant intentionally and deliberately provided false information to a law enforcement\nofficer during his arrest of April 18, 1982, (previously referenced in Guideline G,\nparagraph 1(b)), when he was charged with (1) Driving Under the Influence of Alcohol -\nCausing Death or Injury to Another, a felony, and (2) Driving Under the Influence of\nAlcohol with.10% or more.  The Applicant had no objection to the amendment and when\noffered additional time to respond to the allegation, rejected such.  (Tr. pp 37-39).  The\nmotion to amend was granted. \nFINDINGS OF FACT\nThe Applicant is 51 years old and has a high school diploma and an Associate of\nScience Degree in Aviation Maintenance Technology.  He is employed by a defense\ncontractor as an Aircraft Flight Line Inspector, and is applying for a security clearance in\nconnection with his employment.\nThe Government opposes the Applicant's request for a security clearance, on the\nbasis of allegations set forth in the Statement of Reasons (SOR).  The following findings\nof fact are entered as to each paragraph and guideline in the SOR:\nParagraph 1 (Guideline G - Alcohol Consumption).  The Government alleges that the\nApplicant is ineligible for clearance because he abuses intoxicants.\nThe Applicant began consuming alcohol at the age of twenty one in 1978.  His\nhistory of excessive alcohol abuse continued off and on until at least 2006.  During this\nthirty year period, the Applicant was charged, arrested and convicted for six alcohol\nrelated offenses that include, five DUI\u2019s and one Drunk in Public, among other related\ncharges.  Over the years, the Applicant has tried to abstain from the use of alcohol but\nhas always relapsed.  Applicant did not believe that he was an alcoholic or even that he\nhad an alcohol problem until his most recent arrest in 2005.  The following facts outline\neach arrest.\n \nThe Applicant was arrested on April 18, 1982, and charged with (1) Driving\nUnder the Influence of Alcohol - Causing Death or Injury to Another, a felony, and (2)\nDriving Under the Influence of Alcohol with.10% or more.  Applicant contends he and a\nfriend had been consuming alcohol at the drag races.  (Tr. p. 36).  He states that he was\nnot driving the vehicle, but was a passenger at the time.  He \u201cbit the bullet\u201d for the driver\nbecause the driver did want to lose his security clearance and he was promised a job if\nhe did.  (Tr. p. 29).  The driver hit a car and injured several people in it.  Upon impact,\n\n3\nthe ice chest in the back of his car came out and beer went all over the place.  The\nApplicant pled nolo contendere to Count (1) and was ordered to pay fine/fee of\napproximately $600.00, serve 100 hours of community service, make restitution of\napproximately $8,537.48, complete the first offenders program, and his driver\u2019s license\nwas restricted for 90 days.  Count 2 was dismissed.  Upon successful completion of\nthree years of formal probation, the charge was reduced to a misdemeanor.\n(Government Exhibits 3 and 4).\nApplicant second arrest occurred on July 3, 1986.  He was charged with (1)\nDrunk in Public and (2) Possession of Marijuana.  Applicant explained that he had\ntented his house for termites, and was sitting in his car at a park where he had\nconsumed two beers.  Four beers were still unopened on the seat.  There were no keys\nin the ignition.  A police officer came to the Applicant\u2019s car door.  Applicant stated that at\nsome point, the officer put a gun to his head.  Applicant was searched for weapons and\nthen placed in the police car.  Marijuana was confiscated.  Applicant later learned that\nan officer was killed at a gas station just up the street from where he was arrested and\nhe was a possible suspect.  The Applicant was found guilty of Count 1 and ordered to\npay a fine of approximately $340.00 and was placed on three years probation.\n(Government Exhibits 4 and 5).\nApplicant\u2019s third arrest took place on October 26, 1989.  He was charged with (1)\nDriving Under the Influence of Alcohol/Drug.  Applicant had been drinking at a company\nparty before he was arrested.  He pled nolo contendere to Reckless Driving - Alcohol\nRelated.  He was found guilty and ordered to pay a fine of approximately $364.00.\n(Government Exhibits 5 and 6).\nApplicant was arrested a fourth time on September 19, 1994, and charged with\n(1) Driving Under the Influence of Alcohol/Drug.  Again, the Applicant had consumed too\nmuch beer before driving his vehicle.  He pled guilty and was placed on three years\nprobation, fined $1,114.00, his drivers license was restricted for 90 days and he was\nordered to enroll and complete an alcohol program.  (Government Exhibit 7).  \nThe Applicant was ordered by the court to participate in an alcohol treatment\nprogram.  He attended a program from July 1994 to at least November 1994.  He\ncompletely abstained from the use of alcohol during this six month period.  (Tr. p. 50).\nApplicant states that his priest believed that he should quit drinking.  (Tr. p 52).\nApplicant stopped for a while and then returned to social drinking.    \nOn July 6, 1996, Applicant was arrested a fifth time.  He was arrested and\ncharged with (1) Driving Under the Influence of Alcohol, and (2) Driving Under the\nInfluence of Alcohol with .10% or more.  He pled nolo contendere and was placed on\nthree years probation, sentenced to serve fifteen days in jail and fined $1,249.00, his\ndriver\u2019s license was restricted for one year and he was ordered to complete an 18\nmonth second offender alcohol program.  (Applicant\u2019s Answer to SOR).   \n\n4\nThe Applicant attended a court ordered alcohol counseling program from\nFebruary 12, 1997, to at least September 4, 1998.  Following this treatment program he\nabstained from using alcohol almost nine years from 1996 to 2005.   \nApplicant\u2019s sixth and final arrest occurred on June 4, 2005.  He was charged with\n(1) Driving Under the Influence of Alcohol/Drugs with Priors, (2) Driving Under the\nInfluence of Alcohol with Blood Content .08% or Higher with Priors, and (3) Possession\nof Marijuana.  Applicant believes that he was targeted and set up for this arrest.\nApplicant explained that his father had died and he was coming back from Las Vegas,\nwhen he was stopped for swerving and for an expired registration.  Applicant has\nconsumed part of a bottle of champaign as a toast to his father and poured the rest on\nhis father\u2019s uniform.   After the Applicant was arrested and taken to jail, he was asked to\nsign the report which he refused to do.  Applicant states that the officer then put a taser\nto his testicles to force him to sign.  The Applicant signed.  Applicant indicates that he\ndid not press charges against the police officer because he did not want retribution.  (Tr.\nP. 56-58).  He pled guilty to Count 2 and was sentenced to a conditional and revocable\nrelease for a period of three years, to serve 30 days in jail with credit for one day\nserved, pay a fine/fee of approximately $1,513.00, attend and complete a multiple\noffender alcohol program.  His driver\u2019s license was restricted for 18 months and he was\nordered to report to a rehabilitation center for weekender/work release program.  Counts\n(1) and (3) were dismissed.  (Government Exhibits 2 and 3).   \nThe Applicant attended another court ordered alcohol counseling program from\nMarch 10, 2006, to October 8, 2007.  \nApplicant last consumed alcohol sometime in 2006.  He no longer consumes it\nand does not miss it.  (Tr. P. 65).  He does not attend Alcoholics Anonymous nor is he\ninvolved in any alcohol treatment program.  He lives with his girlfriend in a mountain\ncabin and has no friends.  Most of them are dead from the war or law enforcement.  (Tr.\nP. 71).  His two dogs are is therapy.  He now admits that by definition he is an alcohol.   \nParagraph 2 (Guideline E - Personal Conduct).  The Government alleges that the\nApplicant is ineligible for clearance because he engaged in conduct involving\nquestionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules\nand regulations that raise questions abut his ability to protect classified information.\nThe Applicant intentionally and deliberately provided false information to a law\nenforcement officer during his arrest of April 18, 1982, when he was charged with (1)\nDriving Under the Influence of Alcohol - Causing Death or Injury to Another, a felony,\nand (2) Driving Under the Influence of Alcohol with.10% or more.  Applicant told the\nofficer that he was the driver of the vehicle when he was the passenger in the car at the\ntime of the incident.  (Tr. pp. 39 - 40).  The Applicant admitted that he lied to the officer\nas a favor to the driver of the vehicle since that person had promised the Applicant a\njob.    \n\n5\nPolicies\nEnclosure 2 and Section E.2.2. of the Directive sets forth adjudication policies divided\ninto \"Disqualifying Factors\" and \"Mitigating Factors.\"  The following Disqualifying Factors\nand Mitigating Factors are found to be applicable in this case:\nGuideline G (Alcohol Consumption)\n21.  The Concern.  Excessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of\nquestionable judgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about\nan individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness.  \nConditions that could raise a security concern:\n22. (a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under the\ninfluence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other incidents of\nconcern, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or\nalcohol dependent;\n22. (c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired judgment,\nregardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol\ndependent.\nConditions that could mitigate security concerns:\nNone.\nGuideline E (Personal Conduct)\n15.  The Concern.  Conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor,\ndishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified\ninformation.  Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful and candid answers\nduring the security clearance process or any other failure to cooperate with the security\nclearance process.\nCondition that could raise a security concern:\n16.(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information concerning relevant\nfacts to an employer, investigator, security official, competent medical authority, or other\nofficial government representative.\nCondition that could mitigate security concerns:\nNone.\n\n6\nIn addition, as set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive at pages 16-17,  in\nevaluating the relevance of an individual\u2019s conduct, the Administrative Judge should\nconsider the following general factors:\na. The nature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding circumstances\nb. The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation\n \nc. The frequency and recency of the conduct\nd. The individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct\ne. The voluntariness of participation\nf. The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavior\nchanges\ng. The motivation for the conduct \nh. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress\ni. The likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nThe eligibility criteria established in the DoD Directive identify personal\ncharacteristics and conduct which are reasonably related to the ultimate question,\nposed in Section 2 of Executive Order 10865, of whether it is \u201cclearly consistent with the\nnational interest\u201d to grant an Applicant\u2019s request for access to classified information.\nThe DoD Directive states, \u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a\nsufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the person is\nan acceptable security risk.  Eligibility for access to classified information is predicted\nupon the individual meeting these personnel security guidelines.  The adjudicative\nprocess is the careful weighing of a number of variables known as the whole person\nconcept.  Available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable\nand unfavorable should be considered in reaching a determination.\u201d The Administrative\nJudge can draw only those inferences or conclusions that have reasonable and logical\nbasis in the evidence of record.  The Judge cannot draw inferences or conclusions\nbased on evidence which is speculative or conjectural in nature.  Finally, as emphasized\nby President Eisenhower in Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under this order\n. . . shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a\ndetermination as to the loyalty of the Applicant concerned.\u201d\nCONCLUSION\nIn the defense industry, the security of classified industrial secrets is entrusted to\ncivilian workers who must be counted upon to safeguard such sensitive information\ntwenty-four hours per day, seven days per week.  The Government is therefore\n\n7\nappropriately concerned when available information indicates that an Applicant for\nclearance may be involved in alcohol abuse and dishonesty that demonstrates poor\njudgment or unreliability.\nIt is the Government\u2019s responsibility to present substantial evidence to support\nthe finding of a nexus, or rational connection, between the Applicant\u2019s conduct and the\ncontinued holding of a security clearance.  If such a case has been established, the\nburden then shifts to the Applicant to go forward with evidence in rebuttal, explanation\nor mitigation, which is sufficient to overcome or outweigh the Government\u2019s case.  The\nApplicant bears the ultimate burden of persuasion in proving that it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant him a security clearance.\nIn this case the Government has met its initial burden of proving that the\nApplicant has engaged in alcohol abuse (Guideline G) and dishonesty (Guideline E).\nThis evidence indicates poor judgment, unreliability and untrustworthiness on the part of\nthe Applicant.  Because of the scope and nature of the Applicant's conduct, I conclude\nthere is a nexus or connection with his security clearance eligibility.\nConsidering all of the evidence, the Applicant has not introduced persuasive\nevidence in rebuttal, explanation or mitigation that is sufficient to overcome the\nGovernment's case under Guidelines G and E of the SOR.\nUnder Alcohol Abuse, Guideline G, disqualifying conditions 22(a), \u201calcohol-\nrelated incidents away from work, such as driving while under the influence, fighting,\nchild or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other incidents of concern, regardless of\nwhether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent\u201d and,\n22(c), \u201chabitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired judgment,\nregardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol\ndependent\u201d apply. None of the mitigating conditions are applicable. Accordingly\nGuideline G is found against the Applicant. \nThe Applicant\u2019s history of alcohol abuse began over thirty years ago and has\nresulted in numerous incidents of intoxication, some of which he was arrested for,\nothers he was not.  His alcohol history involves six alcohol related arrests, including five\narrests for DUI and one Drunk in Public.  His last arrest occurred in 2005, just three\nyears ago.  Applicant contends that he has now permanently stopped drinking.  He\nattended three separate court ordered treatment programs for his alcohol problem.\nSince then, however, he is not working a structured recovery program that includes\nAlcoholics Anonymous meetings or any other recognized alcohol rehabilitation program.\nHe has moved into a remote location in the mountains where he has no friends for\nemotional support.  Other than spending time with his dogs he does not have much\nelse.  He has tried to stop in the past and has not been successful.  Presently, he has\nabstained from the use of alcohol for the past two years and is commended for doing\nso.  However, given the extent of his alcohol abuse, more time is needed in\nrehabilitation to assure the government that he will not relapse once again.  Hopefully,\nthis time, the Applicant will be able to completely abstain from excessive alcohol abuse.\n\n8\nAlthough there is no formal diagnosis in the record of alcohol dependence, the\nApplicant\u2019s pattern of alcohol abuse is clearly indicative of a serious alcohol problem\nthat he still has not gained a true understanding of.  Based upon his long history of\nalcohol abuse and its related effects on the Applicant there is insufficient evidence in the\nrecord to show that he is sufficiently trustworthy for access to classified information at\nthis time.      \nUnder Personal Conduct, Guideline E, disqualifying condition 16.(b) deliberately\nproviding false or misleading information concerning relevant facts to an employer,\ninvestigator, security official, competent medical authority, or other official government\nrepresentative applies.  None of the mitigation conditions apply.\nThe Applicant intentionally and deliberately lied to the law enforcement officer\nduring his arrest in April 1982, without giving it a second thought.  This conduct was in\nviolation of Title 18, United States Code, Section 1001, a felony.\nI have also considered the \u201cwhole person concept\u201d in evaluating the Applicant\u2019s\neligibility for access to classified information.  Under the particular facts of this case, the\ntotality of the conduct set forth under all of the guidelines viewed as a whole, support a\nwhole person assessment of poor judgement, untrustworthiness, unreliability, an\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, and/or other characteristics\nindicating that the person may not properly safeguard classified information.\n  \nConsidering all of the evidence presented, it does not come close to mitigating\nthe negative effects of his alcohol problem and the impact that it can have on his ability\nto safeguard classified information.  On balance, it is concluded that the Applicant has\nfailed to overcome the Government's case opposing his request for a security\nclearance.  Accordingly, the evidence supports a finding against the Applicant as to the\nfactual and conclusionary allegations expressed in Paragraphs 1, and 2  of the SOR.    \n     \nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal findings For or Against the Applicant on the allegations in the SOR, as\nrequired by Paragraph 25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive are:\nParagraph 1: \nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.a.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.b.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.c.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.d.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.e.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.f.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.g.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.h.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.i.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n\n9\nParagraph 2: \nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  2.a.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for\nthe Applicant.\nDarlene Lokey-Anderson\nAdministrative Judge\n",

On March 2, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the trustworthiness concerns under\nGuidelines B and C regarding Applicant.  The action was taken under Executive Order\n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as\namended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel\nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive);\nDepartment of Defense (DoD) Regulation 5200.2-R, Personnel Security Program, dated\nJan. 1987, as amended (Regulation), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG)\n\n2\npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the\nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on March 9, 2009.  She answered\nthe SOR in writing on March 19, 2009, and requested a hearing before an\nAdministrative Judge.  DOHA received the request on April 13, 2009.  I received the\ncase assignment on May 4, 2009.  DOHA issued a notice of hearing on May 6, 2009,\nand I convened the hearing as scheduled on May 28, 2009.  The Government offered\nExhibits (GXs) 1 through 3, which were received without objection.  Applicant testified\non her own behalf and submitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibit (AppX) A, which was received\nwithout objection.  DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (TR) on June 2, 2009.  I\ngranted Applicant\u2019s request to keep the record open until June 11, 2009, to submit\nadditional matters.  On or about June 8, 2009, she submitted Exhibit B, which was\nreceived without objection.  The record closed on June 11, 2009.  Based upon a review\nof the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to sensitive\ninformation is granted.\nRequest for Administrative Notice\nDepartment Counsel submitted a formal request that I take administrative notice\nof certain facts relating to Russia.  The request was granted.  The request, and the\nattached documents, were not admitted into evidence but were included in the record.\nThe facts administratively noticed are set out in the Findings of Fact, below.\nFindings of Fact\nIn her Answer to the SOR, dated March 19, 2009, Applicant admitted all of the\nfactual allegations.  She also provided additional information to support her request for\neligibility for a public trust position.\nThe Applicant was born in Russia, but \u201cleft at age 32, in 1998\" (TR at page 24\nlines 10~17).  She came to the U.S. on a fiancee visa (TR at page 24 line 18 to page 28\nline 5).  She has since divorced her American spouse; but has two children, one from a\nprevious marriage, born in Russia, and the other born in the U.S. (Id).  She attended\ncollege in the U.S., and was naturalized in November of 2006 (TR at page 25 line 1 to\npage 26 line 20).\nThe Applicant owns a condo in the U.S. worth about $375,000 (TR at page 48\nline 5 to page 49 line 11, and AppX B at Encl 5).  Her net worth in the U.S. is about\n$100,000 (Id).  She has no assets in Russia, and stands to inherit nothing in Russia\n(TR at page 49 lines 3~11).\nShe summarizes her feelings about the U.S. in the following terms:\nYour Honor, my country is [the] United States.  I have everything\nhere -- my life, my children.  My daughter is get[ting] an education here.\nWe don\u2019t have nothing(sic) in Russia.  And my son even doesn\u2019t know\n\n3\n[the] Russian language at all.  So I have all my life, all my financial interest\nin this country, and I don\u2019t have anything to do with Russia anymore (TR\nat page 51 lines 8~14).\nGuideline B - Foreign Influence\n1.a., 1.d. and 2.b. The Applicant\u2019s parents are citizens and residents of Russia\n(GX 1 at pages 4~5).  Her 69 year old mother is retired from the railroad, from which\nshe receives a small government pension (TR at page 33 line 11 to page 35 line 22).\nHer mother never worked for the Russian/Soviet military, and she was never a member\nof the Communist Party (Id).  The Applicant\u2019s 70 year old father is also retired from the\nrailroad, with a small government pension (TR at page 35 line 23 to page 38 line 9).  He\nserved two years in the Soviet Army, about 50 years ago, but was never a member of\nthe Communist Party (Id).  The Applicant speaks to her parents about two to three\ntimes a month (TR at page 35 lines 2~7).\nThe Appellant visited her parents in Russia in 2003, 2005 and, most recently, in\n2008, in order for her children to see their grandparents (TR at page 43 line 16 to page\n45 line 24, and at page 47 line 3 to page 48 line 4).  Each time she used her Russian\npassport to enter and exit Russia (Id).\n1.d.  The Applicant\u2019s brother is also a citizen of and resides in Russia (TR at\npage 38 line 10 to page 40 line 15).  He is 37 years of age, and owns a small business\n(Id).  He served a year and a half in the Russian Army, but was never a member of the\nCommunist Party (TR at page 38 line 10 to page 40 line 15).  The Applicant has contact\nwith her brother about once every two months (TR at page 39 lines 7~9).\n1.e.  The Applicant has a 32 year old girl friend who is a citizen of and resides in\nRussia (TR at page 40 line 16 to page 43 line 15).  She works in a private bank, and\nwas never a member of the Communist Party (Id).  The Applicant contacts her girl\nfriend about three to four times a year (TR at page 40 lines 16~21).\nThe Applicant is not subject to coercion vis-a-vis her Russian relatives or her\nRussian girl friend (TR at page 50 lines 8~24).  None of Applicant\u2019s Russian relatives or\nher girl friend know that she has applied for a position of public trust.\nGuideline C - Foreign Preference\n2.a. and 2.b.  The Applicant was re-issued a Russian passport in July of 2005\n(TR at page 28 line 6 to page 29 line 12).  As she was not a naturalized U.S. citizen\nuntil November of 2006, she had to use her Russian passport to enter and exit Russia\nin 2003 and 2005 (Id).  Although she used her Russian passport to enter and exit\nRussia in 2008, she does not consider herself to be a Russian citizen anymore; and as\nsuch, is willing to renounce her Russian citizenship (TR at page 33 lines 3~10).  As\nevidence of her stated intention, she has destroyed her Russian passport (AppX B at\nEncl 2).  A photo copy of her destroyed Russian passport has been admitted into the\nrecord (Id).\n\n4\nI take administrative notice of the following facts: Russia is a federation\ncomposed of 21 republics.  The Government consists of a strong president, a prime\nminister, a bicameral legislature, and a weak judiciary.  Recently, tensions between the\nU.S. and Russia have escalated when Russia sent its army across as internationally\nrecognized boundary, to attempt to change by force the borders of Georgia, a country\nwith a democratically elected government.  Russia also has an active, recent, and\nongoing collection program that targets the U.S.  Beyond collection activities and\nespionage directed at the U.S., Russia provides certain technologies to other countries,\nsuch as China, Venezuela and Iran, in exchange for both money and diplomatic\ninfluence.\nPolicies\nPositions designated as ADP I and ADP II are classified as \u201csensitive positions\u201d\n(See Regulation \u00b6\u00b6 C3.1.2.1.1.7 and C3.1.2.1.2.3.).  \u201cThe standard that must be met for\n. . . assignment to sensitive duties is that, based on all available information, the\nperson\u2019s loyalty, reliability, and trustworthiness are such that . . . assigning the person to\nsensitive duties is clearly consistent with the interests of national security\u201d (See\nRegulation \u00b6 C6.1.1.1.).  The Deputy Under Secretary of Defense (Counterintelligence\nand Security) Memorandum, dated November 19, 2004, indicates trustworthiness\nadjudications will apply to cases forwarded to DOHA by the Defense Security Service\nand Office of Personnel Management.  Department of Defense contractor personnel\nare afforded the right to the procedures contained in the Directive before any final\nunfavorable access determination may be made (See Regulation \u00b6 C8.2.1.).\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a public trust position, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the\nAG.  These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process.  The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision.  According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d  The Administrative Judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\n[sensitive] information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d  In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based\non the evidence contained in the record.  Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d  The\n\n5\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable\ntrustworthiness decision.\nA person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence.  This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours.  The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to sensitive information.  Decisions include, by necessity, consideration\nof the possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard sensitive information.  Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nsensitive information.\nSection 7 of Executive Order (EO) 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin\nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty\nof the applicant concerned\u201d (See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple\nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information)).\nAnalysis\nGuideline B - Foreign Influence\nParagraph 6 of the new adjudicative guidelines sets out the security concern\nrelating to Foreign Influence: \u201cForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern\nif the individual has divided loyalties or foreign interests, may be manipulated or\ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way that is\nnot in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by a foreign interest.\u201d\nHere, Paragraphs 7(a) and 7(b) are applicable: \u201ccontacts with a foreign family\nmember . . . who is a citizen of or resident in a foreign country if that contact creates a\nheightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or\ncoercion;\u201d and \u201cconnections to a foreign person . . . that create a potential conflict of\ninterest between the individuals obligation to protect sensitive information or technology\nand the individual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person . . . by providing that information.\u201d\nThe Applicant\u2019s parents, brother and a girl friend are citizens and residents of Russia.\nThese are countered, however, by the first two mitigating conditions, as \u201cthe nature of\nthe relationships with foreign persons, the country in which these persons are located . .\n. are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a position of having to choose\nbetween the interests of a foreign individual . . . and the interests of the U.S;\u201d and \u201cthere\nis no conflict of interest [as] the individual has such deep and long lasting relationships\nand loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any conflict of\ninterest in favor of the U.S. interest.\u201d  The Applicant has clearly demonstrated that her\nnew life as an American citizen is in the U.S. with her family and possessions, and that,\nfor the most part, she has cut her connections with Russia.  Furthermore, the Applicant\naverred credibly that she could not be coerced by the presence of her parents, brother\nand girl friend in Russia by the Russian government.\n\n6\nGuideline C - Foreign Preference\nParagraph 9 of the new adjudicative guidelines sets out the security concern\nrelating to Foreign Preference: \u201cWhen an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a\npreference for a foreign country over the United States, then he or she may be prone to\nprovide information or make decisions that are harmful to the interests of the United\nStates.\u201d\nHere, Paragraph 10(a)(1) is applicable. \u201cexercise of any right, privilege or\nobligation of a foreign citizenship after becoming a U.S. citizen or through the foreign\ncitizenship of a family member.  This includes but is not limited to: (1) possession of a\ncurrent foreign passport; . . . .\u201d  This is clearly countered, however, by the mitigating\nconditions noted in Paragraphs 11(b) and 11(e).  Under 11(b), the Applicant \u201cexpressed\na [sincere] willingness to renounce dual citizenship;\u201d and under 11(e), the Applicant\u2019s\nRussian \u201cpassport has been destroyed . . . .\u201d\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a public trust position by considering the totality of the\nApplicant\u2019s conduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should\nconsider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature,\nextent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct,\nto include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct;\n(4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which\nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for\npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or\nrecurrence.\u201d Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility\nfor a public trust position must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon\ncareful consideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.\nHer Manager, avers, in part, the following:\nOver the last 10-months as . . . [the Applicant\u2019s] direct supervisor I\nhave come to know her to be a very dependable, trustworthy, hard\nworking member of our close knit team.  She plays a vital role in our\norganization of tracking and maintaining the current status of 100's of\ncontracts, a role that requires a great deal of attention and focus. . . . [the\nApplicant] has stepped into this role taking an active lead in protecting the\ncompany from risk (AppX A the last page).\nI considered all of the evidence, including the potentially disqualifying and\nmitigating conditions surrounding this case.  Overall, the record evidence leaves me\nwithout questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a public trust\nposition.  For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant has mitigated the trustworthiness\nconcerns arising from her alleged Foreign Influence and Foreign Preference.\n\n7\n\n8\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline B:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline C:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a public trust\nposition.  Eligibility for access to sensitive information is granted.\nRichard A. Cefola\nAdministrative Judge\n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is a 46-year-old employee of a government contractor for the Department of Defense. He has been employed as a heavy equipment operator on a military base since June 2007. He worked as a driver for several other employers before his current employment. He held a secret clearance while on active duty in the Air Force, but has not held one since his discharge. The circumstances that gave rise to this matter occurred 22 years ago in 1987 when he was a 24-year-old Air Force security policeman with the rank of sergeant (E-4). In the SOR, the government alleged that he was tried and convicted in 1987 by a general court-martial under the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ) larceny of a motorcycle, and sentenced to two years confinement, forfeiture of $1,000 and reduction in rank to airman basic (SOR \u00b6 1.a.). The SOR also alleged that he falsified material on his e-QIP when he answered Question 23 in the negative as to whether he had ever been convicted of a felony offense including one under the UCMJ (SOR \u00b6 2.a.).

Eligibility for access to classified information is\ngranted.\nStatement of the Case\n \nApplicant submitted an electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing)\n(eQIP), on June 13, 2007. On October 3, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and\nAppeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns\nfor Applicant under Guidelines J, and E. The action was taken under Executive Order\n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as\namended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel\nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and\nthe revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29,\n2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September\n1, 2006.\nMarch 27, 2009\n\n2\nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on October 25, 2008 and requested a\nhearing before an administrative judge. I received the case assignment on January 30,\n2009. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on February 3, 2009, for a hearing on February\n19, 2009. The hearing was held on that date. \nAt the hearing, the government offered three exhibits (Exhs 1-3) that were\nadmitted in evidence without objection. Applicant submitted no exhibits. He testified on\nhis own behalf. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on February 26, 2009.\nI granted Applicant\u2019s request to keep the record open until March 3, 2009, to submit\nadditional evidence. One set of documents (Exhs. A items 1-3) was received within that\ntime and admitted in evidence without objection.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 46-year-old employee of a government contractor for the\nDepartment of Defense. He has been employed as a heavy equipment operator on a\nmilitary base since June 2007. He worked as a driver for several other employers before\nhis current employment. He held a secret clearance while on active duty in the Air\nForce, but has not held one since his discharge. The circumstances that gave rise to\nthis matter occurred 22 years ago in 1987 when he was a 24-year-old Air Force security\npoliceman with the rank of sergeant (E-4). In the SOR, the government alleged that he\nwas tried and convicted in 1987 by a general court-martial under the Uniform Code of\nMilitary Justice (UCMJ) larceny of a motorcycle, and sentenced to two years\nconfinement, forfeiture of $1,000 and reduction in rank to airman basic (SOR \u00b6 1.a.).\nThe SOR also alleged that he falsified material on his e-QIP when he answered\nQuestion 23 in the negative as to whether he had ever been convicted of a felony\noffense including one under the UCMJ (SOR \u00b6 2.a.).\nIn his Answer, Applicant admitted the court martial and the sentence under the\ncriminal conduct allegation. He denied the personal conduct allegation for failure to\nreport the court martial conviction as a felony stating he did not know that the conviction\nwas for a felony. \nApplicant was on active duty in the Air Force between 1981 and 1991. In 1987 he\nowned a motorcycle that needed some extra parts. An acquaintance on the base where\nhe was stationed mentioned that there was a motorcycle of the same make that\nappeared to have been abandoned near one of the base gates but outside the fence on\nmilitary property (Tr. 19 and 60). He and several friends tried to see who owned the\nmotorcycle from the license plate and other identification (Tr. 21). They were unable to\nfind a record owner so they took the motorcycle away in Applicant\u2019s jeep, dismantled it\nfor the parts he needed, and put the remainder in a remote field on the base. The\nunused parts of the motorcycle were discovered several weeks later and traced to an\nowner who worked on the base (Tr. 40). \nApplicant was investigated, charged with larceny, and tried by a general court-\nmartial, found guilty of larceny in violation of 10 U.S.C.S. \u00a7 921, sentenced to a bad-\n\n3\nconduct discharge, confinement for two years, forfeiture of $100 pay per month for ten\nmonths, and reduction to the lowest enlisted grade. The conviction was affirmed by the\nCourt of Military Review and appealed to the Court of Military Appeals (COMA), which\nreversed the decision in 1989. He had served 13 months in confinement at the time of\nthe COMA decision. The findings of guilty and the sentence were set aside because of\nprejudicial errors made during the investigative phase of the case (29 M.J. 259, 1989),\nand Exh. 3). He then was restored to his old rank and given some military duties but\nlater placed on administrative leave when he worked as an ironworker for several\nmonths. One of the men who helped him take the motorcycle was also tried by court\nmartial and acquitted. \nThe record of the case was returned by COMA to The Judge Advocate General\nfor a possible re-hearing. A new trial was ordered and he was tried again in 1990. At\nthat trial Applicant again was found guilty and sentenced to ten months confinement, but\ncredited for the time already served. He was reduced in grade to airman basic. He was\nhonorably discharged in 1991 (Exh. A item 1, and Tr. 43-47).\nWhile the testimony at the hearing and the statements made in the investigation\n(Exhs. 2 and 3) differ on some of the issues involved in this matter, the outcome of the\ntwo trials and the appeals decisions are undisputed. Applicant has had no encounters\nwith the criminal justice system except for a few traffic tickets for the past 22 years. He\nhas a high school equivalency and has been employed primarily as a truck driver since\nhis discharge. He is remorseful about the event and realizes that it was a very stupid act\non his part that has continued to cause him difficulty. However, it was largely behind him\nuntil this matter arose (Tr. 71). He is now unemployed while he awaits medical\nclearance from a recent surgery to return to work if his security clearance is restored\n(Tr. 55). Applicant\u2019s supervisor attests to his work skills and that he is a trusted asset to\nhis employer (Exh. A Item 2). \nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\n\u201cthe whole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\n\n4\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or\nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision.\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship\ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off duty hours. The government\nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk\nif the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified\ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as\nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.\nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) listing multiple prerequisites for\naccess to classified or sensitive information. \nAnalysis\nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct\nThe security concern relating to criminal conduct is set out in AG\u00b6 30:\nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and\ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability or\nwillingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations.\nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns for an\napplicant. One of them that may be a disqualifying condition (DC) is a single serious\ncrime or multiple lesser offenses (AG \u00b6 31 (a)). The allegation in SOR \u00b6 1.a. relates to\nthe court martial in 1987 and the security concern has been properly raised. \nMitigating factors under the guideline that could be applicable are that so much\ntime has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened that it does not cast doubt on the\nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment (AG \u00b6 32 (a)), or there is\n\n5\nevidence of successful rehabilitation including, but not limited to passage of time without\nrecurrence of criminal activity, remorse, and a good employment record (AG \u00b6 32 (d)).\nThe second mitigating factor raises the issue of rehabilitation. The offense for which he\nwas prosecuted by court martial is the only criminal offense that he has committed.\nApplicant\u2019s conduct during the past 22 years has been without incident. The allegation in\nSOR \u00b6 1.a. is mitigated by the passage of time and evidence of rehabilitation. \nGuideline E Personal Conduct\nThe security concern about personal conduct is set out in AG & 15:  \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, and\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout and an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information (AG \u00b6 15).\nApplicant\u2019s failure to report the court martial conviction as a felony conviction at\nQuestion 23 on his SF 86, prompted security concerns under Guideline E (Personal\nConduct). Conditions that could raise a security concern and be disqualifying include the\ndeliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant and material facts from any\npersonnel security questionnaire (AG \u00b6 16 (a)). \nThe requirement of the guideline is that the omission be deliberately false. I\nconclude that it was not in view of the circumstances surrounding the history of the two\ncourt martial trials and appeals in his case. The likelihood of confusion as to the level of\nconviction supports his claim that he was unaware that he had been actually convicted of\na felony. \nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the\nconduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the\nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.\n\n6\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a\nsecurity clearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. I considered the\npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and\ncircumstances surrounding this case.\nApplicant presented testimony and evidence concerning his court martial in 1987\nand the subsequent one in 1990 including the differences in the penalties imposed, and\nhis preparation of the answers on his e-QIP. His work record has been steady and\ncontinuous for almost 20 years since he left active military service. He has had no further\nlaw enforcement problems in the past 22 years since his first trial. He has strong\nrecommendations from his supervisors for his work, conduct, and reputation. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as\nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline J:  FOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a.: For Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline J:  FOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a.: For Applicant\nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance. Access to classified information is granted. \nCHARLES D. ABLARD \nAdministrative Judge\n",

He has significantly greater contacts with the United States than with \nNigeria, where he was born, or with Sierra Leone, where some of his spouse\u2019s relatives \nlive. He can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest. \nForeign influence security concerns are mitigated. Eligibility for access to classified \ninformation is granted. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn May 11, 2007, Applicant submitted a Security Clearance Application (e-QIP \nversion) (hereinafter SF 86) (Government Exhibit (GE) 1). On December 10, 2008, the \nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) \nto him, alleging security concerns under Guideline B (Foreign Influence). The action \nwas taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry (February 20, 1990), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, \nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive); Department of Defense (DoD) Regulation 5200.2-R, Personnel \nMarch 23, 2009\n\n \n2 \n                                                                                                                                             \nSecurity Program, dated Jan. 1987, as amended (Regulation), and the revised \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and \neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \nThe SOR detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative \nfinding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant \nor continue a security clearance for him, and recommended referral to an administrative \njudge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or \nrevoked. \n \nOn January 5, 2009, Applicant responded to the SOR and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge. Department Counsel was prepared to proceed on \nFebruary 2, 2009. The case was assigned to me on February 3, 2009. On February 10, \n2009, DOHA issued a hearing notice. The hearing was held on March 2, 2009. At the \nhearing, Department Counsel offered three exhibits (GEs 1-3) (Transcript (Tr.) 24-25), \nand Applicant offered two exhibits (Tr. 28-29; AE A-B). There were no objections, and I \nadmitted GEs 1-3 (Tr. 26), and AEs A-B (Tr. 29-30). Additionally, I admitted the SOR, \nresponse to the SOR and the hearing notice (GEs 4-6). I received the transcript on \nMarch 13, 2009. I granted a delay until March 12, 2009, to permit Applicant to provide \nadditional letters from character references (Tr. 14-15, 19-20, 94). On March 19, 2009, I \nreceived an additional character reference (AE C). Department Counsel did not object \nto my consideration of AE C, and I admitted it into evidence. \n \nProcedural Rulings \n \nDepartment Counsel requested administrative notice of facts concerning the \nFederal Republic of Nigeria (hereinafter Nigeria) and Sierra Leone (Tr. 24, 26; GE 4, 5). \nDepartment Counsel provided supporting documents to show detail and context for \nthese facts in the Administrative Notice request. Applicant and Department Counsel did \nnot object to me taking administrative notice of the facts in the cover document \nprepared by Department Counsel and a map of Nigeria, as opposed to taking \nadministrative notice of all of the facts in all of the documents (Tr. 18, 79-80). See the \nNigeria and Sierra Leone sections of the Findings of Fact of this decision, infra, for the \nmaterial facts from Department Counsel\u2019s submissions on these two countries. \n \nAdministrative or official notice is the appropriate type of notice used for \nadministrative proceedings. See ISCR Case No. 05-11292 at 4 n.1 (App. Bd. Apr. 12, \n2007); ISCR Case No. 02-24875 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2006) (citing ISCR Case No. \n02-18668 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 10, 2004) and McLeod v.

His \nadmissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a complete and thorough \nreview of the evidence of record, I make the following findings of fact.   \n \nApplicant is 49 years old (Tr. 30). In 1979, he graduated from a high school in \nNigeria (Tr. 30). Applicant worked on his masters degree in financial management at a \nU.S. university for about a year in the late 1980s (Tr. 5-6, 32).

She is working on obtaining her \nU.S. citizenship (Tr. 36). She has a Liberian passport; however she has not traveled to \nLiberia or Sierra Leone since they were married in 1997 (Tr. 36-37).  \n \nApplicant\u2019s wife\u2019s mother, father, and sister are citizens of Liberia; however, his \nwife\u2019s mother and sister live in Sierra Leone in the same household (Tr. 36, 62, 64). His \nwife\u2019s mother has not visited the United States (Tr. 66). His wife calls her mother about \nfour times per year on the telephone (GE 3 at 5). His wife\u2019s sister is married, and his \nwife\u2019s sister\u2019s husband is a citizen of Sierra Leone (Tr. 65).

They are \ncurrent on their mortgage payments (Tr. 68). Applicant has a 401K retirement account \nwith his current employer, and a retirement plan with a previous U.S. employer (Tr. 68-\n \n1The facts in this decision do not specifically describe employment, names of witnesses or locations \nin order to protect Applicant and his family\u2019s privacy. The cited sources contain more specific information.  \n \n\n \n4 \n                                                                                                                                             \n69). Applicant pays his U.S. taxes and votes in U.S. elections (Tr. 69). He coaches his \nchildren\u2019s soccer team (Tr. 70-71). Applicant plans to retire in the United States (Tr. 71). \n \nApplicant\u2019s family members living in Nigeria \n \nIn 1996, Applicant\u2019s mother died in Nigeria (Tr. 37-38).

Applicant\u2019s brother, \nB, drives the bus that his father owns (Tr. 39-40). Applicant most recently spoke with his \nfather around Christmas of 2008 (Tr. 59). Applicant used to speak to his father about \nonce a month on the telephone; however, now they communicate less often because \nhis father\u2019s hearing is not very good (Tr. 59). None of Applicant\u2019s brothers, sisters, \nbrothers-in-law, or sisters-in-law have ever been in jail (Tr. 51).  \n \nApplicant talks to family members in Nigeria if there is an illness or big problem \n(Tr. 60). He might communicate with his brother, B, once a month (Tr. 60). They discuss \nfamily matters such as health, and how their children are doing (Tr. 72). They use the \ntelephone and not email or paper mail for their communications (Tr. 75).  \n \nApplicant\u2019s brothers, B and R, are citizens and residents of Nigeria (Tr. 45-46). B \nis not married and does not have any children.  B is not in the military, and does not \nwork for the government (Tr. 45). R is self-employed in importing and exporting (Tr. 47). \nR has an import/export license from the government (Tr. 48). R is married and has four \nchildren under the age of 18 (Tr. 49).  \n \nApplicant\u2019s sister, A, is a resident and citizen of Nigeria. A is married (Tr. 49).

A\u2019s \nother two children are under age 18 (Tr. 50).      \n \nApplicant\u2019s sister, C, is a resident and citizen of Nigeria. C is married and has \nthree children over the age of 18 (Tr. 52). One of C\u2019s children has graduated from \nuniversity and two of C\u2019s children are attending university (Tr. 53). C\u2019s husband is self-\nemployed in importing and exporting (Tr. 53). He has an import/export license from the \ngovernment (Tr. 53). The Nigerian government has never employed C\u2019s husband and \nhe has not served in the Nigerian military (Tr. 53-54).  \n  \nApplicant\u2019s sister, D, is a resident and citizen of Nigeria (Tr. 54). D is married and \nmanages a beauty salon (Tr. 54). D\u2019s husband works at a saw mill (Tr. 55).  D has three \nchildren over the age of 18 (Tr. 55).

The last time Applicant went \nto Nigeria was for his mother\u2019s funeral in 1997 (Tr. 56).  He will probably visit Nigeria \n\n \n5 \n                                                                                                                                             \nbefore his father dies, but does not intend to travel to Nigeria in 2009 (Tr. 61). Applicant \nsent some money to Nigeria when his mother was sick and about a year ago when his \nfather was sick he sent about $500 (Tr. 57). He does not provide any money to other \nNigerian family members because they do not need it (Tr. 72). He does not have any \nproperty in Nigeria (Tr. 58).    \n \nApplicant provided a character reference from a Training Coordinator employed \nby the contractor (AE A). She noted Applicant began his employment on in April 2007, \nand indicated Appellant \u201chas demonstrated a professional image without compromising \nthe integrity of his position. He has not displayed a behavior that would not deem him \nworthy to be granted a clearance with the government.\u201d  A Command Sergeant Major, \nwho has known Applicant for more than seven years, lauded his professional and \npositive attitude as well as his initiative and sound judgment (AE C).  \n \nNigeria \n \nNigeria is a federal republic that gained independence from Britain in 1960.  \nNigeria suffers from political instability, economic crisis, ethnic and religious conflict, \nextreme poverty, lack of law and order, judicial corruption and a history of military \ncoups. Nigeria has a poor human rights record. The military has ruled Nigeria for 28 of \nits 43 years since independence. In May 1999, Nigeria returned to civilian rule. Nigeria \nis Africa\u2019s largest oil producer, and conflict results from perceptions of uneven and/or \nunfair distribution of oil revenue.  Lawless elements have engaged in kidnapping for \nransom in the Niger Delta area. Heavily armed rival militias engage in conflict. The \nNigerian government has committed human rights violations, and security forces have \ncommitted politically motivated, extrajudicial killings as well as torture and arbitrary \narrest.     \n \nThe Niger Delta states are particularly noted for kidnappings by lawless \nelements. In 2008, the Nigerian Government detained U.S. citizens on six separate \noccasions after travel to the Niger Delta Region. \n \nSierra Leone \n \n \nSierra Leone is a republic with a multi-party system of government.  In 2002, a \ncivil war in Sierra Leone ended. United Nations peacekeepers left in December 2005, \nand the government now provides security. The government of Sierra Leone generally \nrespects the human rights of citizens; however, there have been reports of police \ncorruption and crime, and various situations where government agents or entities have \ncommitted serious human rights violations. The poor state of the economy has led many \nto turn to crime, and corruption occurs at all levels of government. \n \nPolicies \n \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the \nExecutive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security \nemphasizing, \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. \n\n \n6 \n                                                                                                                                             \nEgan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the \nauthority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine \nwhether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. \nat 527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.    \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the Applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not \ninflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common \nsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  \n \nThe government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. Clearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the [A]pplicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. \nOr. 10865 \u00a7 7. See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), Section 3. Thus, \nnothing in this Decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, \nin whole or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant\u2019s allegiance, \nloyalty, or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has not met the strict \nguidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a \nclearance. \n \nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the Applicant that may disqualify the Applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an Applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).      \n \nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the Applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An Applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd.

See ISCR Case No. \n\n \n7 \n                                                                                                                                             \n02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, \nif they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).   \n \nAnalysis \n \n  \nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all \nappropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, including those described briefly \nabove, I conclude Guideline B (Foreign Influence) is the relevant security concern with \nrespect to the allegations set forth in the SOR. \n \nForeign Influence \n \n  \nAG \u00b6 6 explains the security concern about \u201cforeign contacts and interests\u201d \nstating: \n \nif the individual has divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, [he or \nshe] may be manipulated or induced to help a foreign person, group, \norganization, or government in a way that is not in U.S. interests, or is \nvulnerable to pressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Adjudication \nunder this Guideline can and should consider the identity of the foreign \ncountry in which the foreign contact or financial interest is located, \nincluding, but not limited to, such considerations as whether the foreign \ncountry is known to target United States citizens to obtain protected \ninformation and/or is associated with a risk of terrorism. \n \nAG \u00b6 7 indicates three conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n \n(a) contact with a foreign family member, business or professional \nassociate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a \nforeign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign \nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to \nprotect sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s desire to \nhelp a foreign person, group, or country by providing that information; and  \n \n(d) sharing living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of \ncitizenship status, if that relationship creates a heightened risk of foreign \ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion. \n \nApplicant was born in Nigeria and traveled to Nigeria in 1997 for his mother\u2019s \nfuneral. He intends to travel to Nigeria at some time in the future before his father, who \nis 88, dies. He has two brothers and three sisters, who are residents and citizens of \nNigeria. He communicates with his father about once a month and to his siblings about \n\n \n8 \n                                                                                                                                             \n                                           \nonce a month using the telephone. They discuss family matters such as how their \nchildren are progressing and everyone\u2019s health.  \n \nHis spouse\u2019s mother, sister, brother-in-law and sister\u2019s family live in Sierra Leone \nand are citizens of Liberia and/or Sierra Leone. His spouse calls her mother about four \ntimes a year on the telephone.  \n \nThe mere possession of close family ties with a person in a foreign country is not, \nas a matter of law, disqualifying under Guideline B. However, if only one relative lives in \na foreign country, and an Applicant has contacts with that relative, this factor alone is \nsufficient to create the potential for foreign influence and could potentially result in the \ncompromise of classified information. See ISCR Case No. 03-02382 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. \n15, 2006); ISCR Case No. 99-0424 (App. Bd. Feb. 8, 2001).  \n \nThe nature of a nation\u2019s government, its relationship with the United States, and \nits human rights record are relevant in assessing the likelihood that an Applicant\u2019s family \nmembers are vulnerable to government coercion. The risk of coercion, persuasion, or \nduress is significantly greater if the foreign country has an authoritarian government, a \nfamily member is associated with or dependent upon the government, or the country is \nknown to conduct intelligence collection operations against the United States. The \nrelationships of Nigeria and Sierra Leone with the United States, place a significant, but \nnot insurmountable burden of persuasion on Applicant to demonstrate that his \nrelationship with his family in Nigeria and his spouse\u2019s relationship with her family living \nin Sierra Leone do not pose a security risk. Applicant should not be placed into a \nposition where he might be forced to choose between loyalty to the United States and a \ndesire to protect his family members living in a foreign country from harm or coercion.2 \nWith their negative human rights record, and high levels of crime in Nigeria and Sierra \nLeone as well as other political, economic and military problems in these counytries, it is \nconceivable that anyone living in Nigeria or Sierra Leone might be targeted by \ngovernmental or non-governmental, criminal elements in an attempt to gather \ninformation from the United States. \n \nWhile there is no evidence that intelligence operatives from Nigeria or Sierra \nLeone seek classified or economic information from United States\u2019 businesses, \nApplicant\u2019s connections to his family living in Nigeria and his wife\u2019s family living in Sierra \nLeone create a potential conflict of interest because his relationship is sufficiently close \nto raise a security concern about his desire relatives living in Nigeria or Sierra Leone by \nproviding sensitive or classified information.    \n \n \n2 An applicant with relatives in Iran, for example, has a much heavier burden to overcome than an \napplicant with relatives living in Nigeria. See ISCR Case No. 02-13595 at 3 (App. Bd. May 10, 2005) \n(stating an applicant has \u201ca very heavy burden of persuasion to overcome the security concerns\u201d when \nparents and siblings live in Iran). See also ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 4 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) \n(articulating \u201cvery heavy burden\u201d standard when an applicant has family members living in Iran); ISCR \nCase No. 07-12471 at 9 (A.J. May 30, 2008) (listing recent cases involving U.S. citizens with Iranian \nconnections whose clearances were denied). \n \n\n \n9 \n                                                                                                                                             \nThe Government produced substantial evidence of Applicant\u2019s contacts with his \nrelatives living in Nigeria and Sierra Leone, and his possible future travel to Nigeria \nbefore his father dies to raise the issue of potential foreign pressure or attempted \nexploitation. AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a), 7(b), and 7(d) apply and further inquiry is necessary.  \n \nAG \u00b6 8 lists six conditions that could mitigate foreign influence security concerns \nincluding: \n \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nU.S.; \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country \nis so minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding \nrelationships and loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected \nto resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest;  \n \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation; \n \n(d) the foreign contacts and activities are on U.S. Government business or \nare approved by the cognizant security authority; \n \n(e) the individual has promptly complied with existing agency \nrequirements regarding the reporting of contacts, requests, or threats from \npersons, groups, or organizations from a foreign country; and \n \n(f) the value or routine nature of the foreign business, financial, or property \ninterests is such that they are unlikely to result in a conflict and could not \nbe used effectively to influence, manipulate, or pressure the individual. \n  \n \n \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 8(a) and 8(c) partially apply. Because of his limited contact with his \nrelatives living in Nigeria and Sierra Leone, especially his lack of travel to Sierra Leone \nand his lack of travel to Nigeria since 1997, \u201cit is unlikely [he] will be placed in a position \nof having to choose between the interests of [his relatives in Nigeria and Sierra Leone] \nand the interests of the U.S.\u201d However, his contacts by telephone (once a month with \nhis father and monthly with his siblings and his wife calls her mother four times a year) \nare sufficiently frequent to raise the possibility of forcing him to choose between the \nUnited States and the welfare of his relatives living in Nigeria and Sierra Leone. He is \nnot able to fully meet his burden of showing there is \u201clittle likelihood that [his \nrelationships with his relatives in Nigeria and Sierra Leone] could create a risk for \nforeign influence or exploitation.\u201d   \n\n \n10 \n                                                                                                                                             \n \nAG \u00b6 8(b) fully applies. There is no evidence that his relatives living in Nigeria or \nSierra Leone are or have been political activist(s), challenging the policies of their \ngovernments. There is no evidence that his relatives living in Nigeria or Sierra Leone \ncurrently work or ever worked for the governments or military or any news media. There \nis no evidence that terrorists or the governments of Nigeria or Sierra Leone have \napproached or threatened Applicant or his relatives living in Nigeria or Sierra Leone for \nany reason. There is no evidence that his relatives living in Nigeria or Sierra Leone \ncurrently engage in activities which would bring attention to them or that hostile or \npotentially hostile elements in Nigeria or Sierra Leone are even aware of Applicant\u2019s \nwork. As such, there is a reduced possibility that his relatives living in Nigeria and/or \nSierra Leone or Applicant himself would be targets for coercion or exploitation. While \nthe government does not have any burden to prove the presence of such evidence, if \nsuch record evidence was present, Applicant would have a very heavy evidentiary \nburden to overcome to mitigate foreign influence security concerns.   \n \nA key factor in the AG \u00b6 8(b) analysis is Applicant\u2019s \u201cdeep and longstanding \nrelationships and loyalties in the U.S.\u201d He must establish that \u201c[he] can be expected to \nresolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest.\u201d Applicant is a U.S. citizen. \nHe received his post-secondary education in the United States. His three children are \nU.S. citizens, and all reside in the United States. His three children have never left the \nUnited States. His spouse is a permanent resident of the United States who intends to \nbecome a U.S. citizen. Applicant was born in Nigeria 49 years ago and moved to the \nUnited States in 1982, 26 years ago. He owns a home in the United States, has a 401K \nin the United States and a retirement plan with a former U.S. employer. He intends to \nretire in the United States. His connections to Sierra Leone and Nigeria are quite \nlimited. He has not visited Nigeria since his mother\u2019s funeral in 1997, and has never \nvisited Sierra Leone.  He does not own property in Nigeria or Sierra Leone.  His only \nconnections to these countries are relatives living in those countries who communicate \nwith him over the telephone about their family situations.  \n  \nAG \u00b6 8(f) partially applies because Applicant has no interest in property in Nigeria \nor Sierra Leone and he has significant U.S. property and assets. These mitigating \nconditions taken together are sufficient to fully overcome the foreign influence security \nconcerns.   \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n Under the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \n\n \n11 \n                                                                                                                                             \n                                           \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole person concept. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guideline B in my whole person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(a) were \naddressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional comment. \n \nA Guideline B decision concerning Nigeria and Sierra Leone must take into \nconsideration the geopolitical situation in those two countries, as well as the dangers \nexisting in Nigeria and Sierra Leone.3 While there is no evidence either of these two \ncountries are known collectors of U.S. intelligence and sensitive economic information, \nthey both have very serious economic, military, political, judicial/legal and social \nproblems.  \n \nApplicant has not traveled to Nigeria since his mother\u2019s funeral in 1997 and has \nnever traveled to Sierra Leone. His ties to his father, siblings, in-laws, and their children \nare limited to telephone calls for family news and payment of about $500 for his father\u2019s \nmedical needs. His communications establish ties of affection to his Nigerian family \nmembers. There is some possibility that Applicant could be placed in a position of \nhaving to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, group, organization, or \ngovernment and the interests of the United States, especially because Nigeria and \nSierra Leone have a significant lawless element, who may attempt to harm Applicant\u2019s \nrelatives to gain some kind of advantage over Applicant.  \n \nApplicant was born in Nigeria 49 years ago, and has lived in the United States \nsince 1982. He became a U.S. citizen in 1996. He attended a U.S. university and \ngraduate school for his education. His three children are U.S. citizens, and all reside in \nthe United States. He worked for a government contractor since 2007 as a security \nguard. An employee of his company and a command sergeant major lauded his \ndedication, good judgment and professionalism. He is active in his community and \ncoaches soccer for his children\u2019s team. Although the possibility of attempted exploitation \nof Applicant is relatively low, Applicant\u2019s strong connections to the United States and \nespecially to his children establish \u201csuch deep and longstanding relationships and \nloyalties in the U.S., [he] can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of \nthe U.S. interest.\u201d   \n \nIn a 2006 decision, the Appeal Board held the Judge properly determined under \nthe \u201cwhole person\u201d concept that an applicant with very significant connections to Russia \nhad mitigated security concerns under Guideline B.  In ISCR Case No. 03-04300, 2006 \n \n3 See ISCR Case No. 04-02630 at 3 (App. Bd. May 23, 2007) (remanding because of insufficient \ndiscussion of geopolitical situation and suggesting expansion of whole person discussion). \n  \n\n \n12 \n                                                                                                                                             \n                                           \nDOHA Lexis 264 at *17-*21 (App. Bd. Feb. 16, 2006),4 the applicant had weekly contact \nwith her mother (who lives in Russia), contact three times per year with her aunt (who \nlives in Russia); contact about four times per year with her father-in-law (who lives in \nRussia); and multiple annual contacts with other relatives living in Israel. She had visited \nher family in Russia and Israel, on more than one occasion, after immigrating to the \nUnited States. Moreover, she owned a half interest in her mother\u2019s apartment in Russia, \nand provided financial support to her mother and aunt. The Judge\u2019s whole person \nanalysis (that the Appeal Board determined was sufficient to mitigate such significant \nforeign influence security concerns) provides: \n     \nLooking at all of [whole person] factors, I conclude Applicant has \novercome foreign influence security concerns. Given her strong ties to the \nU.S. and her limited contact with Russia and Israel since she became a \nU.S. naturalized citizen, there is limited potential for coercion, exploitation \nor duress. (E.2.2.1.8. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress.)  All of her immediate family are in the U.S., and the majority of \nher financial ties are in the U.S. Applicant has been a naturalized U.S. \ncitizen for over fifteen years. She returned to Russia in April 2005 to \nabjure her Russian citizenship and has had limited visits with her mother, \naunt and father-in-law in 1995 and 2002. She provides minimal support to \nher mother and aunt. She has only visited her sister and family in Israel in \n1991, 1994, and 1997. While she has contact with her relatives in Russia \nand her relatives in Israel, that contact is limited.  While her niece serves \nin the Israeli military, she has limited contact with her.  Clearly, she put her \ninterests in the U.S. ahead of her loyalty to her elderly mother when she \nchose to renounce her Russian citizenship. \n \nGiven her long history with her employer since April 2000, it is unlikely that \nshe could be exploited by coercive or non-coercive means by the \ngovernment in Russia or in Israel in a way that could force Applicant to \nchoose between loyalty to her mother, aunt, father-in-law, her sibling and \nfamily and her loyalty to the United States. She stated that should any \nsuch attempt be made she would immediately contact the appropriate \nU.S. authorities. Thus, any risk of either coercive or non-coercive foreign \nduress or influence on Applicant and/or her immediate family would \nappear to be slight and clearly manageable. Contacts with citizens of other \ncountries are relevant to security determinations only if they make an \nindividual potentially vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or pressure \nthrough threats against those foreign relatives. \n \n \nWhile clearance decisions are inherently based on numerous facts, and as such \nare made as a result of a fact-by-fact, case-by-case analysis, it is clear that the Russian \napplicant in ISCR Case No. 03-04300 had more significant connections to Russia than \nthe Applicant does in this case with Nigeria or Sierra Leone. Clearly, the applicant\u2019s \n \n4The Appeal Board reversed the Judge\u2019s decision to grant a clearance because of the strict \nrequirements of the Money Memorandum (Applicant in ISCR Case No. 03-04300 had not turned in her \nRussian passport to the Russian government by the close of evidence).   \n\n \n13 \n                                                                                                                                             \n                                           \nconnections to the United States in ISCR Case No. 03-04300 are less than this \nApplicant\u2019s U.S. connections. Here, this Applicant has lived in the United States longer \n(since 1982) and his children are solely U.S. citizens.5  \n \nAfter weighing the evidence of his connections to Nigeria and Sierra Leone and \nto the United States, and all the facts in this decision, I conclude Applicant has carried \nhis burden of mitigating the foreign influence security concerns. \n \nI take this position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518 (1988), my \u201ccareful consideration of the whole person factors\u201d6 and \nsupporting evidence, my application of the pertinent factors under the Adjudicative \nProcess, all the evidence in this decision, and my interpretation of my responsibilities \nunder the Guidelines. For the reasons stated, I conclude he is eligible for access to \nclassified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:    \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a and 1.b: \n For Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

Goldstein, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Binh T. Bui, Esquire\nJanuary 12, 2008\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nMOGUL, Martin H., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted his Security Clearance Application (SF 86), on May 1, 2007.\nOn August 13, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under Guidelines C and B\nfor Applicant. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative\nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective\nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant replied to the SOR (RSOR) in writing on August 29, 2008, and\nrequested a hearing before an Administrative Judge. I received the case assignment on\nOctober 6, 20087. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on October 9, 2008, and I\nconvened the hearing as scheduled on November 6, 2008, in San Diego, California. The\nGovernment offered Exhibits 1 through 5, which were received without objection.\nApplicant testified on his own behalf and had one additional witness testify. Through\ncounsel, he also submitted Exhibits A through F. Exhibit E was objected to as being\n\n2\npartially written in a language other than English. The record was kept open to allow\nApplicant to submit a translated copy of Exhibit E, but no document was received.\nTherefore, Exhibits A through D and Exhibit F have been admitted into evidence, but\nExhibit E is not admitted, and I have not considered this exhibit in this decision. DOHA\nreceived the transcript of the hearing (Tr) on November 14, 2008. Based upon a review\nof the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified\ninformation is granted.\nRequest for Administrative Notice\nDepartment Counsel submitted a formal request that I take administrative notice\nof certain facts relating to the Palestinian Territories. The request and the attached\ndocuments were admitted into evidence as Exhibit 5. The facts that have been\nadministratively noticed are set out in the Findings of Fact, below. \nFindings of Fact\nAfter a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, including\nApplicant's RSOR, the admitted documents, and the testimony of Applicant and the\nother witness, and upon due consideration of that evidence, I make the following\nfindings of fact: \nApplicant is 27 years old and was born in Kuwait in1981.  He has been a United\nStates citizen from birth since his father was a U.S. citizen. His mother was born in\nBethlehem, but Applicant does not believe that she is a citizen of Palestine, nor is he\naware of any other country of which she is a citizen.  At 9 years of age he moved with\nhis family to Bethlehem, where he stayed for eight years. He moved to the United\nStates when he was 17 years of age in 1998, to pursue his studies.  Applicant received\na Bachelor of Science degree in 2006, from a United States university.\nApplicant is employed by a defense contractor, and he seeks a DoD security\nclearance in connection with his employment in the defense sector.\nParagraph 1 (Guideline C - Foreign Preference) \n1.a. It is alleged in the SOR that Applicant exercised dual citizenship with\nPalestine and the United States. Applicant contends that he has not engaged in any of\nthe responsibilities or duties of being a citizen of Palestine, nor does he consider himself\nto be  a dual citizen of Palestine and the United States. Rather he only consider himself\na U.S. citizen, since when he was born his father was a U.S. citizen and he was not\naware of any citizenship status of his mother. He did not believe that his mother was a\ncitizen of Palestine. He testified that he never applied to become a Palestinian citizen.\nApplicant did however, apply for and receive a passport from the Palestinian\nauthority, even though he was a United States citizen, which is alleged in the SOR as\n1.b., and which will be reviewed below. This appears to be the only example of\nApplicant exercising citizenship from a country other the U.S. \n\n3\n1.b. It is alleged in the SOR that Applicant applied for and was issued a\nPalestinian passport, on October 28, 2005, even though he had become a United\nStates citizen on May 18, 2001.  The record is clear that when Applicant was born, his\nfather was a United States citizen, so Applicant was born a U.S. citizen.  \nApplicant testified that in 2005, he entered Israel to visit his mother in Bethlehem,\nwith his U.S. passport, and he had planned to exit with the same passport.  He stated\nthat he was informed by a representative of the Israeli government that he would need\nto obtain a Palestinian passport for him to exit Israeil.  Applicant testified that the only\nreason that he applied for this passport was to exit Israel. He only used it on that one\noccasion in 2005 when he left Israel. \n1.c. It is alleged in the SOR that Applicant used his Palestinian passport on\nOctober 2005, to enter and exit Israel, instead of his U.S. passport. Applicant testified\nthat he did not use his Palestinian passport to enter Israel, but only to exit it, as he was\ninformed it was required. \n1.d. It is alleged in the SOR that Applicant continues to maintain his active\nPalestinian passport because he expects to inherit family property in Palestine.\nApplicant testified that his Palestinian passport has expired, and it is now being held by\nthe facility security officer of his employer. Exhibit C is a copy of that passport, which\nshows that it expired on October 27, 2008.\nApplicant stated that while he might inherit part of a piece of property that had\nbeen held by his grandfather, since he would be one of many who would potentially\nshare the inheritance, he did not expect its value to exceed $1,000. \nI can not find that Applicant\u2019s application and receipt of his Palestinian  passport,\nin the way described above, indicated a preference for another county over the United\nSates or exhibited the exercise of dual citizenship with Palestine and the U.S.\nFinally, while Applicant testified that he does not consider himself a citizen of\nPalestine,  he did testify that he would be willing to renounce his Palestinian citizenship,\nif it was established that he was a citizen of Palestine.\nWhen he was questioned as to what he would do if a representative of a terrorist\ngroup in Palestine threatened his family in Palestine if he did not cooperate with them,\nhe testified, \u201cI would consult with the U.S. Government in the first place and see what\nthey have \u2013 I wouldn\u2019t react on my own.\u201d (Tr at 83-84). \nParagraph 2 (Guideline B - Foreign Influence) \n2.a. It is alleged in the SOR that Applicant's mother is a dual citizen of Palestine\nand the U.S., and resides in the United States. Applicant confirmed that his mother, who\nis 53 years old, resides in the United States, and she has been a legal resident of the\nU.S. since 2006. He testified that she was born in Bethlehem at the time it was part of\n\n4\nJordan, so it is not clear what her present country of citizenship is.  However, she does\nplan to become a U.S. citizens when she  meets the eligibility requirements.\n \n2.b.  It is alleged in the SOR that Applicant's sister is a dual citizen of Kuwait and\nthe U.S., and resides in the United States. Applicant testified that his sister and brother\nwere born in Kuwait, but are not Kuwaiti citizens, only citizens of the U.S. They both\nreside with him and his mother in the U.S., and all three of them are full time students in\nthe U.S.\nApplicant\u2019s mother has three brothers, and there are three brothers of his\ndeceased father, all of  whom are U.S. Citizens, residing in the U.S. \n2.c. Applicant traveled to Palestine in October 2005, to visit his relatives,\nprimarily his mother. As discussed above, all of his closest family now reside in the U.S.\nOne witness testified on behalf of Applicant. She extolled his virtues including his\nhonesty and innocence.\nHistory and Current Status of Palestine\nI take administrative notice of the following facts regarding Palestine.  Palestine\nis a territory , created following World War I, as a result of a British mandate. The\nterritory included land that is within the current borders of Israel, Jordan, the West Bank\nand the Gaza strip. In 1948, the British withdrew from the Palestinian Territory and Jews\nproclaimed an independent State of Israel. Arabs living in the Palestinian territory\nmoved to the Egyptian controlled Gaza Strip, the Jordanian ruled West Bank, Jordan,\nSyria, and Lebanon. \nIn January 2006 Palestinian legislative election, an opposition party, Hamas,\nformed a government without Fatah, the former ruling party within Palestine as part of\nthe Palestinian Liberation Organization (PLO). The United States has designated\nHamas and six other Palestinian groups as Foreign Terrorist Organizations. \nIn February 2007, Hamas and Fatah signed an agreement to form a national\nunity government. However, in June 2007, factional fighting broke out and Hamas took\ncomplete control of the Gaza strip. Fatah retained control over the West Bank. \nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\n\n5\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline C, Foreign Preference\nUnder AG \u00b6 9 the security concern involving foreign preference arises, \u201c[W]hen\nan individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a foreign country over\nthe United States, then he or she may be prone to provide information or make\ndecisions that are harmful to the interests of the United States.\u201d\n\n6\nApplicant\u2019s application and receipt of an Palestinian passport raises foreign\npreference concerns under Disqualifying Condition DC 10 (a), the exercise of the\nprivilege of foreign citizenship.\nHowever, Applicant only applied for the foreign passport when he was told it was\nnecessary to exit Israel. He has never used it since that time, and it has now expired\nand it is in the possession of his facility security officer.  Additionally, while he does not\nconsider himself to be a citizen of Palestine, he indicated that he would renounce his\nPalestinian citizenship to the proper authorities, if it was shown that he was a citizen of\nPalestine. Therefore, I find that Mitigating Conditions (MC) (b) and (e) under this\nguideline apply to this case. After considering all of the evidence of record on Guideline\nC, I conclude that the mitigating evidence substantially outweighs the disqualifying\nevidence. \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence\nAG \u00b6 6 expresses the security concern regarding foreign influence:\nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual\nhas divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or\ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a\nway that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by\nany foreign interest. Adjudication under this Guideline can and should\nconsider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or\nfinancial interest is located, including, but not limited to, such\nconsiderations as whether the foreign country is known to target United\nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a\nrisk of terrorism.\nAG \u00b6 7 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be\ndisqualifying (DC). Those that could be applicable in this case include the following: (a)\ncontact with a foreign family member, business or professional associate, friend, or\nother person who is a citizen of or resident in a foreign country if that contact creates a\nheightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion;\nApplicant\u2019s mother, whose citizenship is not clear,  and sister, who appears to be a dual\ncitizen of Kuwait and the U. S., although they both now reside in the U.S. with plans to\nremain here may make DC (a) of concern to the Government.\nAG \u00b6 8 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns (MC):\n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual's sense of loyalty\nor obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country is so minimal, or the\nindividual has such deep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in the U.S., that\nthe individual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S.\ninterest. \n\n7\nI find that MC (b) is applicable to this Applicant and strongly controlling for the\nfollowing reasons: Applicant, who is 27 years old, immigrated to the United States when\nhe was 17 and has lived here since then. He was born a  U.S. citizen, since his father\nwas a U.S. citizen.  He received a college degrees in the U.S. While he did not consider\nhimself a dual citizen of Palestine, since he did not believe that his mother was a\nPalestinian citizen, he did indicate a willingness to renounce any citizenship of\nPalestine. He only applied for a Palestinian passport, because he was informed that it\nwas required for him to exit Israel, and he has never used it again. The Palestinian\npassport has now expired. Finally, all of his close family members now reside in the\nUnited States. I therefore, conclude Guideline B for Applicant.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation\nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent\nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d\nUnder AG \u00b6 2 (c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.      \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Based on all of the reasons cited\nabove as to why MC (b) and (e) apply under Guideline C and MC (b) applies under\nGuideline B, I  find that the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance under the whole person\nconcept. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant mitigated the security concerns. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline C:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a. through 1.d.:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline B:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a. through 2.c.:\n For Applicant\n\n8\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.\n                                              \nMartin H. Mogul\nAdministrative Judge\n",

He honestly admitted this use during the security\nclearance investigation, and there was no other evidence of it. His life circumstances\nhave changed, and he persuasively established his intent not to abuse any drugs in the\nfuture. Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony,\neligibility for access to classified information is granted. \nApplicant submitted his Electronic Questionnaires for Investigation Processing\n(e-QIP), on May 21, 2007. On July 16, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and\nAppeals (DOHA) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security\nconcerns under Guidelines H, and E. The action was taken under Executive Order\n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as\namended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel\nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the\nrevised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29,\n2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September\n1, 2006. \nJanuary 29, 2009\n\n2\nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on July 18, 2008.

Department Counsel was prepared to proceed on August 28, 2008, and the case\nwas assigned to me on September 3, 2008. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on\nSeptember 3, 2008, and I convened the hearing as scheduled on September 26, 2008.\nThe Government offered exhibits (GE) 1 and 2, which were admitted without objection.\nThe Government also offered HE II, comprising the Under Secretary of Defense\n(Intelligence) Memorandum, dated June 20, 2008, and three sections of the United\nStates Code, to support a request that I take administrative notice of the facts that the\nBond Amendment prohibits granting a security clearance to an unlawful user of a\ncontrolled substance or a drug addict, and that marijuana is a controlled substance.\nApplicant had no objection, and administrative notice was taken of these facts together\nwith pertinent definitions of those terms. Applicant testified on his own behalf, and\nsubmitted exhibits (AE) A1 through A12, which were admitted without objection.\nApplicant\u2019s wife, supervisor, and several law enforcement and security personnel with\nwhom he has worked also testified for him.

(GE 1 at 1-3, 7-9, 15-17, 21; Tr. at 98, 103-107, 116.)\nOn his e-QIP, Applicant admitted to using marijuana on an occasional,\nrecreational basis from January 2004 to present. (GE 1 at \u00a7 24.) He later described his\nuse as about once per month, on average, with his wife or close friends. (GE 2 at 3.) His\n\n3\nwife confirmed that he only smoked marijuana once every month or two, in social\nsettings with her and friends. (Tr. at 90.) He never used marijuana while he was in the\nNational Guard, and never tested positive or was arrested for any drug use. (Tr. at 96-\n97.) His use was casual enough that he does not remember exactly when it started and\nstopped, but knows it was not before January 2004 or after February 2008, when he\nand his wife made a firm commitment that neither would use marijuana again because\nthey found out she was pregnant. He had also committed to stopping when required to\ndo so by the security clearance process, but had believed his wife might continue use\nuntil her pregnancy. Both Applicant and his wife testified very firmly and credibly that\nthey decided to stop using marijuana altogether in February 2008, had no problem\ndoing so, and were not going to use it, or any other illegal drug, in the future. (GE 2 at 3;\nTr. at 80-91, 98-100, 110-115.)\nApplicant submitted two urine samples, collected August 19, and September 6,\n2008, for private testing at a laboratory. Both samples tested negative for all seven\ndrugs screened. (AE A2; AE A3.) Applicant\u2019s wife, and four supervisors who have\nknown him for years, all testified that he is completely honest and very firm in following\nthrough on his commitments. His four supervisors hold senior and highly responsible\npositions in organizational security and information protection. All hold high-level\nsecurity clearances, and expressed their complete trust and confidence in Applicant\u2019s\nability to protect sensitive information, and to abstain from any drug abuse in the future.\nAll of their testimony in this regard was highly credible and compelling. (Tr. at 47-91.)\nApplicant also submitted his most recent outstanding annual performance review and\nfour letters of appreciation spanning 2003 to 2008 for excellent performance of\nimportant work, for much of which he is uniquely qualified. (AE A7 through A11.)\nApplicant has ended all contact with former drug-involved associates, except his\nwife and one friend who has not used marijuana for a long time. (Tr. at 101-102.) He\nand his wife are dedicated to providing a good example for their child, and find any drug\nuse incompatible with parenting. Applicant testified openly and honestly about his past\ndrug abuse, and convincingly declared his intent never to abuse drugs in the future. He\nknew that he would have to stop while holding a clearance, and always intended to do\nso. He honestly did not know, and no one ever told him, that occasional use while his\napplication was pending could be disqualifying, but was told by his security manager to\nbe fully honest about all such matters. (Tr. at 73-75, 97-98.) He also submitted a signed,\nsworn statement of intent never to use marijuana or other controlled substances in the\nfuture, with automatic revocation of his clearance resulting from any such use. (AE A1.)\nHe understands and agrees that, if granted a clearance, his terms of employment will\nrequire him to undergo random drug testing. (AR at 4.)  \nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\n\n4\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\u00b6\n2(a) and 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in\nthe context of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The\nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person,\npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to classified\ninformation will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I\nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the\nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is\nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or\nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the\nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d Section 7\nof Executive Order 10865 provides that \u201cAny determination under this order adverse to\nan applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no\nsense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d \nA person applying for access to classified information seeks to enter into a\nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\nAnalysis\nGuideline H, Drug Involvement\nAG \u00b6 24 expresses the security concern pertaining to drug involvement: \u201cUse of\nan illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise questions about an individual's\nreliability and trustworthiness, both because it may impair judgment and because it\nraises questions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and\n\n5\nregulations.\u201d AG \u00b6 25 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may\nbe disqualifying. Disqualifying conditions raised by the SOR allegations and asserted by\nDepartment Counsel are: \u201c(a) any drug abuse;\u201d \u201c(c) illegal drug possession, including\ncultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of\ndrug paraphernalia;\u201d and \u201c(h) expressed intent to continue illegal drug use, or failure to\nclearly and convincingly commit to discontinue drug use.\u201d (Tr. at 119.) SOR \u00b6 1.f also\nalleges that his use of marijuana disqualifies Applicant from being granted a clearance\nunder the Bond Amendment.  \nApplicant admitted to recreational use of marijuana about once a month over\nabout a four-year period between January 2004 and February 2008. He then stopped\nusing it, both because it is incompatible with holding a security clearance and because\nhe and his wife committed to stop after learning she was pregnant (AG \u00b6 25(a)). They\npurchased the marijuana they used, but never grew or distributed any (AG \u00b6 25(c)).\nApplicant never expressed an intent to continue illegal drug use, although he did tell an\ninvestigator he thought his wife might do so and said he could stop if his clearance so\nrequired. At that July 2007 interview, those statements would reasonably support\nsecurity concerns under AG \u00b6 25(h).   \nAG \u00b6 26 provides conditions that an applicant could establish in order to mitigate\nsecurity concerns. Mitigating conditions raised by this record include: \u201c(a) the behavior\nhappened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened under such circumstances that\nit is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability,\ntrustworthiness, or good judgment;\u201d and \u201c(b) a demonstrated intent not to abuse any\ndrugs in the future, such as: (1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts;\n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; (3) an appropriate\nperiod of abstinence; and, (4) a signed statement of intent with automatic revocation of\nclearance for any violation.\u201d\nApplicant\u2019s drug possession and use occurred over about four years, and as\nrecently as February 2008. This conduct was relatively recent and not particularly\ninfrequent. However, it did happen under circumstances that have significantly changed.\nFirst, Applicant and his wife became parents and convincingly testified that they believe\nmarijuana use to be incompatible with their new lives and raising their child. Second,\nApplicant now understands that what he formerly considered casual and socially\nacceptable marijuana use is incompatible with obtaining a security clearance. He clearly\nvalues the ability to perform the important work for which his supervisors support his\nclearance far more than he values any future drug use. Applicant met his burden of\nestablishing that his drug possession and use occurred under circumstances that it is\nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness or\ngood judgment (AG \u00b6 26(a)). He did not do so while in the military and will not do so\nwhile a parent or while holding a clearance. Applicant provided substantial evidence of\nhis intent not to abuse drugs in the future, including his disassociation from drug-using\ncontacts, his abstinence for almost a year and two negative urinalysis tests, and his\nsigned statement of intent with automatic revocation (\u00b6 26(b)). This case did not involve\n\n6\nabuse of prescription drugs, nor was any drug treatment program prescribed, so neither\nAG \u00b6\u00b6 26 (c) nor (d) apply.\nConcerning the Bond Amendment, that provision of law prohibits all Federal\nAgencies from granting or renewing a security clearance to any person who is an\nunlawful user of a controlled substance or is an addict. There is neither an allegation nor\nany evidence indicating that Applicant is addicted to anything. The Under Secretary of\nDefense (Intelligence) defined an \u201cunlawful user\u201d for Bond Amendment implementation\npurposes in his June 20, 2008 memorandum (HE II), as follows:\nan \u201cunlawful user of a controlled substance\u201d is a person who uses a\ncontrolled substance and has lost the power of self-control with reference\nto the use of the controlled substance, and any person who is a current\nuser of the controlled substance in a manner other than as prescribed by a\nlicensed physician. Such use is not limited to the use of drugs on a\nparticular day, or within a matter of days or weeks before, but rather that\nthe unlawful use has occurred recently enough to indicate that the\nindividual is actively engaged in such conduct. \nUp until February 2008, Applicant met the definition of an unlawful user of marijuana.\nAfter that time, he has convincingly stopped being an unlawful user of marijuana and is\nmost unlikely to ever do so again. He never lost self-control with reference to his use of\nmarijuana. Accordingly, Applicant has met his burden of showing he is no longer\ndisqualified from eligibility for a clearance under the Bond Amendment.  \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct\nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern pertaining to personal conduct:\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful\nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other\nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\nAG \u00b6 16 sets forth potentially disqualifying conditions. The SOR alleged\nApplicant\u2019s use of marijuana after having submitted his security clearance application as\nthe conduct giving rise to Guideline E concerns. Department Counsel argued that this\nallegation raised AG \u00b6 16(d)(3):\n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any\nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse\ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information\nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment,\nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply\n\n7\nwith rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the\nperson may not properly safeguard protected information. This includes\nbut is not limited to consideration of:\n(1) untrustworthy or unreliable behavior to include breach of client\nconfidentiality, release of proprietary information, unauthorized\nrelease of sensitive corporate or other government protected\ninformation:\n(2) disruptive, violent, or other inappropriate behavior in the\nworkplace; \n(3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations; and,\n(4) evidence of significant misuse of Government or other\nemployer's time or resources.\nWhile smoking marijuana at any time is covered under Guideline H, the particular\nissues of judgment and willingness to abide by rules and regulations that potentially\narise from doing so while a clearance application is pending are not covered there. The\nGuideline H aggravated disqualifying condition only pertains to drug use after being\ngranted a clearance (AG \u00b6 25(g)). Applicant has not been dishonest in the least. In fact,\nhis candid admissions are the only evidence raising any concerns in the first place. His\noccasional, casual marijuana use was technically illegal but not otherwise of special\nconcern within his then-existing social circle. He expressed his willingness and ability to\nstop doing so when required by his clearance status, and was never told it was of\nimmediate concern while his application was pending. Had he been so told, he would\nhave stopped earlier than he voluntarily did in February 2008. All who know him well\ntestified that, other than this self-admitted and now-regretted series of bad decisions, he\nis a stickler for rules, has excellent judgment, and is highly dependable. \nThis personal conduct analysis, by terms of the guideline, overlaps with and\nimplicates the following whole person analysis as well. For the same reasons discussed\nabove under Guideline H, security concerns arising from this conduct are substantially\nmitigated under AG \u00b6 17(c) (\u201cthe offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or\nthe behavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is\nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness,\nor good judgment\u201d). Because all his supervisors and family already know about this past\ndrug use, he also established mitigation under AG \u00b6 17(e) (\u201cthe individual has taken\npositive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or\nduress\u201d). \nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s\n\n8\nconduct and all the circumstances established by the record evidence. The\nadministrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6\n2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.    \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant\u2019s conduct of security\nconcern involved a four-year period of occasional marijuana use. He was never arrested\nfor this, never distributed any drugs, never tested positive for use or showed any\nimpairment or other effects at work, where he excelled. This occurred when he was\nmature and fully responsible for his choices, but in a social situation where it was\nconsidered acceptable behavior. He and his wife both decided to stop smoking\nmarijuana for good in February 2008, and have not done so since. This behavioral\nchange appears to be permanent and drug use is most unlikely to recur. Applicant\u2019s\nmotivation for the conduct was social enjoyment, but that interest is now heavily\noutweighed by his desire to be a good parent and to be worthy of a security clearance\nto do pending, important work. I have seldom seen a more impressive, serious, and\nconvincing group of character witnesses testify as credibly about their confidence in his\nintegrity and determination to refrain from any future drug use or other irresponsible\nbehavior. \nApplicant\u2019s use of marijuana was casual and occurred during a relatively brief\nperiod of his life comprising the early years of his relationship with his second wife. She\nclearly influenced his choice to do this, and has now joined him in his commitment to\npermanently change that aspect of their lives. His supervisors at work were somewhat\nsurprised to learn he had used marijuana, but were neither surprised by his honesty\nabout it when asked, nor the least bit doubtful of his determination and ability to stop.\nThere is no susceptibility to coercion or duress arising from this past conduct, since it is\nknown to all whose knowledge of it could be detrimental to Applicant. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with no doubt as to Applicant\u2019s present\neligibility and suitability for a security clearance. He has fully met his burden to mitigate\nthe security concerns arising from drug involvement and personal conduct\nconsiderations.\n\n9\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline H:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline E:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a\nsecurity clearance.

Marine, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Jeffrey A. Denner, Esquire\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nMATCHINSKI, Elizabeth M., Administrative Judge:\nAlcohol consumption concerns raised by Applicant\u2019s drunk driving offenses in\nMay 2003 and March 2006, and by his July 2006 open container violation are not\nmitigated. He continues to minimize his drinking history to where it cannot be concluded\nthat issues of alcohol abuse are safely in the past. Clearance is denied.\nStatement of the Case\nApplicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-\nQIP) on November 20, 2006. On December 16, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings\nand Appeals (DOHA) issued to Applicant a statement of reasons (SOR) detailing the\nsecurity concerns under Guideline G, alcohol consumption, that provided the basis for\nits preliminary decision to deny him a security clearance and refer the matter to an\nadministrative judge. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative\nguidelines (AG) effective within the Department of Defense as of September 1, 2006.\nFebruary 3, 2010\n\n2\nOn April 3, 2009, Applicant answered the SOR and he requested a hearing if his\nresponse did not lead to a favorable resolution. The case was assigned to me on May\n15, 2009, to decide whether it is clearly consistent to grant or continue a security\nclearance for Applicant. Scheduling the hearing was delayed on Applicant\u2019s\nrepresentation that he planned to retain legal counsel. Having received no entry of\nappearance from his attorney by August 11, 2009, I issued a notice of hearing to\nApplicant scheduling his hearing for September 2, 2009.\nOn August 20, 2009, counsel for Applicant entered his appearance and moved\nfor a continuance, citing his unavailability on September 2, 2009, due to prior\ncommitments, and needing time to prepare because he had just been retained. The\ngovernment objected, citing Applicant\u2019s failure to exercise due diligence in seeking\ncounsel. While Applicant was shown to have failed to retain counsel in a timely manner,\nI granted a brief continuance due to his legal counsel\u2019s unavailability on September 2,\n2009. On September 1, 2009, I rescheduled the hearing for October 28, 2009.\nI convened the hearing on October 28, 2009, as rescheduled. The government\nsubmitted 11 exhibits (Ex. 1-11), which were admitted without any objections. Applicant\nand three witnesses testified on his behalf, as reflected in a transcript (Tr.) received on\nNovember 9, 2009.\nFindings of Fact\nDOHA alleged under Guideline G, alcohol consumption, that Applicant was cited\nin July 2006 for transporting alcohol, for which he was required to undergo an alcohol\nassessment, and for operating a vehicle without a valid license, for which he was fined\n(SOR 1.a); that he was charged in March 2006 with driving under the influence (DUI)\nbut convicted of a lesser charge of \u201cwet reckless\u201d for which he paid fines and costs of\n$1,800, was placed on three years probation, and ordered to complete an alcohol\neducation program (SOR 1.b); and that he had been convicted previously of a May\n2003 operating a vehicle under the influence (OUI) offense (SOR 1.c). Applicant denied\nhe was convicted of the 2003 OUI but he admitted the other offenses. After considering\nthe pleadings, transcript, and exhibits, I make the following findings of fact.\nApplicant is a 33-year-old electrical engineer, who has worked for his present\ndefense contractor employer since about October 2008 (Tr. 32). He was granted a\nsecret clearance in October 2003 for his work with a previous employer, which included\nclassified work and access to special programs (Ex. 3, Tr. 28-29).\nApplicant began drinking alcohol in 1996 or 1997, when he was a 19-year-old\ncollege student. He consumed alcohol on weekends, and at parties (Ex. 2, Tr. 39).\nApplicant worked full-time while pursuing his undergraduate degree at night, initially in\nthe stock room, then in assembly, and eventually as a network administrator with a local\ntechnology company (Ex. 2, Tr. 22, 25). Before his final semester, he started working for\na defense contractor in June 1999, and he was granted a secret-level security\nclearance. In January 2000, he was awarded his bachelor of science degree in\nelectrical engineering (Ex. 1). \n\nApplicant told the arresting officer that he had consumed \u201ctwo beers\u201d at an establishment named\n1\n\u201cMargaritas\u201d (Ex. 9). W hen he completed his e-QIP in November 2006, Applicant stated that he consumed\n\u201cthree drinks\u201d while out to a restaurant named \u201cMargaritas\u201d with his then girlfriend (Ex. 1). The government\ninvestigator who interviewed him in May 2007 reported that Applicant had consumed two \u201cMargarita\u201d mixed\ndrinks when out at a restaurant with his girlfriend and some coworkers (Ex. 2). At his hearing, Applicant\ntestified that he went to \u201cMargaritas\u201d next door to his work with some coworkers for dinner and he consumed\ntwo drinks (Tr. 36). W hether he consumed Margarita drinks or different mixed drinks, his testimony (two drinks)\nvaries from his e-QIP representations of having consumed three drinks.\nThe officer who arrested Applicant in May 2003 reported that Applicant was operating at \u201can\n2\nextremely high rate of speed\u201d (Ex. 9).\nThere are discrepancies in the record concerning the quantity of alcohol Applicant consumed before\n3\nthis arrest as well. Applicant told the police when he was stopped that he had consumed two beers (Ex. 4).\nApplicant indicated on his e-QIP completed in November 2006 that he drank two beers at the mountain, and\n3\nApplicant continued working for the same company, where he applied for a\nsecurity clearance. However, he left the job in the fall of 2000 before a final decision on\nhis clearance eligibility, for a new job in state X with a start-up company (Tr. 27).\nApplicant worked there until mid-November 2001, when the commute became too much\nfor him (Tr. 27). Excepting a two-week span in May 2002, Applicant was unemployed\nuntil August 2002, when he commenced employment as an engineer with a defense\ncontractor in adjacent state Y (Ex. 1, Tr. 28).\nWhile working for the defense contractor, Applicant\u2019s alcohol consumption\naveraged one or two drinks, sometimes three drinks, at the end of the day or with dinner\n(Ex. 2). In May 2003, Applicant consumed at least two mixed drinks while out with a\ngirlfriend and coworkers at a restaurant.  He and his now former girlfriend were en route\n1\nhome in her vehicle when he was stopped for speeding.  The officer detected signs of\n2\nalcohol on Applicant, and Applicant told the officer that he had consumed \u201c\u2018a couple of\nbeers.\u2019\u201d After he failed field sobriety tests, Applicant was arrested for OUI-alcohol or\ndrugs. He submitted to two breathalyzers at the station, which registered .10% and\n.12% blood alcohol levels. Applicant was charged with OUI, speeding, and marked\nlanes violation (Ex. 1, 2, 9, 11). While those charges were pending, Applicant was cited\nin late May 2003 for operating a vehicle with his license suspended, for no inspection\nsticker, and for failing to wear his seatbelt (Ex. 9). He appeared in court on all the\ncharges in September 2003, pleading guilty to, or admitting sufficient facts for the OUI\nand operating while license suspended charges, which were continued without a guilty\nfinding for one year. He was ordered for the OUI to complete a 24-day alcohol and drug\neducation program, to pay a $250 surfine, and he lost his operator\u2019s license for 45 days\n(Exs. 1, 2, 10). The remaining charges were filed (Ex. 10). Applicant attended an\nalcohol education program as mandated by the court. The program consisted of a class\nonce weekly where he watched movies (Tr. 63). On October 9, 2003, Applicant was\ngranted a secret-level clearance for his duties with the defense contractor (Ex. 3).\nIn March 2006, while on temporary duty for his employer for over a month of\nflight testing in a distant state (state Z) (Tr. 40), Applicant went skiing with a coworker on\nthe weekend. After skiing but before leaving the mountain, Applicant consumed at least\ntwo alcoholic beverages.  His coworker, who felt incapable of driving, asked Applicant to\n3\n\na third beer as he headed back on the road after stopping for gasoline. Yet, he also stated that he was pulled\nover shortly after opening the container (Ex. 1). W hen detailing the incident to the government investigator\nin May 2007, Applicant reportedly indicated that he had consumed \u201c2 Long Island Iced Tea mixed drinks\u201d\nbefore his arrest (Ex. 2). In June 2008, Applicant affirmed that the investigator\u2019s report was accurate. At his\nhearing, Applicant testified that he had \u201ctwo drinks\u201d (Tr. 60). Given his reckless driving and obvious signs of\nimpairment (red and watery eyes, slurred speech, failed field sobriety tests, blood alcohol content over the\nlegal limit about 1.5 hours after his arrest), it is simply not credible that he drank only two beers.\nApplicant told the responding officer that he had consumed two beers (Ex.4). On his e-QIP, Applicant\n4\nindicated, in part, \u201cW e headed back on the road in the desert and I drank my 3  beer. Shortly after opening\nrd\nthe container I was pulled over\u201d (Ex. 1). His appearance when he was stopped, his inability to pass the field\nsobriety test, and the results of the chemical test would tend to indicate that he drank at least one of the beers\npurchased by his companion, or he had consumed more alcohol before he started driving.\nApplicant has consistently referred to the charge as \u201cwet reckless.\u201d Applicant denies he was legally\n5\nimpaired by alcohol, although he does not dispute the chemical test result (Tr. 43).\nSection 23152(a) of state Z\u2019s vehicle code makes it unlawful for any person under the influence of\n6\nany alcoholic beverage or drug, or under the combined influence of any alcoholic beverage or drug, to drive\na vehicle. Section 23152(b) specifically states that it is unlawful for any person who has 0.08 percent or more,\nby weight, of alcohol in his or her blood, to drive a vehicle. Section 23103(a) provides that a person is guilty\nof reckless driving if he or she drives a vehicle upon a highway in willful or wanton disregard for the safety of\npersons or property. Under Section 23103.5, when the prosecution agrees to a plea of guilty or nolo\ncontendere to a violation of Section 23103 (reckless driving) in satisfaction of, or as a substitute for, an original\ncharge of driving under the influence in violation in Section 23152, the prosecution shall state for the record\na factual basis for the satisfaction or substitution, including whether any consumption of alcohol or\nadministration of any drug was involved. \n4\noperate the vehicle the coworker had rented. Applicant did not feel intoxicated so he\nagreed. They stopped for gasoline en route to their hotel, and Applicant\u2019s companion\nbought a six-pack of beer. Applicant consumed at least one of those beers  before he\n4\nwas pulled over for speeding in excess of 85 miles per hour and for reckless driving. He\nwas cooperative with the state highway patrolman, but he displayed objective indicators\nof intoxication (eyes red and watery, speech slow and slurred). Applicant was arrested\nfor DUI after he failed field sobriety tests. Applicant submitted to two preliminary alcohol\nscreens with the results .119% and .118% blood alcohol concentrations. Almost 1.5\nhours later, Applicant submitted to chemical testing at a county jail with a .09% blood\nalcohol reading. He was booked into the county jail and charged with two\nmisdemeanors, DUI and DUI .08% or greater. In September 2006, a stipulated no\ncontest plea was entered on Applicant\u2019s behalf to misdemeanor reckless driving\ninvolving alcohol,  a lesser included charge of DUI.  Applicant was placed on summary\n5\n6\nprobation for 36 months, conditioned on him paying fines and fees totaling $2,045 at\n$65 monthly commencing on October 12, 2006, completing a first offender DUI\nprogram, refraining from driving with any alcohol in his blood, submitting to any alcohol\ntesting at the request of any peace officer, and abiding by all laws and ordinances (Exs.\n1, 2, 4, 5). Following the incident, Applicant\u2019s assignment to special access programs at\nwork was limited (Ex. 3).\nIn early July 2006, Applicant was stopped en route to a friend\u2019s house because\npolice check of his registration showed that his license had expired. In addition to three\nunopened beers in a bag, Applicant had a partially consumed opened beer, which he\n\nApplicant told the government investigator in May 2007 that he had placed the opened beer in his\n7\nvehicle cupholder (Ex. 2), which is discrepant with the location of the open container as reported by the officer\non the scene (Ex. 6).\nApplicant explained at his hearing that as a first time driver in state Y, his license was valid for only\n8\none year and he had not realized that his license had expired (Tr. 46).\nConcerning his attendance at AA, Applicant testified that he attended around ten additional meetings,\n9\n\u201ceither once a week or once a month\u201d depending on his travel schedule (Tr. 67). W hen asked specifically what\nit was about his participation in AA that made others so uncomfortable to tell him to not return, Applicant\nresponded, \u201cIt was just over many, many classes, as they came to find, you know, know me, you know, and\nit was just more, you know, they just asked me, you know, the lady, you know\u2013\u201c (Tr. 80). Applicant provided\nno records of his counseling or his AA attendance. Applicant told the investigator in May 2007 that he had\nattended three AA meetings in December 2006. He did not discuss any additional meetings. To the contrary,\nhe told the investigator that the LADC recommended in March 2007 that he attend counseling with an LADC\nor self-help classes, which he did not attend (Ex. 2).\n5\ndenies drinking (\u201cI had opened the beer and I said I\u2019m not driving with alcohol on my\nbreath.\u201d Tr. 45). The officer found it wedged under the front of his driver\u2019s seat in plain\nview.  The officer noticed the open container, and he cited Applicant for transporting an\n7\nopen container of alcohol and for operating on an expired driver\u2019s license (Exs. 1, 2, 6,\n7). Applicant agreed to plead nolo contendere to the charge of operating without a valid\nlicense, for which he was fined.  The transportation of alcohol charge was continued for\n8\n12 months, on good behavior and completion of an evaluation with a licensed alcohol\nand drug counselor within 90 days (Ex. 8, Tr. 47-48). Applicant continued to consume\nalcohol after the July 2006 incident (Ex. 2, Tr. 45, 75).\nIn December 2006, Applicant attended twice weekly alcohol education sessions\nwith counselors in state Y to satisfy the alcohol program ordered by state Z (Tr. 63). He\nnow claims that he went to Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) meetings beyond the three\nrequired to reinforce for himself that he had made poor decisions. Applicant maintains\nthat AA members eventually asked him to stop coming to meetings \u201cbecause [he] was\nmaking other people who have problems feel awkward\u201d (Tr. 66).  He was unable to\n9\nrelate to the issues of other AA attendees (Tr. 81), but he came to realize that he could\nnot drive after drinking because of his body weight (Tr. 61).\nIn March 2007, Applicant was evaluated by a licensed alcohol and drug\ncounselor (LADC), who recommended that he obtain counseling or attend self-help\nclasses. Contrary to his recent claims that he attended about ten additional AA\nmeetings (Tr. 67), Applicant told a government investigator in May 2007 that he did not\nfollow the LADC\u2019s recommendations because he was not required to do so (Ex. 2). He\nbelieved his problem was not with alcohol but rather with \u201cgrowing up and making the\nright decisions\u201d (Tr. 65).\nApplicant, who had disclosed his alcohol-related offenses on his November 2006\ne-QIP (Ex. 1), was interviewed about his alcohol consumption by a government\ninvestigator on May 14, 2007. Applicant indicated he was drinking once a week, hard\nliquor or beer, while out to dinner or at the homes of family or friends. Applicant did not\nthink he had a problem with alcohol, but he admitted he had a problem not caring about\n\nHis recent testimony is discrepant with his admission during his May 2008 interview when he\n10\nindicated he was drinking once a week.\n6\nthe consequences of his drinking. He was no longer getting behind the wheel of a car\nafter drinking any alcohol, and was limiting his consumption to two drinks. Applicant\nexpressed his intent to maintain his current usage, and not revert to his previous\nbehavior (Ex. 2).\nIn October 2008, Applicant went to work as a systems engineer for his current\nemployer. Applicant was actively recruited for his position by a former coworker, who\nhad made the switch to the company about six months before him (Tr. 32, 34, 86, 103).\nApplicant\u2019s work for his new employer has continued to take him to different military\nbases (Tr. 34). While on a temporary duty assignment from which he returned in\nOctober 2009, Applicant had to be escorted to restricted areas, which served as a\nreminder to him of his past immature behavior (Tr. 35).\nAt his hearing, Applicant was asked to detail his alcohol consumption since the\nJuly 2006 incident. He responded that he went out drinking once a month, one or two\ndrinks at dinner, until January 2009 when he received the SOR (Tr. 75-76).  He\n10\nconsumed alcohol on about eight occasions in social contexts thereafter, no more than\ntwo beers per occasion (Tr. 78). He denied any driving after drinking alcohol (Tr. 69,\n80).\nApplicant owns the home that he shares with his girlfriend in state Y (Tr. 50-51).\nHe purchased the home in about May 2004 (Ex. 1). He hopes to marry his girlfriend in\n2010 (Tr. 24).\nAt his present employment, Applicant\u2019s work is directly supervised by the vice\npresident of advanced development programs. Applicant was hired to develop wireless\ntechnology for the U.S. military, and he performed very well in his first year on the job\n(Tr. 87). Applicant\u2019s supervisor was unaware of Applicant\u2019s alcohol offenses when he\nhired him. He learned of those issues about ten days before Applicant\u2019s hearing on his\nclearance eligibility (Tr. 90), and has no reservations about his decision to hire\nApplicant. Applicant has shown himself to be passionate about his work and he has not\nexhibited any behavior at work that would lead this supervisor to consider him a liability\nto the company or to the war fighter that they serve (Tr. 87-89). He has never seen\nApplicant consume any alcohol (Tr. 95).\nThe employee who brought Applicant into the company has had a professional\nrelationship with Applicant since 2002 from their previous employment (Tr. 109). They\nhave also had a personal relationship since about 2004 (Tr. 110). Applicant informed his\ncoworker of the alcohol incidents shortly after they happened in 2006 (Tr. 105). This\ncoworker was surprised because the incidents were \u201cout of character\u201d from his\nexperience with Applicant since 2002 (Tr. 117). In this coworker\u2019s opinion, Applicant has\ncontinued to be technically competent, very reliable, and willing to work extra hours in\nhis new job (Tr. 105-08). Every couple of months, this coworker and his wife get\ntogether with Applicant and his girlfriend for dinner at a restaurant. Through December\n\n7\n2008, this coworker had seen Applicant drink one beer or glass of wine, \u201cmaybe two,\u201d\nbut nothing more than that. Over the last six months, they have gotten together mostly\nin the mornings for breakfast. This coworker has not observed Applicant drink any\nalcohol in the past six months (Tr. 112). Applicant spends time with this coworker\u2019s\nfamily. This coworker trusts Applicant with his children (Tr. 108).\n \nA senior engineer, with 30 years at Applicant\u2019s prior employment, supervised\nApplicant on two different projects from 2002 until Applicant left the company in 2008.\nThey have had a social relationship since about 2007. This supervisor learned of the\n2006 incident from Applicant shortly after it occurred. Applicant also told him that he had\nnotified security personnel at work. Applicant\u2019s use of alcohol never affected his work.\nHe considers Applicant to be a social drinker and he would rehire him (Tr. 122-28). He\nlast observed Applicant drinking at Applicant\u2019s house in the summer of 2008 (Tr. 128).\nPolicies\nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion the Executive\nBranch has in regulating access to information pertaining to national security,\nemphasizing \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v.\nEgan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security\nclearance, the administrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines\n(AG). In addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative\nguidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are\nrequired to be considered in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified\ninformation. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c),\nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the\n\u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable\ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a\ndecision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based\non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the\ngovernment must present evidence to establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and\nother evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or\nproven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The applicant has the ultimate burden of\npersuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship\n\n8\ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government\nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk\nthat the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified\ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation\nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7\nof Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national\ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant\nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access\nto classified or sensitive information).\nAnalysis\nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption\nThe security concern for alcohol consumption is set out in AG \u00b6 21: \u201cExcessive\nalcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment or the failure\nto control impulses, and can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability and\nuntrustworthiness.\u201d AG \u00b6 22(a), \u201calcohol-related incidents away from work, such as\ndriving while under the influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace,\nor other incidents of concern, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an\nalcohol abuser or alcohol dependent,\u201d is implicated. While the May 2003 OUI charge\nwas continued without a finding for one year, Applicant admitted to sufficient facts to\nsustain a finding that he drove a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol. His blood\nalcohol level was over the legal limit. So too with the March 2006 DUI, the objective\nevidence indicates he was impaired by alcohol, notwithstanding his plea to a lesser\nincluded charge of reckless driving with alcohol. Applicant failed field sobriety tests, and\nhis blood alcohol level registered at .09% about 1.5 hours after his arrest. The evidence\ndoes not show that Applicant was impaired by alcohol when he was cited for the July\n2006 open container offense, although there is some evidence to suggest that he may\nhave consumed some of the alcohol. The police found the container partially consumed\nand located under the driver\u2019s seat. Even assuming he did not drink any alcohol in the\ncar, he exercised extremely poor judgment by transporting an open container only\nmonths after his second drunk driving offense that was still pending disposition.\nDespite the passage of more than three years since any evidence of abusive\ndrinking by Applicant, the recidivism of his drunk driving behavior, with the second DUI\noccurring almost three years after his first offense, makes it difficult to mitigate the\nalcohol consumption concerns under AG \u00b6 23(a) (stating, \u201cso much time has passed, or\nthe behavior was so infrequent, or it happened under such unusual circumstances that it\nis unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability,\ntrustworthiness, or good judgment\u201d).\nAG \u00b6 23(b), \u201cthe individual acknowledges his or her alcoholism or issues of\nalcohol abuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and has\nestablished a pattern of abstinence (if alcohol dependent) or responsible use (if an\nalcohol abuser)\u201d applies to some extent in that Applicant acknowledges that driving after\n\n9\ndrinking as few as two drinks was a problem for him. There is no evidence that he has\nbeen diagnosed as alcohol dependent or as an alcohol abuser, or that he engaged in\nhabitual or binge drinking. But police observations of Applicant\u2019s demeanor when he\nwas arrested for drunk driving, his failed field sobriety tests, and chemical test results,\nalong with the discrepant accounts of what and how much he drank (e.g., whether he\nconsumed Long Island Ice Tea or two beers after skiing and whether he consumed the\n\u201cthird beer\u201d before his arrest in 2006, whether he drank weekly or monthly between July\n2006 and January 2009) show some minimization by Applicant about his drinking.\nDespite the absence of any objective indicators of any difficulties controlling his alcohol\nconsumption since 2006, I am unable to conclude that his abusive drinking is safely in\nthe past. The LADC who evaluated Applicant in March 2007 recommended that he\nobtain counseling or at least attend self-help meetings. Applicant told a government\ninvestigator in May 2007 that he did not comply with those recommendations. Even\nassuming he attended about 13 AA meetings as he now claims, the benefit of that\nassociation is unclear, given he was told not to return. In May 2007, he indicated that he\nwas drinking once a week, hard liquor or beer. When asked at his hearing to detail his\nconsumption since July 2006, Applicant testified he drank only once a month. I cannot\nmake a reasonable assessment of his current drinking habits because his conflicting\naccounts would render any such assessment unreliable and speculative.\nWhole-Person Concept\nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the conduct\nand all the circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6\n2(a):\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nApplicant allowed alcohol to impair his judgment and reliability. He was operating\nat excessively high rates of speed, and was clearly under the influence of alcohol, when\nhe was arrested in May 2003 and March 2006. He put not only himself and his\npassenger, but also others on the roadway, at serious risk to life and limb. He maintains\nthat he no longer drives after consuming alcohol, and there is no evidence to the\ncontrary. His past and present supervisors, and the business manager who recruited\nhim for his current employment, have witnessed nothing about his behavior, on or off\nthe job, that would suggest Applicant is other than a social drinker who has made some\npoor decisions in the past that he does not intend to repeat. But Applicant fails to\npresent a convincing case for why he should be granted a security clearance\nnotwithstanding these serious drunk driving offenses. While I do not doubt the\n\n10\nimportance of his job to him, his expressed commitment to his duties and protecting the\nwar fighter did not prevent him from abusing alcohol when he was in state Z for work in\nMarch 2006. He testified that as a sign of his maturity, he bought a home. Yet the\nrecord evidence shows that he purchased that home in 2004, before his second drunk\ndriving offense. His relationship with his present girlfriend may provide the support he\nneeds, but he displayed immaturity by putting his personal interest in maintaining his job\nbefore his obligation to provide a consistent, credible account of his drinking habits.\nUnder \u00b6 6.2 of the Directive, Applicant is required to give full, frank, and truthful answers\nto inquiries that are relevant and material to a clearance decision. Concerns about his\ndrinking, his maturity, and his judgment lead me to conclude that it is not clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant Applicant a security clearance at this time.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline G:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of the record in this case, it is not clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to\nclassified information is denied.\nElizabeth M. Matchinski\nAdministrative Judge \n",

SOR Allegation 1a: Applicant is indebted to Bank of America (BA) in the amount of $9,519.00. In August 2008, he contacted the bank and suggested two options to settle the debt. In December 2008, he settled the debt for $3,253.29, which is to be paid in three monthly installments of $1,084.43 beginning on December 31, 2008. SOR Allegation 1b: Applicant was indebted to Chase in the amount of $2,228.00 on an account that had been placed for collection. Applicant settled this debt for $1,671.00 in September 2008. A letter dated October 3, 2008 from the creditor confirms applicant paid the settlement amount. SOR Allegation 1c: Applicant was indebted to WFFINANCE (WF). He admitted the SOR Allegation that the debt was in the approximate amount of $5,705.00, and that the debt had been charged off. However, there were different WF accounts listed in his old credit reports, and it appears that after applicant disputed the number of accounts with various credit reporting agencies in early 2008, long before the SOR was issued, all but one was removed. The most recent credit report in evidence that Department Counsel relies on (Exhibit 7) indicates a WF debt of $1,049.00.

He served\nhonorably for over twenty years in the U.S. military.\nSOR Allegation 1a: Applicant is indebted to Bank of America (BA) in the amount\nof $9,519.00. In August 2008, he contacted the bank and suggested two options to\nsettle the debt. In December 2008, he settled the debt for $3,253.29, which is to be paid\nin three monthly installments of $1,084.43 beginning on December 31, 2008.\nSOR Allegation 1b: Applicant was indebted to Chase in the amount of\n$2,228.00 on an account that had been placed for collection. Applicant settled this debt\nfor $1,671.00 in September 2008. A letter dated October 3, 2008 from the creditor\nconfirms applicant paid the settlement amount.\nSOR Allegation 1c: Applicant was indebted to WFFINANCE (WF). He admitted\nthe SOR Allegation that the debt was in the approximate amount of $5,705.00, and that\nthe debt had been charged off. However, there were different WF accounts listed in his\nold credit reports, and it appears that after applicant disputed the number of accounts\nwith various credit reporting agencies in early 2008, long before the SOR was issued, all\nbut one was removed. The most recent credit report in evidence that Department\nCounsel relies on (Exhibit 7) indicates a WF debt of $1,049.00. In his response to the\nFORM, applicant submitted a December 2008 letter from the current assignee of the\ndebt who reported that the debt stood at $1,244.14 and that the debt was settled with\napplicant for $950.00. Applicant stated he made the $950.00 payment. Based on the\nevidence presented, I find that applicant is no longer indebted to WF.\nApplicant and his wife have been separated since 2004 and are now in the\nprocess of getting divorced. In his response to the SOR, applicant stated some of his\nfinancial obligations were not addressed because of a failure of communication with his\nsoon to be ex-wife, as well as her failure to satisfy \u201cdivided debts\u201d as she had agreed.\nA letter from one of applicant\u2019s coworkers was admitted into evidence. In it, he\nstated applicant is reliable and trustworthy.\nPolicies\nThe President has \u201cthe authority to . . . control access to information bearing on\nnational security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to\noccupy a position that will give that person access to such information.\u201d (Department of\nthe Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518,527 (1988).) In Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information Within Industry (February 20, 1960), the President set out\nguidelines and procedures for safeguarding classified information within the executive\nbranch. The President authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant\napplicants eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is\nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d (Exec. Ord. 10865, Section 2.)\n\n3\nTo be eligible for a security clearance, an applicant must meet the security\nguidelines contained in the Directive. Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth personnel\nsecurity guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions\nunder each guideline.\nInitially, the Government must present evidence to establish controverted facts in\nthe SOR that disqualify or may disqualify the applicant from being eligible for access to\nclassified information. (Directive, Paragraph E3.1.14.) Thereafter, the applicant is\nresponsible for presenting evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts.\n(Directive, Paragraph E3. 1.15.) An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating\nthat it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security\nclearance.\u201d (ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002).) \u201cAny doubt as to\nwhether access to classified information is clearly consistent with national security will\nbe resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d (Directive, Paragraph E2.2.2.)\nA person granted access to classified information enters into a special\nrelationship with the government. The government must be able to repose a high\ndegree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information. The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not a\ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant. (Exec. Ord. 10865, Section 7.) It is\nmerely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President\nhas established for issuing a clearance.\nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern relating to Financial Considerations is set forth in\nParagraph 18 of the new AG, and is as follows:\nFailure or inability to live within one*s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual*s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially\noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate\nfunds.\nThe AG note several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nParagraph 19.a., an \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts\u201d is potentially\ndisqualifying. Under Paragraph 19.c., \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d may\nraise security concerns. The evidence shows applicant did have a few debts go\ndelinquent.  Accordingly, these disqualifying conditions are applicable.\nThe guidelines also set out mitigating conditions. Paragraph 20.a. may apply\nwhere \u201cthe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such\ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual*s\ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d Applicant has satisfied two of the\n\n4\nthree alleged debts and has reached a settlement agreement with the third creditor,\nwhich leaves his current delinquent indebtedness at $3,253.29. The little derogatory\nfinancial evidence the Government offered does not cast doubt on applicant\u2019s current\nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. Accordingly, this mitigation condition is\napplicable.\nUnder Paragraph 20.b., it may be mitigating where \u201cthe conditions that resulted\nin the financial problem were largely beyond the person*s control (e.g., loss of\nemployment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce\nor separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.\u201d Applicant\nstated his financial problems were caused by his wife from whom he has been\nseparated since 2004. However, he provided insufficient specific evidence to conclude\nhis financial problems were caused by factors largely beyond his control. Accordingly,\nthis mitigating condition is not applicable.\nEvidence that \u201cthe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control\u201d\nis potentially mitigating under Paragraph 20.c. It is clear the problem is under control.\nThis mitigating condition is applicable.\nParagraph d. applies where the evidence shows \u201cthe individual initiated a good-\nfaith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.\u201d Applicant has either\nsatisfied or settled all three debts. This mitigating condition is applicable.\n\u201cWhole Person\u201d Analysis \nUnder the whole person concept, the AJ must evaluate an applicant\u2019s security\neligibility by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all the circumstances.\nAn AJ should consider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG Paragraph\n2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances\nsurrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and\nrecency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct;\n(5) extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the\nconduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the\nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d Under AG Paragraph 2c, the ultimate\ndetermination of whether to grant a security clearance must be an overall common\nsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines and the whole\nperson concept.       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is a mature man who, after\nhonorably serving his country for over twenty years, fell behind on three financial\nobligations. Whether these delinquencies were caused by him or his wife is not entirely\nclear. What is clear, however, is that applicant began addressing these three\ndelinquencies before the SOR was issued, and since then has paid off two of the debts\nand has reached a repayment agreement with the third creditor. His current past-due\nindebtedness stands at a manageable $3,253.29, and it should be paid off by February\n\n5\n2009. Based on the evidence presented, I conclude applicant mitigated the security\nconcerns arising from Guideline F.\nFormal Findings     \nFormal findings for or against applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F: FOR APPLICANT\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with national security to grant applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.\n                                              \nJOSEPH TESTAN\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Howry, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: D. Christopher Russell, Esquire\n______________\nDecision\n______________\n \nCURRY, Marc E., Administrative Judge:\nFrom 1982 through 1992, Applicant committed multiple serious crimes including,\namong other things, burglary, and possession of marijuana. Since his release from\nprison in 1997, he has been a model citizen, excelling on the job, raising his family,\nearning a college degree, and volunteering in the community. Applicant has mitigated\nthe Criminal Conduct security concern. Clearance is granted.\nStatement of the Case\nOn April 30, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under Guideline J,\nCriminal Conduct. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines\n(AG) effective within the Department of Defense on September 1, 2006.\nJune 10, 2010\n\n2\nApplicant answered the SOR on June 18, 2009, admitting all of the allegations,\nand requesting a hearing. The case was assigned to another administrative judge, who\nscheduled it for December 9, 2009. Because of unexpected circumstances, the case\nwas continued, then reassigned to me on December 15, 2010. On January 13, 2010, a\nnotice of hearing was issued rescheduling the case for February 3, 2010. The hearing\nwas conducted as rescheduled. I received five Government exhibits, 18 Applicant\nexhibits, and the testimony of Applicant and two supporting witnesses. The transcript\n(Tr.) was received on February 16, 2010.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 46-year-old married man with two children, ages five and 14. He\nhas been married since 1998. He and his wife had their first child before they got\nmarried.\nApplicant had a rough childhood. (Tr. 76) He did not know his father until later in\nlife, and he was an eighth-grade dropout. (Tr. 49, 78) Although Applicant eventually\nearned a GED, he gravitated toward crime as he reached his late teens.\nIn 1982, Applicant stole a checkbook from a neighbor and forged a check.\nSubsequently, he was arrested and charged with forgery. He pleaded guilty, and was\nordered to pay restitution, sentenced to three years of probation, and ordered to pay\ncourt costs. (Answer)\nIn 1983, Applicant broke into a used car lot, stole the company\u2019s safe, and\nattempted to break it open. He was arrested, charged with uttering, breaking and\nentering, safecracking, and burglary. (Answer) He was convicted and sentenced to six\nto 25 years incarceration. (GE 5 at 14; Tr. 83) He was released after serving two and a\nhalf years.\nIn 1985, the Department of the Army conducted an investigation into allegations\nthat Applicant was selling marijuana to soldiers at a video arcade off base. (GE 1; Tr.\n86) As part of the investigation, Applicant sold some marijuana to an undercover military\npolice investigator. (Tr. 86) At the conclusion of the investigation, the Department of the\nArmy referred the case to the local authorities. (GE 1 at 3) There is no record of whether\nApplicant was charged criminally.\nIn 1986, Applicant got into a scuffle with an individual after an evening house\nparty. (Tr. 88) The scuffle spilled out of the home and into the street, ending when\nApplicant was pushed through the door of a neighborhood church. (Tr. 88) Applicant\nwas arrested and charged with criminal trespass and aggravated criminal damage. (Tr.\n89) The disposition of this case is unknown from the record.\nIn October 1986, the police apprehended Applicant while he was attempting to\nbreak into a store. (GE 5 at 10) He was arrested and charged with burglary. (Tr. 93) He\nwas convicted and sentenced to 12 months of intensive probation. (Tr. 93) Under the\n\n Under the prison regulations where Applicant was incarcerated, inmates were not allowed to have rolls of\n1\nquarters in excess of $10. Applicant was caught with rolls of quarters totaling $100. (Tr. 112)\n3\nterms of probation, Applicant was prohibited from going anywhere other than work and\nhome. Applicant violated the terms of the probation, and failed to appear at a status\nhearing. The court then ordered him to serve the remainder of the term in jail. (Tr. 97,\n111)\nWhile in jail, Applicant was charged with promoting prison contraband, a felony.1\n(Tr. 95) He was found guilty and sentenced to serve one additional year in prison. (GE 4\nat 3; GE 5 at 20; Tr. 95)\nIn December 1991, Applicant sold 39 grams of marijuana to an undercover\nmilitary police investigator. (AE 2 at 2) Approximately two weeks later, he called the\ninvestigator and asked if he wanted to purchase some more marijuana. They then met,\nand Applicant sold him 59 grams of marijuana. (Id. at 6) After scientific tests confirmed\nthat the substance Applicant sold the agent was marijuana, the Department of the Army\nclosed the case and referred it to the local police department. (Id. at 8)\nIn April 1992, the police, based upon a tip from an informant that Applicant was\n\u201chauling marijuana,\u201d stopped him and asked to search his car. (Tr. 98) He refused, and\nthey brought in a drug sniffing dog that \u201chit on the smell of marijuana.\u201d (Tr. 99) After a\nbrief struggle with Applicant, the police then searched the car and discovered a quarter\nounce of marijuana and some rolling papers. (GE 5 at 9; Tr. 99) Applicant was then\narrested and charged with sale of marijuana, possession of marijuana, resisting arrest,\naggravated assault of a police officer, and possession of drug paraphernalia. \nWhile these charges were pending, Applicant was charged with wrongful\ndistribution/possession of marijuana related to his selling marijuana to an undercover\nmilitary investigator in December 1991. (Tr. 101) The court consolidated both cases.(GE\n5 at 27)\nIn September 1992, Applicant was convicted of the sale of marijuana and\naggravated assault of a police officer. The court dismissed the other charges. Applicant\nwas released from custody pending sentencing.\nApplicant fled the state before the sentencing hearing. (Tr. 102) In 1995, he was\nextradited to the state where he committed the crimes. The court then sentenced him to\n3.75 years incarceration. Ultimately, he served 11 months, from September 1996 to\nAugust 1997, in a minimum security drug rehabilitation complex. (AE 3 at 29).\nAfter serving his sentence, Applicant took a job as a hotel proprietor. Late one\nnight, a woman came to the hotel and asked to reserve a room under someone else\u2019s\nname. (Tr. 70) Applicant refused, and the woman left. Approximately 30 minutes later,\nthe police arrived and told Applicant that the woman had accused him of groping her.\nApplicant denied the allegation, but was later charged with sexual abuse. (Tr. 72) The\n\n4\naccuser then moved without providing the prosecutor any forwarding information,\nprompting him to file a motion for dismissal. (GE 5 at 29) The court granted the motion\nand dismissed the case. I find Applicant did not commit the crime, as charged.\nApplicant has not used any illegal drugs, nor engaged in any other criminal\nbehavior since 1995. (GE 5 at 10) Also, he has \u201celiminated everybody from [his] past\nfrom [his] life.\u201d (Tr. 79)\nApplicant earned an associate\u2019s degree in applied science in 2004. (AE Q) One\nof his professors characterized him as a \u201cmotivated, intelligent, hardworking individual;\nin short, a model student.\u201d (AE C) Applicant earned a bachelor\u2019s of science degree in\napplied science in 2008. (AE N) His grade point average was a 3.3. (AE P)\nApplicant has worked in the information technology field since 2004. In 2006,\nApplicant began working for a defense contractor as a network administrator on a\nmilitary base. He is responsible for equipment, network switches, and routers for more\nthan 300 buildings and 700 customers. (AE E) According to his supervisor, he has high\nmorals, and performs all of his duties at or above average. (AE C) He has held an\ninterim security clearance for more than three and a half years.\nAccording to another senior-level administrator, Applicant constantly \u201cstrives to\nbetter his education.\u201d (AE D) Since 2003, he has earned 22 network administration\ncertifications. (AE O)\nOne of Applicant\u2019s college professors testified. (Tr. 26) He taught Applicant two\nrouting classes and one ethics class. (Tr. 26) He became increasingly interested in\nApplicant\u2019s career path after Applicant shared his troubled past with him. Applicant\nobtained the job on the military base, in part, from following the advice of this professor.\n(Tr. 32) Having observed Applicant\u2019s academic and professional growth, and evaluated\nhim in his ethics class, the professor considers Applicant to be a trustworthy individual\nwho \u201cdeserves a second chance.\u201d (Tr. 35)\nApplicant is active in the community. He volunteers for a program in which\nneighbors clean up debris and trash from local highways. (AE K) As the lead volunteer,\nhe is responsible for distributing orange vests and trash bags to the other volunteers.\n(Id.) \nPolicies\nIn addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative\nguidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are\nrequired to be considered in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified\ninformation. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a\nconscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d\n\n5\nThe administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the\nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion for obtaining a favorable security\ndecision.\nAnalysis\nUnder this guideline, \u201ccriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment,\nreliability, and trustworthiness\u201d (AG \u00b6 30). Also, \u201cby its very nature, it calls into question\na person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations\u201d (Id.).\nApplicant\u2019s ten-year history of criminal behavior including drug dealing and burglary,\ntriggers the application of AG \u00b6 31(a), \u201ca single serious or multiple lesser offenses.\u201d \nApplicant has not committed a crime in nearly 15 years. Since then, he has\ncompleted court-ordered drug rehabilitation, gotten married, and graduated from college\nwith honors. In the process of developing a career as a network analyst, he has\nobtained multiple training certifications. He has held an interim security clearance for the\npast three and a half years, without incident, while working on a military base. Also, he\nis a civic-minded individual who volunteers in his community. AG \u00b6\u00b6 32(a), \u201cso much\ntime has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened . . . that it is unlikely to recur\nand does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;\nand, 32(d), \u201cthere is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited to\nthe passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or restitution, job\ntraining or higher education, good employment record, or constructive community\ninvolvement,\u201d apply.\nWhole-Person Concept\nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\n\n6\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nFor ten years between 1982 and 1992, Applicant violated the law with impunity. I\nwas particularly troubled by his drug dealing on a military base, and his fleeing the state\nafter a 1992 conviction. \nApplicant has not committed a crime in more than 15 years. Since then, he has\nbeen a model citizen, working hard to advance his career, educating himself, raising his\nfamily, and volunteering in the community. Consequently, the serious and repetitive\nnature of his criminal conduct is outweighed by the presence of rehabilitation, the\nremoteness of the conduct, and his demonstrated maturity. I conclude that the\npossibility of recurrence is minimal, and that Applicant has mitigated the security\nconcern. In reaching this conclusion, I found the testimony of his ethics professor to be\nparticularly persuasive.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline J:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.i:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.\n                                             \nMARC E. CURRY\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Applicant\nrequested a hearing.  On August 26, 2008, after the hearing, Administrative Judge Claude R. Heiny\ndenied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant timely appealed pursuant to the\nDirective \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.1\nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s adverse clearance\ndecision is arbitrary, capricious or contrary to law.\nApplicant asks that the Judge\u2019s adverse decision be reversed, asserting that her financial\nproblems were the result of circumstances beyond her control and that she is in the process of\nresolving those problems.  Applicant has not demonstrated the Judge erred.\nThe presence of some mitigating evidence does not alone compel the Judge to make a\nfavorable security clearance decision.  As the trier of fact, the Judge has to weigh the evidence as a\nwhole and decide whether the favorable evidence outweighs the unfavorable evidence, or vice versa.\nSee, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-10320 at 2 (App. Bd. Nov. 7, 2007).  An applicant\u2019s disagreement with\nthe Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, or an ability to argue for a different interpretation of the\nevidence, is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence or reached conclusions in\na manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-17409 at 3\n(App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2007).\nIn this case, the Judge found that Applicant had a lengthy history of not meeting financial\nobligations.  At the time the case was submitted for decision, Applicant admitted owing\napproximately $31,000 on 42 past due or delinquent accounts, and was still in the process of trying\nto resolve her financial problems.   In light of the foregoing, the Judge could reasonably conclude\n2\nthat those problems were still ongoing.   See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 05-07747 at 2 (App. Bd. Jul. 3,\n2007).  The Judge weighed the mitigating evidence offered by Applicant against the length and\nseriousness of the disqualifying conduct and considered the possible application of relevant\nconditions and factors.  He reasonably explained why the mitigating evidence was insufficient to\novercome the government\u2019s security concerns.  The Board does not review a case de novo.  The\nfavorable evidence cited by Applicant is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge\u2019s decision is\narbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-11172 at 3 (App. Bd. Sep. 4,\n2007).  After reviewing the record, the Board concludes that the Judge examined the relevant data\n\n3\nand articulated a satisfactory explanation for his decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between\nthe facts found and the choice made.\u2019\u201d Motor Vehicle Mfrs.

Applicant has not successfully mitigated financial considerations concerns. \nClearance is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \n \nApplicant contests the Defense Department\u2019s intent to deny or revoke her \neligibility for an industrial security clearance. Acting under the relevant Executive Order \nand DoD Directive,1 the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued to \nApplicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) on May 23, 2008, detailing security concerns \n \n \n \n1\n                                                          \n1 Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance \nReview Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) \napproved by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for \nSORs issued after September 1, 2006. \nAugust 26, 2008\n\n \n \n \n2\nunder Guideline F, financial considerations, based on a history of financial problems as \nshown by delinquent debts. \n  \n \nOn June 13, 2008, Applicant answered the SOR, and requested a hearing before \nan administrative judge. On July 10, 2008, I was assigned the case. On July 10, 2008, \nDOHA issued a notice of hearing scheduling the hearing held on August 5, 2008. The \ngovernment offered Exhibits (Ex.) 1 through 4, which were admitted into evidence. \nApplicant testified on her own behalf.  \n \nThe record was kept open to allow Applicant to submit additional matters. On \nAugust 12, 2008, documents were received. There being no objection, the material was \nadmitted into evidence as Ex. A. On August 16, 2008, Additional documents were \nreceived and admitted as Ex. B. On August 14, 2008, the transcript (Tr.) was received.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn her Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted 42 of the past due debts listed in \nSOR \u00b6 1. She denies her car note (\u00b6 1. jj) is past due and states two other debts \u00b6\u00b6 (1.rr \nand 1.ss) have been removed from her credit report. The admissions are incorporated \nherein as findings of fact. After a thorough review of the record, case file, pleadings, \nexhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of fact. \n \n \nApplicant is a 28-year-old executive assistant who has worked for a defense \ncontractor since October 2007, and is seeking to obtain a security clearance. The \noperations manager believes Applicant to be extremely hardworking, tenacious, honest, \nforthright, and possessing a strong drive and work ethic. She inspires those around her \nto strive for greater achievement and is a highly trusted and valued member of the \nteam, who is committed to excellence. (Ex. A) Coworkers believe Applicant is punctual, \nthoughtful, willing to work late, has impeccable integrity, and is an individual of high \nmoral character. (Ex. B)  \n \n \nApplicant admits owing 42 past due accounts totaling approximately $31,000. \nNon-medical debts, totaling approximately $20,000, account for 18 of the debts. The \namount owed on 15 of the delinquent obligations was $100 or less on each debt, of \nwhich many were co-pays for medical treatment. (Tr. 18) She is current on her car loan, \nhas no credit cards, no loans, and no debt in addition to that listed in the SOR, and \nmaintains a monthly budget. (Tr. 18, 44) Her current salary is approximately $42,000 \nand her husband\u2019s salary is $43,000. Applicant and her husband\u2019s monthly disposable \nincome (gross income less expenses) is approximately $600. (Exs. A and B) Since \n2005, Applicant has paid her rent on time and has never been a problem for either of \nher two most recent landlords. (Ex. A)  \n \nApplicant\u2019s debts was contributed to by her unemployment, time lost due to \nmedical reasons, and her husband\u2019s unemployment. Applicant underwent two high risk \npregnancies resulting in the birth of her children in December 1998 and April 2001. (Tr. \n62). Internal bleeding, unrelated to the pregnancies, resulted in a number of \nhospitalizations for Applicant, one in May 2002. (Tr. 30, 62) She had two additional \n\n \n \n \n3\nsurgeries, one to remove her spleen and the other for tubal ligation. (Tr. 29) She has \nexperienced periods of separation from her husband. (Tr. 35) \n \nIn July 2000, Applicant and her husband moved to a new state due to her \nhusband\u2019s job in the telecommunications field. He was making $31,000 a year. (Tr. 28) \nShe had a job at a day care for about four months before resigning due to a high risk \npregnancy. (Tr. 28) Her husband was laid off from his job. \n \nFrom February 2001 to July 2004, she was a receptionist and medical assistant. \nShe also had a part time job working in a store. (Tr. 32) In November 2002, she was \ncharged $2,238 (SOR \u00b6 1.c) for breach of lease. Her lease ended, but was charged two \nmonths rent for failing to notify the landlord she was terminating the lease. (Tr. 17) The \ncreditor has offered to settle the debt for $1,200. (Tr. 39) No documentation was \nprovided as to acceptance of the offer. From March 2004 to December 2005, she was a \nteacher in a private day school. In 2005, her husband was laid off from his \ntelecommunications job.  \n \nApplicant and her husband had two cars. When her husband lost his job they had \nto give up one of the cars. (Tr.18) They voluntarily surrendered the 2001 Nissan, which \nresulted in an $11,000 debt. (SOR \u00b6 1.q, $11,615)  \n \nAnother landlord obtained a $3,823 default judgment (SOR \u00b6 1.ss) against \nApplicant and her husband. This debt is not the same as the debt owed the apartment \ncomplex listed in SOR \u00b6 1.c ($2,238) or the debt owed the apartment complex in SOR \u00b6 \n1.d ($722). \n \nIn 2005, she was evicted from her apartment for non-payment of rent (Tr. 30) and \nshe moved into her mother\u2019s house paying $500 per month. During her two-year stay, \nApplicant always paid her rent on time and was an excellent tenant. (Ex. A) From \nDecember 2005 to October 2006, Applicant was a teacher at a children\u2019s center. \n  \nFrom October 2006 to August 2007, she worked as a project accountant. She \nwas unemployed from August 2007 to October 2007, when she secured her present \njob. Her husband has been working at his current job for two years and his job appears \nto be stable. Applicant\u2019s current net pay is approximately $600 per week. (Ex. B) \n \nThe SOR alleges 45 debts totaling in excess of $38,000. Applicant asserts that \nsome of the debts may be duplicates, (Tr. 17) but provided no documentation to support \nwhich debts reflect the same obligations. In November 2007, she started looking for a \nfinancial management company to assist her with her finances and found one in June \n2008. (Tr. 40) \n \nApplicant agreed to pay the financial management company $1,000 per month \nwith the first payment due July 15, 2008. She postponed the first payment when her car \nwas involved in an accident requiring $2,000 in repairs. (Tr. 19) She provided no \ndocumentation showing payment on August 15, 2008. She is currently waiting for \n\n \n \n \n4\nstatements from her some creditors to add to the repayment schedule. There is no \ndocumentation as to which debts are covered by the repayment agreement. \n \nIn 2006, she attended a money management class and has learned to assign \npriorities to her debts.  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n  \n\n \n \n \n5\nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \n \nRevised Adjudicative (AG) \u00b6 18 articulates the security concerns relating to \nfinancial problems: \n \nFailure or inability to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds. \n \nAdditionally, an individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, negligent, or careless in properly handling and \nsafeguarding classified information. Behaving responsibly or irresponsibly in one aspect \nof life provides an indication of how a person may behave in other aspects of life.  \n \nA person\u2019s relationship with her creditors is a private matter until evidence is \nuncovered demonstrating an inability or unwillingness to repay debts under agreed \nupon terms. Absent evidence of strong extenuating or mitigating circumstances, an \napplicant with a history of serious or recurring financial difficulties is in a position of risk \nthat is inconsistent with holding a security clearance. An applicant is not required to be \ndebt free, but is required to manage her finances so as to meet her financial obligations. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s history of delinquent debt is documented in her credit report, her SOR \nresponse, and her testimony at the hearing. Throughout this process, she had admitted \nresponsibility for 42 delinquent debs, totaling approximately $31,000. She has provided \ninsufficient documentation to show significant progress resolving these debts. \nDisqualifying Conditions AG \u00b6 19(a), \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts\u201d and AG \n\u00b619(c), \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations,\u201d apply.  \n \n \nFive Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions under AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a) \u2013 (e) are \npotentially applicable: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n\n \n \n \n6\n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control; \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a) has some applicability. Applicant=s financial problems were \ncontributed to by her medical problems and both her and her husband\u2019s unemployment. \nHer husband works in the telecommunications field which has been filled with \nuncertainty in the recent past. He has been working at his current job for two years and \nhis job appears stable. Applicant\u2019s medical problems are unlikely to recur. Her spleen \nhas been removed and additional high risk pregnancies will not reoccur. However, more \nthan 40 debts remain unpaid.  \n \nUnder AG & 20(b), Applicant experience periods of separation, unemployment, \nand medical expenses, all of which caused financial problems that were beyond her \ncontrol. However, Applicant has been employed for ten months and her husband has \nbeen employed for more than two years. Their combined income is approximately \n$83,000 and the only debt that has been addressed is the monthly car payment, which \nhas been brought current. Fifteen of Applicant\u2019s debts are under $100 each. Nine of the \nSOR debts are $50 or less. None of even these smaller debts have been paid. With so \nlittle payment made, I find Applicant has not acted reasonably. AG & 20(b) does not \napply. \n \nAG & 20(c) does not apply. Although Applicant has received some financial \ncounseling, there is no showing the financial problem is being resolved or is under \ncontrol.  \n \nAG & 20(d) does not apply because there is no good faith effort to repay the \ndelinquent debts. In June 2008, following the receipt of the SOR, Applicant obtained \nassistance from a financial management company. She has yet to make the first \npayment to the company. She was to make a payment in mid-July 2008, but car repairs \nrequired delaying that payment. The debts included in the financial management \ncompany\u2019s repayment plan are unknown.  \n \nWhole Person Concept \n\n \n \n \n7\n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.  \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. The debts incurred were not the \ntype that indicates poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules \nand regulations. Money was not spent frivolously. The debts set forth in the SOR were \nnot incurred on luxuries, but were for medical treatment, rent, utilities, and insurance. \nApplicant does not appear to have incurred additional obligations not listed in the SOR. \nShe has no credit cards, no loans, or other delinquent obligations other than those listed \nin the SOR. Applicant has held a part-time job. Maintaining a part-time job while having \na full-time job shows a strong desire by Applicant\u2019s to address her debts.  \n \nHowever, of the more than 40 past due obligations, her monthly car payment is \nthe only debt she has addressed. Bring her car payment current is insufficient to \nestablish rehabilitation or other permanent positive behavioral changes. Overall, the \nrecord evidence leaves me with questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and \nsuitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant has not \nmitigated the security concerns arising from her financial considerations.  \n \nThis decision should not be construed as a determination that Applicant cannot \nor will not attain the state of true reform and rehabilitation necessary to justify the award \nof a security clearance. The awarding of a security clearance is not a once in a life time \noccurrence, but is based on applying the factors, both disqualifying and mitigating, to \nthe evidence presented. Applicant is highly thought of at her work. Under the current \ncircumstances a clearance is not recommended, but should Applicant be afforded an \nopportunity to reapply for a security clearance in the future, having paid the delinquent \nobligations, established compliance with a repayment plan, or otherwise addressed the \ndelinquent obligations, she may well demonstrate persuasive evidence of her security \nworthiness. However, a clearance at this time is not warranted.  \n \n\n \n \n \n8\nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a \u2013 1ii: \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.jj:  \nFor Applicant  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.ll \u2013 1.ss: Against Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.
