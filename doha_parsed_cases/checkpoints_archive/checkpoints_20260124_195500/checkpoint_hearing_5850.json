ABLARD\nAPPEARANCES\nFOR GOVERNMENT\nNichole Noel, Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nSYNOPSIS\nApplicant, a 48-year-old scientist with a major defense contractor, failed to mitigate personal\nconduct security concerns relating to failure to give accurate answers to Questions 19 and 20 on his\nSF 86 relating to circumstances of his leaving former employment growing out of two incidents of\naccessing pornography on his company computer and the type of mental health treatment received\nas a result of those incidents and depression. Clearance is denied. \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn March 20, 2007, the Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) pursuant to Executive\n\n2\nOrder 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry as amended and modified, and\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended and modified, issued a Statement of\nReasons (SOR) to Applicant which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary\naffirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant\nor continue a security clearance for Applicant. DOHA recommended the case be referred to an\nadministrative judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or\nrevoked.\nIn a sworn written statement, received March 27, 2007, Applicant responded to the\nallegations set forth in the SOR, and requested a hearing. The case was assigned to another judge on\nJuly 11, 2007, and re-assigned to me on July 16, 2007. A Notice of Hearing was issued July 20, 2007\nfor a hearing held on August 9, 2007. The Government introduced three exhibits and Applicant\nintroduced six. All were accepted into evidence. An investigator testified for the government.\nApplicant and three witnesses testified on behalf of Applicant. The transcript was received on\nAugust 20, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant admitted with explanation three of the four SOR allegations relating to personal\nconduct security concerns. He denied the fourth. After a complete review of the record, I make the\nfollowing additional findings of fact:\nApplicant is a 48-year-old employee of a major defense contractor working as a senior\nprincipal engineer since 1999. He holds a B.S., Master\u2019s, and Ph.D. in electrical engineering. Before\nhis present employment he worked in a similar field for another major defense contractor for 12\nyears between 1987 and 1999. He has held a security clearance for 20 years. While employed at his\nformer employer he accessed pornographic sites on his company computer on two occasions on\nOctober 23, and October 25, 1997. The total time for both occasions was almost four hours. As a\nresult he received a reprimand, was placed on a 30 day suspension without pay, and cited for an\nethics violation. Only two weeks before the incident he attended his first computer training during\nwhich time he was cautioned against using the computer for such purposes. He was advised that any\nfurther mis-use of the computer would result in further sanctions including termination of his\nemployment (Exh. 3 Item 3). \nOn November 18, 1999, Applicant again used his company computer to access pornographic\nsites and when confronted with the allegation, denied it. He told investigators that a colleague who\nwas a personal friend of his might have used his computer, or cleaning personnel who had access\nto his office. When the investigators looked into the matter, neither of these leads was productive.\nApplicant was again interviewed and admitted that he had accessed the sites. He was told that he\nwould again be placed on leave without pay as had been done before. Consideration was given to\ndischarging him since there had been three separate violations on three dates (Exh. 3) although he\nmay not have been aware of those company deliberations. He resigned from the company on March\n2, 1999. He was engaged to teach at a university for the Spring semester of 1999 and was hired by\nhis present employer in July 1999. When he was interviewed at the company he advised them of the\ncircumstances of his departure from his former employer (Exh. B). \n\n3\nOn March 31, 2004, Applicant filed an application for security clearance renewal (SF 86) in\nwhich he answered two questions relating to medical treatment and reasons for leaving a former\nemployment which are the basis for the actions to revoke or deny his security clearance. Question\n19 asks whether an applicant has consulted with a mental health professional in the last seven years\nabout a mental health related condition, and if that consultation involved only marital, family, or\ngrief counseling not related to violence. Applicant answered \u201cyes\u201d to both parts of the question.\nQuestion 20 asks about employment record and specifically asks if an applicant had left employment\nby mutual agreement following allegations of misconduct, or left by mutual agreement following\nallegations of unsatisfactory performance. Applicant answered \u201cno\u201d to this question. \nAfter he resigned from his position with his former employer, Applicant had serious\ndepression occasioned by the circumstances of his departure as well as the trauma of an automobile\naccident that could have, but did not, cause fatalities in his family. He sought the care of a\npsychiatrist and saw him for 12 or more counseling sessions in late 1999 and early 2000. His wife\nattended several of these with him concerning the impact his actions had on their marital\nrelationship. He was diagnosed as having an impulse control disorder and being \u201cego distonic\u201d\nmeaning that he did not act the way he believed he should have based on his religious and moral\nbeliefs (Exh. 3. p. 4). After the counseling concluded, Applicant was discharged and the doctor\nconcluded that he had made positive changes with a favorable prognosis. He also concluded that\nApplicant did not have a condition that could adversely impact his judgment or reliability or ability\nto safeguard classified information. \nApplicant was interviewed by an investigator under contract with the government on\nFebruary 16, 2005 about several subjects but primarily about the events leading to his resigning his\nemployment and his psychiatric treatment (Exh. 2). Applicant gave the investigator his permission\nto interview his psychiatrist which he did. The investigator was advised that Applicant\u2019s treatment\nwas related to depression and job loss. \nApplicant testified that he believed when he left his former employment, that no record of\nhis misconduct existed in the company personnel files and that he was leaving on good terms. The\nofficial file from the company and a transmittal letter (Exh. 3) indicates that he resigned in lieu of\ntermination which meant that he could not be re-hired. His former supervisor believes that it is quite\nlikely Applicant was told that he was leaving on good terms and believed it, but the company did\nmake such representations that later proved not to be so reflected in company records. (Exh. A). \nApplicant has been married for 23 years and has three children ages 20, 18 and 14. His oldest\nchild is now working successfully as an intern for his present company. He is highly regarded by\ncolleagues and supervisors at his present company who submitted letters on his behalf or testified\nat the hearing for his skills and dedication during his eight years of service (Exhs. B-E, and Tr. 105-\n126). He is also highly regarded for his work and skills at his former company during the period of\nhis employment (Exh. A).\nPOLICIES\n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S.\n518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has \u201cthe authority to control access to\ninformation bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently\n\n4\ntrustworthy to occupy a position that will give that person access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527.\nAn evaluation of whether the applicant meets the security guidelines includes consideration\nof the following factors: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances\nsurrounding the conduct; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and\nmaturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence\nof rehabilitation and other behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential\nfor pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\n-------Security clearances are granted only when \u201cit is clearly consistent with the national interest to\ndo so.\u201d Executive Order No. 10865 \u00a7 2. See Executive Order No. 12968 \u00a7 3.1(b).\nInitially, the Government must establish, by something less than a preponderance of the\nevidence, that conditions exist in the personal or professional history of the applicant which\ndisqualify, or may disqualify, the applicant from being eligible for access to classified information\nSee Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. The applicant then bears the burden of demonstrating it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance. \u201cAny doubt as to\nwhether access to classified information is clearly consistent with national security will be resolved\nin favor of the national security.\u201d -----\u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must,\non the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. See Executive Order No. 12968 \u00a7 3.1(b).\nCONCLUSIONS\nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all appropriate\nadjudicative factors, I conclude the following with respect to all allegations set forth in the SOR:\nThe Government established each of the allegations under Guideline E Personal Conduct\nalleged in the SOR. The revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) are applicable to cases with an SOR\ndated after September 1, 2006. The specific condition applicable to this case is AG \u00b6 16 (a)\nconcerning Applicant\u2019s deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any\npersonnel security questionnaire used to conduct investigations or to determine security clearance\neligibility. \nMitigating conditions (MC) that might be applicable include under AG \u00b6 17(a) that the\nindividual made prompt, good faith efforts to correct the omission, concealment, or falsification\nbefore being confronted with the facts, and under AG \u00b6 17(c) if the fact that the offense is so minor,\nor so much time has passed, or happened under such unique circumstances that it is unlikely to recur\nand does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\nApplicant may have believed that no adverse record existed of his departure but in view of\nthe exchange of documents that occurred after each incident (Exh. 3 Items 1,2, and 3), he certainly\nshould have known that circumstances such as those described in Question 20 had occurred and\ntaken the opportunity to answer it correctly and give whatever explanation he believed to be\nwarranted. He did neither. The fact that he advised his new employer of the circumstances of his\ndeparture illustrates that he knew the circumstances under which he left and they were not favorable\n\n5\ncircumstances. \nAs to his answer to Question 19, again Applicant knew that his psychiatric counseling was\nnot totally related to marital counseling even though his wife was a participant in some of the\nsessions. Counseling relating to depression and  his job loss did not relate solely to marital or grief\ncounseling as it is commonly understood and should have been understood by him. \nThus, I conclude that Applicant answers to both questions at issue were erroneous and\ndeliberate and that none of the mitigating conditions are  applicable. While the conduct leading to\nhis leaving his employment is now over eight years ago and could be mitigated by time and changed\ncircumstances including his psychiatric evaluation, his deceptive answers on his SF 86 occurred only\nthree years ago and I conclude against him on those two issues.\nIn all adjudications the protection of our national security is of paramount concern. Persons\nwho have access to classified information have an overriding responsibility for the security concerns\nof the nation. The objective of the security clearance process is the fair-minded, commonsense\nassessment of a person\u2019s trustworthiness and fitness for access to classified information. The \u201cwhole\nperson\u201d concept recognizes we should view a person by the totality of their acts and omissions. Each\ncase must be judged on its own merits taking into consideration all relevant circumstances, and\napplying sound judgment, mature thinking, and careful analysis. \nIn evaluating his behavior in terms of the \u201cwhole person concept\u201d(AG \u00b6 2), an applicant may\nmitigate security concerns by demonstrating the factors leading to the violation are not likely to\nrecur(\u00b6 9),), and evidence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes (\u00b6 6). The\nincidents that gave rise to this proceeding may not be likely to recur. However, the SOR allegations\nall relate to the security clearance process and his willingness to be candid in providing responses.\nThere certainly is evidence of remorse for the conduct at his former company and belief that it was\naberrational conduct. \nHowever, Applicant\u2019s failure to acknowledge the circumstances of his leaving his former\nemployment and the type of mental health issues for which he sought treatment affects his\ncredibility. In his testimony at the hearing, he continued to equivocate about the circumstances of\nhis resignation, and the purposes of the mental health treatment he received. His knowledge of the\nsecurity process over a 20 year period should have helped him avoid these problems but it did not.\nAfter considering all the evidence in its totality, and as an integrated whole to focus on the\nwhole person of Applicant, I conclude a security clearance should not be granted to him. \nFORMAL FINDINGS \nFormal findings as required by the Directive (Par. E3.1.25) are as follows:\nParagraph 1. Guideline E:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a.:\nFor Applicant\n\n6\nSubparagraph 1.b.:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c.:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d.:\nAgainst Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or renew a security clearance for Applicant.

Dvorak, Esquire \n \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nHEINY, Claude R., Administrative Judge: \n \nIt was alleged Applicant had eight accounts placed for collection or past due \ntotaling in excess of $26,000. He paid four of the debts and is not responsible for the \nother four debts. Applicant has successfully mitigated financial considerations and \npersonal conduct concerns. Clearance is granted. \n \nOn April 4, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under Guideline F, \nFinancial Considerations for Applicant. The action was taken under Executive Order \n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the \nrevised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, \n2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September \n1, 2006.  \n  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR, and requested a hearing before an Administrative \nJudge. On December 11, 2007, DOHA issued a notice of hearing for a hearing held on \nJanuary 14, 2008. On December 18, 2007, I was assigned the case, the case having \n \n1\nMarch 14, 2008\n\n \n2\npreviously been assigned to a different judge. The government offered Exhibits (Ex.) 1 \nthrough 4, which were admitted into evidence. Applicant testified on his own behalf and \nsubmitted Exhibits A through J, which were admitted into evidence.  \n \nThe record was kept open to submit additional matters. Additional documents \nwere received on February 1, 2008, which Department Counsel (DC) did not object to, \nand was admitted as Ex. K.  DC did object as untimely the admission of material sent on \nFebruary 19, 2008. I find the material to be relevant and material and admit it as Ex. L. \nOn January 30, 2008, DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) of the hearing.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, dated May 1, 2007, Applicant denied responsibility for \nthe debts listed in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.g and admitted responsibility for the debts listed in \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.c, 1.d, 1.e, 1.f and 1.h of the SOR, with explanations. He also provided \nadditional information to support his request for eligibility for a security clearance.  \n \n \nApplicant is a 55-year-old audio visual technician who has worked for a defense \ncontractor since July 1996, and is seeking to maintain a security clearance. Coworkers \nand supervisors indicate Applicant never spent lavishly and has displayed outstanding \ntalents. (Ex G and H) Applicant received an honorable discharge after serving twenty \nyears in the Army. In June 1995, he retired at the grade of E-5. (Tr. 20) \n \n \nA number of times when Applicant was overseas for duty or work, he gave his \nwife financial powers of attorney (POA). She abused the POAs. She purchased vehicles \nfor their children even when some of them did not have driver\u2019s licenses. (Tr. 29) She \nused the POA to make changes preventing him access to his retirement account and \nchecking account. (Tr. 29) He and his wife were unable to meet their financial \nobligations with their five children. When he discovered her overspending, he filed for \nbankruptcy protection and began divorce proceedings. In December 1996, Applicant \ncommenced the Chapter 7 bankruptcy. (Ex. 4) In March 2002, Applicant and his wife \ndivorced. (Ex. A) All child support related to the divorce ended in 2003. (Tr. 51) \n \n \nThe divorce decree granted his ex-wife possession of the 1994 van and he kept \nthe 1995 pickup. The decree required his ex-wife to hold Applicant harmless for any \nliability on the vehicle and was to sell or refinance the vehicle within six months to \nremove the husband from any further liability. (Ex A. p.6) He was to do the same on the \ntruck. The van was purchased in October 1997 for $14,317 with monthly payments of \n$390. (Ex. 3) Timely payments were made on the van for at least two years before an \ninvoluntary repossession occurred. (Ex. 3) Applicant was unaware the vehicle had been \nrepossessed until he learned of it from the investigator during an interview. (Tr. 72)  \n \n \nThe credit reports list two auto accounts opened at the same time with monthly \npayments of $390 and $391. The two accounts are with the same company although \none account lists the company solely by its initials (SOR \u00b6 1.g) and the other account \ngave a full name (SOR \u00b6 1.b). Theses two accounts are obligations on the same \nvehicle. The credit reports (Ex. 3, 4) indicate the last activity on the accounts occurred in \n2001. \n\n \n3\n \n \nIn September 2007, Applicant completed a monthly income and expense \nstatement. (Ex. B) Applicant still owns his 1995 truck. (Tr. 31) His income, year to date, \nwas approximately $47,000. As of December 21, 2007, his yearly income was $51,000. \n(Ex. C) His monthly income, not including overtime, was $3,600 and his monthly \nexpenses approximately $3,000. (Ex. B) His monthly income, with overtime, exceeds \nhis monthly expenses by $1,275. (Tr. 35) Applicant has $19,000 in a company savings \nplan retirement program. (Ex. D) He has $6,600 in his checking accounts, $1,000 in \nsavings, $1,200 in one bank, and $7,200 in another bank. (Tr. 108, 109)  \n \n \nIn late January 2007, Applicant received an interrogatory asking about ten \naccounts, seven of which were medical debts. Applicant sent five creditors letters \nstating he was unfamiliar with the past due accounts listed in his credit report (Ex. E) \nasking for information verifying the debts. The two auto accounts were included in the \nletters asking for verification. (Ex. 2) \n \n \nIn January 2007, Applicant paid the $163 owed on the medical bill listed in SOR \n\u00b6 1.c. (Ex. F) In April 2007, he paid the $502 owed on the medical debt listed in SOR \u00b6 \n1.e. (Ex. F) In January 2007 and April 2007, Applicant paid other debts not listed in the \nSOR. Following the hearing, Applicant paid the $421 medical debt listed in SOR \u00b6 1.a. \n(Ex K) \n \n \nIn late January 2008, Applicant again contacted the telephone company \nattempting to get information concerning the $374 phone debt. (SOR \u00b6 1.f) Applicant \nasserts he paid this debt in full in 2001 and was informed the debt had been paid in full. \n(Ex. K)  \n \n \nAs retired military, Applicant and his minor children would be entitled to medical \ncare through Tricare or treatment at military facilities. (Tr. 138) He would not be liable if \nhis ex-wife took any of the grandchildren to receive medical attention. In checking with a \ncollection agency holding two hospital obligations, he was informed the $6,465 hospital \ndebt (SOR \u00b6 1.h) was not his debt, but was his ex-wife\u2019s obligation. The collection \nagency agreed to have both hospital bills (SOR \u00b6 1.d and 1.h) deleted from his credit \nbureau account because the creditor could not verify Applicant was the responsible \nparty. (Ex. L) \n \n \nA summary of the debts follows: \n \nSOR Creditor \nAmount \nCurrent Status \n1.a \nMedical debt. \n \n$421 \nPaid. (Ex.

In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \n\n \n5\n                                                          \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \n \nUnder Guideline F (financial considerations) a security concern typically exists \ndue to significant unpaid debts. Failure or inability to live within one's means, satisfy \ndebts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about \nan individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information.1 \n \n \nAn individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in \nillegal or unethical acts to generate funds to meet financial obligations. Additionally, an \nindividual who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, unconcerned, \nnegligent, or careless in properly handling and safeguarding classified information. \nBehaving responsibly or irresponsibly in one aspect of life provides an indication of how \na person may behave in other aspects of life.  \n \nA person\u2019s relationship with his creditors is a private matter until evidence is \nuncovered demonstrating an inability or unwillingness to repay debts under agreed \nupon terms. Absent evidence of strong extenuating or mitigating circumstances, an \napplicant with a history of serious or recurring financial difficulties is in a position of risk \nthat is inconsistent with the holding of a security clearance. An applicant is not required \nto be debt free, but is required to manage his finances so as to meet his financial \nobligations. \n \n \nThe record evidence supports a conclusion Applicant has a history of financial \nproblems. The SOR alleges Applicant owed approximately $26,000 on eight accounts \nplaced for collection or past due obligations. Disqualifying Conditions (DC) \u00b6 19(a), \n\u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts\u201d and 19(c), \u201ca history of not meeting financial \nobligations,\u201d apply.  \n \n \n1 Revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) \u00b6 18. \n\n \n6\nThe guideline provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. Under AG \u00b6 20(c), evidence that Athe person has received or is \nreceiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear indications that the problem \nis being resolved or is under control@ is potentially mitigating. Similarly, AG & 20(d) \napplies where the evidence shows Athe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.@  \n \nApplicant paid four of the debts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.c, 1.e, and 1.f.) The credit \ncollection agency holding the two largest medical bills (SOR 1.d, $918 and SOR \u00b6 1.h, \n$6,465) agreed to delete the accounts from Applicant\u2019s credit report because the \ncollection agency was unable to verify Applicant was the responsible party. Since the \ncreditor is no longer actively seeking to collect the debt; Applicant is not at risk of having \nto engage in illegal or unethical acts to generate funds to meet this debt. \n \nThe remaining two debts are with the same company, were opened on the same \ndate, and the monthly payments were $390 and $391, which indicates the two accounts \nare one and the same obligation. The debt arises from the repossession of his ex-wife\u2019s \nvan. He was unaware of the repossession until asked about it during the security \ninvestigation. The divorce decree clearly states his ex-wife is entitled to possession of \nthe van and agreed to hold Applicant harmless for any liability therefore. She was \nrequired to sell or refinance the vehicle within six months to remove the husband from \nany liability therefore. She did not do this and an obligation was incurred following \nrepossession of the vehicle.  \n \nApplicant was initially jointly liable on this debt. The divorce decree does not limit \nthe original creditor\u2019s ability to hold Applicant liable on the debt. If the creditor pursued \nthe matter, Applicant could be found liable on the debt and could in turn bring an action \nagainst his ex-wife for satisfaction. The last action taken by the creditor, on either of the \ndebts, occurred in 2001. There is no evidence the obligation is barred by the Statute of \nLimitations, but there is also no evidence the creditor is actively seeking collection from \nApplicant. It is unlikely Applicant is at risk of having to engage in illegal or unethical acts \nto generate funds to meet this debt. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 20(a), the disqualifying condition may be mitigated where Athe \nbehavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual=s \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ The obligation arose following his \ndivorce and his wife\u2019s failure to honor the divorce decree. These are circumstances that \nare unlikely to recur. Failure to pay an obligation where no one is actively seeking to \ncollect the debt does not raise concerns about Applicant\u2019s current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness \n\n \n7\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation \nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent \nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.  \n \nThe debts incurred were not the type that indicates poor self-control, lack of \njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations. Money was not spent \nfrivolously. The debts were not incurred on luxuries, but more than half were for medical \ntreatment. His ex-wife\u2019s failure to honor the divorce decree fails to show extravagance \non Applicant\u2019s part or living beyond his means. \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. The SOR listed eight debts of which \nApplicant paid four and the creditor agreed to delete two others from Applicant\u2019s creditor \nreport when the creditor was unable to verity Applicant was the responsible party.  \n \nThe only unaddressed obligation is the van debt. The last action on the vehicle \nrepossession debt occurred in 2001, more than six years ago. It is unlikely this \nobligation could be a source of improper pressure or duress. Of course, the issue is not \nsimply whether all the debts are paid\u2014it is whether his financial circumstances raise \nconcerns about his fitness to hold a security clearance. (See AG & 2(a) (1)) While some \ndebts remain unpaid, their nature is insufficient to raise security concerns. (See AG & \n2(a) (1).) Neither the size of the debt, $12,000, nor the non payment of his ex-wife\u2019s \nobligation makes Applicant a security risk.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant mitigated the security concerns arising from his financial \nconsiderations.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F.:  \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a \u2013 1.i: \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n8\nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

HEINY\nAPPEARANCES\nFOR GOVERNMENT\nRobert E. Coacher, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nSYNOPSIS\nIt was alleged Applicant owed nine creditors approximately $26,000.  Two of the debts are\nthe same obligation. He has paid three of the debts, is negotiating to pay two others, and disputes\nthe remaining four debts.  He was the victim of identity theft. The record evidence is sufficient to\n\nRequired by Executive Order 10865, as amended, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive),\n1\ndated January 2, 1992, as amended.\n2\nmitigate or extenuate the negative security concerns stemming from financial considerations.\nClearance is granted.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn April 10, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement\nof Reasons (SOR) to Applicant stating that DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative\nfinding  it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for\n1\nApplicant. The SOR set forth reasons why a security clearance could not be granted or continued\ndue to financial considerations security concerns.\nOn June 18, 2007, Applicant answered the SOR and requested a hearing. On July 23, 2007,\nI was assigned the case. On August 11, 2007, a Notice of Hearing was issued for the hearing held\non August 29, 2007. At the hearing, the government presented four exhibits (Gov Ex).  Applicant\ntestified and submitted 25 exhibits (App Ex). The record was kept open to allow Applicant to submit\nadditional documents, which were received on September 11, 2007. Department Counsel having no\nobjections, the documents were admitted into evidence as App Ex Z. On September 12, 2007,\nDOHA received the transcript (Tr.).\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nThe SOR alleges security concerns for financial considerations. In his response to the SOR,\nApplicant indicated a number of the debts had been paid and denied nine of the debts indicating they\nresulted from identity theft. The admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a\nthorough review of the entire record, I make the following findings of fact.\nApplicant is a 37-year-old data base developer who has worked for a defense contractor since\nAugust 2005.  He is seeking to obtain a security clearance.\nIn the Summer of 2000, Applicant\u2014then age 30\u2014cosigned a $16,691 automobile loan (App\nEx P) for a female acquaintance. Applicant had known this person for about a year. (Tr. 37) The\ntransaction involved a down payment, which was not paid resulting in the $927 debt listed as SOR\n1.a. The woman who obtained the car then left the area and failed to make the loan payments.  The\nvehicle was repossessed which resulted in a $5,701 debt (SOR 1.i.)  Applicant has tried but has been\nunsuccessful in locating the woman.  \n Applicant made an offer to settle the repossession debt for 40% of the amount due. (Tr. 41)\nThe creditors rejected the offer and Applicant has now offered to settle for 50%.  Once an agreement\nis reached, Applicant will pay this debt. (Tr. 41)\nThe car was purchased at a dealership.  Routinely when a car is purchased the seller provides\nthe purchaser with copies of all paperwork submitted to buy the car.  This would include not only\nthe loan agreement, but all paperwork submitted by Applicant and the other person in order to secure\na loan. \n\nAt the hearing, Applicant stated he was unaware of the fraudulent accounts until 2004. (Tr. 23) \n2\n3\nThe month after cosigning on the car, Applicant returned to school obtaining a bachelor\u2019s\nand master\u2019s of science degree in information systems. (Tr. 43, App Ex A) A year later,  Applicant\n2\nnoticed a number of fraudulent accounts appeared on his credit reports that he had not opened.\nThree of the accounts (SOR 1.c, 1.d, and 1.e) were opened in July 2000.  Applicant reported the\naccounts to the police and disputed the accounts with the credit reporting companies.  The police\nstated they would do what they could, but since the accounts had been opened several years prior,\nlittle could be done to locate the fraudulent party. (Tr.36) When Applicant learned of the fraud, he\nobtained a credit monitoring service. (Gov Ex 2, App Ex Q)\nIn July 2000, a bank credit card account was opened resulting in a $3,212 debt (SOR 1.b).\nThat debt was sold to a collection firm (SOR 1.f).  Another collection firm purchased the debt. (App\nEx T) The current collection firm has offered to settle the matter for $5,415.  Applicant is disputing\nthis debt. A $4,000 debt to an electronic store is alleged in SOR 1.g. The debt was sold to a\ncollection firm and then placed with another collection firm. (App Ex U) Applicant is disputing this\ndebt.\nIn 2004, Applicant began working as a student worker and graduate student making $888\nper month. Applicant\u2019s income for 2004 was $12,400. (App Ex B) He began paying the accounts\nand paid off a number of debts.  He has also paid his $5,486 student loan. He is current on his\nstudent loan repayments, which are automatically debited from his account monthly. (Tr. 29) With\nthe exception of his student loans, Applicant has not incurred any new debts. Applicant\u2019s income\nfor 2005 was $25,247 (App Ex C) and $60,332 for 2006 (App Ex D). Applicant is currently paid $27\nper hour. As of mid-August 2007, his year-to-date income was $35,653. (App Ex E)\nApplicant has more than $14,500 in his checking and savings accounts. (Tr. 30, App Exs F,\nG, H)  In the last four years, Applicant has paid $28,000 to assist his parents. (Tr. 30)  Applicant is\ncurrent on his utility bills and other obligations. (Tr.31, App Exs I, J, K, L, M) Applicant has one\ncredit card, which is current. (App Exs N, O)  Applicant\u2019s August 2007 credit report (App Ex P) lists\nApplicant as \u201cpays as agreed\u201d on numerous accounts.  Applicant owns two lots in a golf course\ncommunity, which he has recently put on the market asking $72,000 for each of the lots. (Tr. 63,\nApp Ex Z)\nA summary of the nine debts listed in the SOR follows:\nCreditor\nAmount \nCurrent Status\n1\na\nDown payment on a\nvehicle.

Disqualifying Conditions (DC) and Mitigating Conditions\n(MC) are set forth for each applicable guideline. Additionally, each decision must be a fair and\nimpartial commonsense decision based upon the relevant and material facts and circumstances, the\nwhole person concept, and the factors listed in Section 6.3 of the Directive. The adjudicative\nguidelines are to be applied by administrative judges on a case-by-case basis with an eye toward\nmaking determinations that are clearly consistent with the interests of national security. The\npresence or absence of a particular condition or factor for or against clearance is not determinative\nof a conclusion for or against an applicant.  However, the adjudicative guidelines should be followed\nwhenever a case can be measured against this policy guidance. Considering the evidence as a whole,\nI conclude the relevant guideline to be applied here is Guideline F, financial considerations.\nBURDEN OF PROOF\nThe sole purpose of a security clearance decision is to decide if it is clearly consistent with\nthe national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for an applicant. Initially, the\nGovernment must establish, by substantial evidence, that conditions exist in the personal or\n\n ISCR Case No. 93-1390 (January 27, 1995) at pp. 7-8; Directive, Enclosure 3, Item E3.1.15\n3\n5\nprofessional history of the applicant which disqualify, or may disqualify, an applicant from being\neligible for access to classified information. The burden of proof in a security clearance case is\nsomething less than a preponderance of evidence, although the government is required to present\nsubstantial evidence to meet its burden of proof.  Substantial evidence is more than a scintilla, but\nless than a preponderance of the evidence. All that is required is proof of facts and circumstances\nwhich indicate an applicant is at risk for mishandling classified information, or that an applicant\ndoes not demonstrate the high degree of judgment, reliability, or trustworthiness required of persons\nhandling classified information.  Additionally, the government must prove controverted facts alleged\nin the SOR.  Once the government has met its burden, the burden shifts to an applicant to present\nevidence to refute, extenuate or mitigate the government's case.  Additionally, an applicant has the\nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.3\nAs noted by the United States Supreme Court in Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518,\n528 (1988), \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d A person who has access to classified\ninformation enters into a fiduciary relationship with the government based on trust and confidence.\nThe government, therefore, has a compelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the\nrequisite judgment, reliability and trustworthiness of one who will protect the national interests. The\n\u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any reasonable doubt\nabout an applicant\u2019s suitability for access to classified information in favor of protecting national\nsecurity.  Security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials. \nCONCLUSIONS\nThe Government has satisfied its initial burden of proof under Guideline F, financial\nconsiderations. A person\u2019s relationship with his creditors is a private matter until evidence is\nuncovered demonstrating an inability or unwillingness to repay debts under agreed upon terms.\nAbsent evidence of strong extenuating or mitigating circumstances, an applicant with a history of\nserious or recurring financial difficulties is in a position of risk that is inconsistent with the holding\nof a security clearance. An applicant is not required to be debt free, but is required to manage his\nfinances so as to meet his financial obligations.\nFinancial considerations become a security concern when a person has significant delinquent\ndebts. An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal or\nunethical acts to generate funds to meet financial obligations. Additionally, an individual who is\nfinancially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, unconcerned, or careless in their obligations to\nprotect classified information.  Behaving responsibly or irresponsibly in one aspect of life provides\nan indication of how a person may behave in other aspects of life. \nApplicant owed approximately $19,000 on past due accounts. Although the SOR alleges nine\ndebts, two of the debts are the same debt, which the creditor offered to settle for $5,400\nDisqualifying Conditions (DC) 19(a) \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts\u201d and 19(c) \u201ca\nhistory of not meeting financial obligations,\u201d apply. \n\n6\nApplicant has paid three payments on the debts (SOR 1.b, 1.e, and 1.h). Mitigating Condition\n(MC) 20(d) \u201cthe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise\nresolve debts,\u201d applies to theses debts.\nMitigating Conditions (MC) 20(a) \u201cthe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent,\nor occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the\nindividual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment,\u201d has some applicability.  During\nthe Summer of 2000, Applicant cosigned on a loan and the car was later repossessed.  It is unlikely\nApplicant will ever cosign on another loan.  Applicant has contacted both creditors related to his\nloan (SOR 1.a and 1.i).  Once the creditor in SOR 1.a ($927) can locate the debt, Applicant is willing\nto pay that debt. Applicant is negotiating a settlement agreement concerning the repossession debt\nlisted in SOR 1.i. ($5,701) Once a settlement has been reached, Applicant is willing to pay this debt.\nShortly after Applicant cosigned the car loan, a number of fraudulent accounts were opened.\nApplicant was unaware of the accounts until years later.  Routinely, when a vehicle is purchased a\ncopy of the paperwork is provided the purchaser.  This would included the financial information\nApplicant submitted as cosigner.  Since this involved a loan, Applicant\u2019s paperwork would have\nrevealed much financial information about Applicant. When aware, he contacted the police, but\nbecause of the passage of time little could be done.  \nApplicant is disputing three debts due to this identity theft. The debt in SOR 1.c and 1.f are\nthe same obligation. MC 20(e) \u201cthe individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of\nthe past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented proof to substantiate\nthe basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions to resolve the issue, \u201capplies.  Applicant\nshould pay his obligations, but is not responsible to pay for fraudulent accounts.  \nThe criminal actions of another is a condition that is beyond Applicant\u2019s control. I find the\nMC 20(b) \u201cthe conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s\ncontrol (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death,\ndivorce or separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances,\u201d to apply.\nAlthough not specifically listed as an example in MC 20(b), Applicant could not control the\nfraudulent actions of another and has acted responsibly once he was made aware of it. \n Applicant is paying his debts as agreed.  His students loan payments are an automatic\ndeduction from his banking account each month. Although employed only since 2004, Applicant\nhas been able to provide his parents with $28,000 in support and accumulate $14,000 in his savings\nand checking accounts.  Additionally, he has two lots which he recently put on the market at $72,000\neach. Applicant has sufficient funds to pay all of the debts listed in the SOR should he be found\nliable for them. There is a clear indication the problem is being resolved or under control.  MC 20(c)\n\u201cthe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear indications\nthat the problem is being resolved or is under control\u201d applies.\nIn reaching my conclusions I have also considered: the nature, extent, and seriousness of the\nconduct; Applicant\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; the circumstances surrounding the\nconduct; Applicant\u2019s voluntary and knowledgeable participation; the motivation for the conduct; the\nfrequency and recency of the conduct; presence or absence of rehabilitation; potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and the probability that the circumstance or conduct will continue\nor recur in the future.  I find for Applicant as to financial considerations.\n\n7\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal Findings as required by Section 3, Paragraph 7, of Enclosure 1 of the Directive are\nhereby rendered as follows:\nParagraph 1 financial considerations: \nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.i:\nFor Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.

FOREMAN\nAPPEARANCES\nFOR GOVERNMENT\nEmilio Jaksetic, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nSYNOPSIS\n\n2\nApplicant fell behind on his debt payments after his income was dramatically reduced in early\n2003.  Although he began working for his current employer in December 2003 and making good\nmoney, he did nothing to resolve his delinquent debts until December 2006.  He started making\nmonthly installment payments on three of the eight delinquent debts alleged in the SOR, but he has\ntaken no action regarding five debts.  Security concerns based on financial considerations are not\nmitigated.  Clearance is denied.\n\n3\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn March 23, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement\nof Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its preliminary decision to deny Applicant a security\nclearance.  This action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information\nwithin Industry (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6,\nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Jan. 2, 1992), as amended and\nmodified (Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) approved by the President on\nDecember 29, 2005, and implemented effective September 1, 2006.  The SOR alleged security\nconcerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations). \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on April 15, 2007, and elected to have the case\ndecided on the written record in lieu of a hearing.  Department Counsel submitted the Government\u2019s\nwritten case on May 24, 2007. A complete copy of the file of relevant material (FORM) was\nprovided to Applicant, who was afforded an opportunity to file objections and submit material to\nrefute, extenuate, or mitigate the disqualifying conditions. Applicant received the FORM on June\n8, 2007, but he did not respond.  The case was assigned to me on August 15, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant's admissions in his answer to the SOR are incorporated into my findings of fact.\nI make the following findings:\nApplicant is a 47-year-old measurement calibration technician employed by a defense\ncontractor since December 2003 (Item 4 at 3).  He previously served on active duty in the U.S. Air\nForce for 20 years, retiring in July 2001 as a technical sergeant (E-6).  He held a security clearance\nfor all of his Air Force career, and he received a top secret SCI clearance in September 1997.\nApplicant was married in March 2001. He has a 14-year-old stepdaughter, a 7-year-old\ndaughter, and a 5-year-old son.  He and his wife separated during the summer of 2006, and he pays\nhis wife child support of $800 per month (Answer to SOR at 2).\nWhen Applicant retired from the Air Force, he was scheduled for an interview with a defense\ncontractor in the U.S.  He also had a backup plan to seek employment with an airline.  Both plans\nwere derailed by the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001.  The defense contractor put plans for\ndeploying a new radar system on hold, and the airlines stopped hiring.\nApplicant was unemployed from July 2001 until September 2001, when he found\nemployment as a field engineer for a crane repair company.  He left this job in May 2002 because\nhis employer began requiring almost continuous travel (Answer to SOR at 1).  He then worked as\nan automotive technician for a luxury car dealer from May 2002 until August 2003, initially at a pay\nrate comparable to his crane repair job.  Because of downturns in the economy and reduced demand\nfor luxury cars, however, his pay as an automotive technician was reduced by about one-third, and\nhe began falling behind on his debt payments.\n\n4\nIn early 2003, Applicant\u2019s wife and family moved to the United Kingdom, her native home.\nApplicant joined them in July 2003, and began working in a low-paying job in an Air Force club.\nAt this point he had stopped making payments on his debts (Answer to SOR at 2).  In December\n2003, he began working for his current employer.  He started work at $11.30 per hour but  is now\nearning $18.55 per hour (Item 7 at 8).  At some time after starting this job, Applicant, his spouse,\nand their three children moved from a two-bedroom home into a three-bedroom home.  The record\ndoes not reflect how much this move increased his housing costs. \nIn December 2006, Applicant began working with a debt counseling agency.  He made\nmonthly payments in December through April 2007 on three of the debts alleged in the SOR.\nBecause he did not respond to the FORM, the record does not reflect whether he has continued to\nmake payments after April.  In January 2007, he executed a personal financial statement in response\nto DOHA interrogatories, which reflected monthly net income of $4,311, expenses of $2,356, and\ndebt payments of $775 (Item 7 at 4).\nApplicant admitted the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b, and denied the allegations in SOR\n\u00b6\u00b6 1.c-1.h. The evidence concerning his delinquent debts is summarized in the table below.\nSOR\nDebt\nAmount\nStatus\nRecord\n1.a\nTelephone\n$667\nPaying $30 \nper month\nItem 3 (Answer to SOR) at\n7-8; Item 8 at 1 (Credit\nreport dated 3-7-07)\n1.b\nUtilities\n$482\nUnpaid\nItem 8 at 1\n1.c\nCredit card\n$8,126\nUnpaid\nItem 8 at 1\n1.d\nCollection account\n$2,309\nUnpaid\nItem 3 at 7-8; Item 8 at 2\n1.e\nCollection account\n$4,095\nPaying $105 \nper month\nItem 3 at 7-8; Item 8 at 2\n1.f\nCollection account\n$14,317\nPaying $300 \nper month\nItem 3 at 7-8; Item 8 at 2\n1.g\nCredit card\n$2,448\nUnpaid\nItem 5 (Credit report dated\n6-25-04) at 3\n1.h\nCharge account \n$2,343\nUnpaid\nItem 5 at 5 \n\n5\nPOLICIES\n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d  Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S.\n518, 528 (1988).  As Commander in Chief, the President has \u201cthe authority to . . . control access to\ninformation bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently\ntrustworthy to occupy a position . . . that will give that person access to such information.\u201d  Id. at\n527.  The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants\neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with\nthe national interest to do so.\u201d  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within\nIndustry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.  Eligibility for a security clearance is\npredicated upon the applicant meeting the criteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines.  Each\nclearance decision must be a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision based on the relevant and\nmaterial facts and circumstances, the whole person concept, the disqualifying conditions and\nmitigating conditions under each specific guideline, and the factors listed in AG \u00b6\u00b6 2(a)(1)-(9).\nA person granted access to classified information enters into a special relationship with the\ngovernment.  The government must be able to have a high degree of trust and confidence in persons\nwith access to classified information.  However, the decision to deny an individual a security\nclearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  See Exec. Or. 10865\n\u00a7 7.  It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the\nSecretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.\nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the personal\nor professional history of the applicant which disqualify, or may disqualify, the applicant from being\neligible for access to classified information.  See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is\n\u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth.,\n36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994).  The guidelines presume a nexus or rational connection between\nproven conduct under any of the criteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability.  See\nISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).  \nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial evidence, the\nburden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts.  See Directive \u00b6\nE3.1.15.  An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with\nthe national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App.\nBd. Dec. 19, 2002).  \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of\ndenials.\u201d  Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b). \nCONCLUSIONS\nGuideline F (Financial Considerations)\nThe concern under this guideline is as follows: \u201cFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s\nmeans, satisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment,\nor unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an\nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. An individual\nwho is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.\u201d  AG\n\u00b618.\n\n6\nThe disqualifying condition in AG \u00b6 19(a) is raised where there is an \u201cinability or\nunwillingness to satisfy debts.\u201d  AG \u00b6 19(c) is raised when there is \u201ca history of not meeting financial\nobligations.\u201d  Applicant\u2019s financial history raises both of these conditions.\nSince the government produced substantial evidence to raise the disqualifying conditions in\nAG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and(c), the burden shifted to Applicant to produce evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate the facts.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating\ncondition, and the burden of disproving it is never shifted to the government.  See ISCR Case No.\n02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \nSecurity concerns based on financial problems can be mitigated by showing that \u201cthe\nbehavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is\nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or\ngood judgment.\u201d  AG \u00b6 20(a).  This is a compound mitigating condition, with three disjunctive\nprongs and one conjunctive prong.  It may be established by showing the conduct was \u201cso long ago,\u201d\nor \u201cso infrequent,\u201d or \u201coccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur.\u201d  If any of the\nthree disjunctive prongs are established, the mitigating condition is not fully established unless the\nconduct \u201cdoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment.\u201d\nApplicant\u2019s financial problems began when his pay as an automotive technician was reduced,\nand they were exacerbated when his family moved back to the U.K. and he followed them, working\nfor several months at low pay.  There is no evidence he experienced previous financial problems.\nHis financial problems are unlikely to recur if he continues working for his current employer.  The\ncircumstances causing his financial distress do not raise doubts about his reliability, trustworthiness,\nor good judgment.  However, his failure to begin resolving his problems until December 2006, three\nyears after he started his current job, raises doubts about his prudence, sense of duty, and good\nfinancial judgment.  I conclude this mitigating condition is not fully established.\nSecurity concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing that \u201cthe conditions\nthat resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of\nemployment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or\nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.\u201d  AG \u00b6 20(b).  Both\nprongs, i.e., conditions beyond the person\u2019s control and responsible conduct, must be established.\nApplicant\u2019s marital problems and unexpected reduction in his pay as an automotive technician were\ncircumstances beyond his control.  He appears to have acted responsibly when the circumstances\noccurred, but he did not act responsibly once his financial situation stabilized, because he waited\nthree more years to begin resolving his financial problems.  I conclude this mitigating condition is\nnot fully established.\nSecurity concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing that \u201cthe person has\nreceived or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear indications that the problem\nis being resolved or is under control.\u201d  AG \u00b6 20(c).  This mitigating condition also has two prongs.\nIf, as in this case, the person has received counseling, it must also be shown that there are clear\nindications the problem is being resolved or under control.  The second prong is not established,\nbecause there is no evidence that the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.c, 1.d, 1.g, and 1.h are being\nresolved.\n\n7\nSecurity concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing that \u201cthe individual\ninitiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.\u201d  AG \u00b6 20(d).  The\nconcept of good faith \u201crequires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness,\nprudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 99-0201, 1999 WL\n1442346 at *4 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 1999).  Evidence of past irresponsibility is not mitigated by\npayment of debts only under pressure of qualifying for a security clearance.  Applicant waited three\nyears to begin repaying his delinquent debts, after he realized his security clearance was in jeopardy.\nHis debt repayment plan appears to cover only three of the eight debts alleged in the SOR.  I\nconclude this mitigating condition is not established.\nThe Whole Person\nIn addition to considering the specific disqualifying and mitigating conditions under each\nguideline, I have also considered: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency\nand recency of the conduct; (4) the applicant\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the\nextent to which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  AG \u00b6\u00b6\n2(a)(1)-(9).  Several of these factors are incorporated in the above discussion of Guideline F, but\nsome merit additional comment.\nApplicant is a mature adult.  He served honorably for 20 years in the Air Force, and he held\nclearances during all of his Air Force service, apparently without incident.  His financial downturn\nwas unfortunate and not entirely in his control.  However, his failure to address his financial\nproblems for three years after returning to gainful employment raises doubts about his sense of duty,\njudgment, and reliability.  He has not yet established a track record of systematic payments on his\ndelinquent debts.\nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline F, and evaluating\nall the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the\nsecurity concerns based on financial considerations.  Accordingly, I conclude he has not carried his\nburden of showing that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to continue his security\nclearance.\n\n8\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nThe following are my conclusions as to each allegation in the SOR:\nParagraph 1.  Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h:\nAgainst Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all of the circumstances in this case, it is not clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to continue Applicant\u2019s security clearance.

FOREMAN\nAPPEARANCES\nFOR GOVERNMENT\nStephanie C. Hess, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro se\n\n2\nSYNOPSIS\nApplicant was born in Taiwan of Taiwanese parents.  She came to the U.S. with her family\nabout 10 years ago, when she was 15 years old.  She completed high school, college, and graduate\nschool in the U.S.  She is engaged to a native-born U.S. citizen.  She surrendered her Taiwanese\npassport when she learned it raised security issues, and she has stated her willingness to renounce\nher Taiwanese citizenship.  Her parents are permanent U.S. residents, but they have temporarily\nreturned to Taiwan to care for an elderly parent.  They intend to live permanently in the U.S. as soon\nas they are no longer needed in Taiwan.  Applicant has mitigated the security concerns based on\nforeign preference and foreign influence.  Clearance is granted.\n\n3\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn November 16, 2006, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its preliminary decision to deny Applicant a\nsecurity clearance.  This action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified\nInformation within Industry (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified, Department of Defense\nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Jan. 2, 1992),\nas amended and modified (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines approved by the\nPresident on December 29, 2005, and implemented by the Department of Defense on August 30,\n2006 (Guidelines).  The SOR alleged security concerns raised under Guideline C (Foreign\nPreference) and Guideline B (Foreign Influence).\nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on December 11, 2006, and elected to have a hearing\nbefore an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on February 21, 2007, and heard on\nMarch 13, 2007, as scheduled.  DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on March 23, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant's admissions in her answer to the SOR and at the hearing are incorporated into my\nfindings of fact.  I make the following findings:\nApplicant is a 25-year-old graduate research assistant at a university, working on federal\nresearch contracts.  She was born in Taiwan, Republic of China, and came to the U.S. with her\nfamily when she was 15 years old.  She attended high school, college, and graduate school in the\nU.S.  She holds bachelor\u2019s and master\u2019s degrees in computer science (Tr. 5).  She became a U.S.\ncitizen in July 2002.  She has never held a security clearance.\nApplicant\u2019s parents are citizens of Taiwan, temporarily residing in Taiwan.  They immigrated\nto the U.S. in 1996 and have become permanent U.S. residents.  They retired while Applicant was\nin high school, bought a home in the U.S., and lived with Applicant while she attended high school\n(Tr. 50).  Applicant\u2019s father owned a medical supply company until he retired, and her mother\nworked for the telephone company (Tr. 61).  When her mother retired, she received her pension in\na lump sum (Tr. 62).  They have no connections to the government of Taiwan.  They are financially\nsecure, live on their savings, and do not depend on the government of Taiwan for any benefits.  They\nhave no business ties in Taiwan (Tr. 50).  \nApplicant\u2019s parents returned to Taiwan in 1999 (Tr. 59) to care for aging parents, of which\nonly one is still living.  It was a difficult decision for her parents to return to Taiwan (Tr. 60).  They\nintend to return to the U.S. when they are no longer needed to care for the sole surviving parent (Tr.\n51). One of Applicant\u2019s grandfathers was a doctor and the other was a merchant.  Both grandmothers\nwere housewives (Tr. 65).\nApplicant\u2019s aunt and two uncles live in the U.S.  She also has one aunt in Taiwan, with\nwhom she has no contact (Tr. 64-65).\n\n4\nApplicant holds dual U.S.-Taiwanese citizenship by virtue of being born in Taiwan of\nTaiwanese parents (Tr. 48).  She stated in her answer to the SOR and at the hearing that she is\nwilling to renounce her Taiwanese citizenship (Tr. 48).  She testified that the U.S. is her home and\nher \u201conly country,\u201d where she plans to live for the rest of her life (Tr. 55).  She has not yet formally\nrenounced her Taiwanese citizenship, because it requires that she gather a number of documents and\npersonally appear before a government official in Taiwan (Tr. 56-57).\nBetween June 1998 and December 2004, while she was a student, Applicant traveled to\nTaiwan during school breaks to visit her parents and to visit other countries in the Far East.  Now\nthat she is employed full-time and engaged to be married, she spends her free time in the U.S. with\nher fiance (Tr. 52).  She traveled to Taiwan once since completing her education, accompanied by\nher fiance, to have professional wedding phonographs taken in accordance with Taiwanese custom\n(Tr. 52).  Although Applicant and her fiance traveled to Taiwan for the traditional formal wedding\nphotographs, they intend to be married in the U.S., contrary to Taiwanese tradition.  Applicant\u2019s\nparents intend to come to the U.S. for the wedding (Tr. 62-63).\nApplicant\u2019s Taiwanese passport was renewed in December 2001, before she became a U.S.\ncitizen.  She used her Taiwanese passport until December 2003, even after she became a U.S. citizen.\nShe was a student on limited income and used her Taiwanese passport to avoid the cost of obtaining\na visa (Tr. 49).  However, when she learned her possession and use of a Taiwanese passport raised\nsecurity concerns, she surrendered it (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit (AX) A; Tr. 49).\nApplicant traveled to the Peoples Republic of China (PRC) in May 2006 with her fiance, a\nU.S. citizen who works for the same employer, when he was invited to participate in an international\nsoftware conference.  Her fiance does not speak Chinese, and she accompanied him to be his\ntranslator, because she \u201cdoesn\u2019t trust those Chinese at all\u201d (Tr. 52).  She regards the Chinese as\nunfriendly and hostile to all foreigners. Even though she speaks fluent Chinese, they regarded her\nas foreign because of her different accent (Tr. 66).  In accordance with their employer\u2019s policy on\nforeign travel, they both reported their planned travel to China beforehand and filed debriefing\nreports afterwards (AX B and C; Tr. 53).  Applicant\u2019s debriefing report reflects that no incidents or\nforeign contacts of security interest occurred during the trip.\nApplicant\u2019s supervisor for the past nine months testified on her behalf.  He testified that she\nhas been entrusted with sensitive, non-classified materials and has done a \u201cgreat job.\u201d  He regards\nher as loyal and hard working (Tr. 70-71).  She has done nothing to cause him to doubt her loyalty\nor reliability (Tr. 73).\nApplicant\u2019s fiance testified he has known her since 1999, when they both started college (Tr.\n76).  He is now a Ph.D. candidate.  He and his professor attended a \u201chighly prestigious\u201d international\nsoftware engineering conference in China, and Applicant accompanied him to be his translator (Tr.\n77).  He testified Applicant is very independent and very trustworthy.  He was with Applicant when\nshe obtained her U.S. citizenship, and he described it as a very happy occasion because she could\nnow feel \u201clike she really belonged here and she had her freedom.\u201d (Tr. 79.)\nI granted Department Counsel\u2019s request to take administrative notice of adjudicative facts\nabout Taiwan and the PRC (Tr 40).  The request, including the 12 enclosures documenting the facts\nto be noticed, is incorporated in the record as Hearing Exhibit I.  At my direction, Department\n\n5\nCounsel submitted one additional document after the hearing to update the basis for administrative\nnotice.  The additional document is included in the record as Hearing Exhibit II.\nTaiwan is a multiparty democracy, established as a separate, independent government by\nrefugees from mainland China in 1949.  The People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) does not recognize\nTaiwan\u2019s independence and insists there is only one China.  The U.S. recognized Taiwan as an\nindependent government until January 1979, when it formally recognized the PRC government as\nthe sole legal government of China.  Taiwan maintains a large military establishment to protect itself\nfrom the PRC.  It is an active collector of U.S. economic intelligence.\nThe PRC has an authoritarian government dominated by the Communist Party.  It has a poor\nhuman rights record.  It has large and increasingly sophisticated military forces.  The U.S. and the\nPRC have been rivals since the Cold War, with particular disagreement on the status of Taiwan.\nDespite political disagreements, the U.S. and the PRC have become major economic and trading\npartners.  The PRC aggressively targets sensitive and protected U.S. technology and military\ninformation, using worldwide intelligence operations, including those in Taiwan.  U.S. citizens of\nChinese ancestry are considered prime intelligence targets.  Travelers to the PRC can expect to be\nplaced under surveillance, with their hotel rooms, telephones, and fax machines monitored and\npersonal possessions, including computers, searched without their knowledge or consent.\nPOLICIES\n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d  Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S.\n518, 528 (1988).  As Commander in Chief, the President has \u201cthe authority to . . . control access to\ninformation bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently\ntrustworthy to occupy a position . . . that will give that person access to such information.\u201d  Id. at\n527.  The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants\neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with\nthe national interest to do so.\u201d  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within\nIndustry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.  Eligibility for a security clearance is\npredicated upon the applicant meeting the criteria contained in the Guidelines.  Each clearance\ndecision must be a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision based on the relevant and material\nfacts and circumstances, the whole person concept, the disqualifying conditions and mitigating\nconditions under each specific guideline, and the factors listed in the Guidelines \u00b6\u00b6 2(a)(1)-(9).\nA person granted access to classified information enters into a special relationship with the\ngovernment.  The government must be able to have a high degree of trust and confidence in persons\nwith access to classified information.  However, the decision to deny an individual a security\nclearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  See Exec. Or. 10865\n\u00a7 7.  It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the\nSecretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.\nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the personal\nor professional history of the applicant which disqualify, or may disqualify, the applicant from being\neligible for access to classified information.  See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is\n\u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth.,\n\n6\n36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994).  The Guidelines presume a nexus or rational connection between\nproven conduct under any of the criteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability.  See\nISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).  \nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial evidence, the\nburden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts.  See Directive \u00b6\nE3.1.15.  An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with\nthe national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App.\nBd. Dec. 19, 2002).  \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of\ndenials.\u201d  Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see Guidelines \u00b6 2(b). \nCONCLUSIONS\nGuideline C (Foreign Preference)\nThe concern under this guideline is as follows: \u201cWhen an individual acts in such a way as\nto indicate a preference for a foreign country over the United States, then he or she may be prone to\nprovide information or make decisions that are harmful to the interests of the United States.\u201d\nGuidelines \u00b6 9.  A disqualifying condition may arise from \u201cexercise of any right, privilege or\nobligation of foreign citizenship after becoming a U.S. citizen or through the foreign citizenship of\na family member,\u201d including but not limited to \u201cpossession of a current foreign passport.\u201d\nGuidelines \u00b6 10(a)(1).  This disqualifying condition was raised by Applicant\u2019s possession and use\nof a Taiwanese passport.\nSince the government produced substantial evidence to raise the disqualifying condition in\nGuideline \u00b610(a)(1), the burden shifted to Applicant to produce evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate the facts.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  Applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating\ncondition, and the burden of disproving it is never shifted to the government.  See ISCR Case No.\n02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \nSecurity concerns under this guideline may be mitigated by evidence that \u201cdual citizenship\nis based solely on parents\u2019 citizenship or birth in a foreign country.\u201d  Guidelines \u00b6 11(a).  Applicant\ndid not actively seek Taiwanese citizenship, but holds it solely because she was born in Taiwan of\nTaiwanese parents.  She applied for and received U.S. citizenship in 2002.  I conclude this mitigating\ncondition is established.  \nSecurity concerns under this guideline also may be mitigated by if \u201cthe individual has\nexpressed a willingness to renounce dual citizenship.\u201d  Guidelines \u00b6 11(b).  This mitigating condition\nis established because Applicant expressed her willingness to renounce her Taiwanese citizenship\nin her answer to the SOR and again at the hearing.\nSecurity concerns may be mitigated by showing that \u201cexercise of the rights, privileges, or\nobligations of foreign citizenship occurred before the individual became a U.S. citizen or when the\nindividual was a minor.\u201d  Guidelines \u00b6 11(c).  This mitigating condition is only partly established.\nApplicant used her Taiwanese passport several times before becoming a U.S. citizen, but she\n\n7\ncontinued to use it until December 2003, even though her 21  birthday was in June 2002 and she\nst\nbecame a U.S. citizen in July 2002.\nFinally, security concerns based on possession or use of a foreign passport may be mitigated\nif \u201cthe passport has been destroyed, surrendered to the cognizant security authority, or otherwise\ninvalidated.\u201d  Guidelines \u00b6 11(e). This mitigating condition was established by Applicant\u2019s surrender\nof her Taiwanese passport.\nGuideline B (Foreign Influence)\nThe concern under this guideline is as follows: \u201cForeign contacts and interests may be a\nsecurity concern if the individual has divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be\nmanipulated or induced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way that\nis not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Adjudication\nunder this Guideline can and should consider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign\ncontact or financial interest is located, including, but not limited to, such considerations as whether\nthe foreign country is known to target United States citizens to obtain protected information and/or\nis associated with a risk of terrorism.\u201d  Guidelines \u00b6 6.\nA disqualifying condition under this guideline may be raised by \u201ccontact with a foreign\nfamily member, business or professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or\nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation,\ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion.\u201d  Guidelines \u00b6 7(a).  A disqualifying condition also\nmay be raised by \u201cconnections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that create a\npotential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation to protect sensitive information or\ntechnology and the individual's desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing that\ninformation.\u201d  Guidelines \u00b6 7(b).\nBoth disqualifying conditions are raised in this case.  By residing in Taiwan, Applicant\u2019s\nparents have created a heightened risk of exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or\ncoercion by governmental and non-governmental agents acting on behalf of the Taiwanese\ngovernment, PRC government, or non-governmental business agents in Taiwan or the PRC.  Thus,\nthe disqualifying condition in Guidelines \u00b6 7(a) is raised.  Furthermore, Applicant remains close to\nher parents, and a potential conflict of interest may be raised by Applicant\u2019s desire to protect her\nparents or relieve them from exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion by\nproviding them or foreign agents with sensitive information or technology.  Thus, the disqualifying\ncondition in Guidelines \u00b6 7(b) is also raised.\nSecurity concerns under this guideline may be mitigated by showing that \u201cthe nature of the\nrelationships with foreign persons, the country in which these persons are located, or the positions\nor activities of those persons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed\nin a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, group, organization,\nor government and the interests of the U.S.\u201d  Guidelines \u00b6 8(a).  The totality of an applicant\u2019s family\nties to a foreign country as well as each individual family tie must be considered.  ISCR Case No.\n01-22693 at 7 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2003). \n\n8\nGuideline B is not limited to countries hostile to the United States.  \u201cThe United States has\na compelling interest in protecting and safeguarding classified information from any person,\norganization, or country that is not authorized to have access to it, regardless of whether that person,\norganization, or country has interests inimical to those of the United States.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 02-\n11570 at 5 (App. Bd. May 19, 2004). \nFurthermore, friendly nations can have profound disagreements with the United States over\nmatters they view as important to their vital interests or national security. Finally, we know friendly\nnations have engaged in espionage against the United States, especially in the economic, scientific,\nand technical fields.  See ISCR Case No. 00-0317, 2002 DOHA LEXIS 83 at **15-16 (App. Bd.\nMar. 29, 2002).  Nevertheless, the nature of a nation\u2019s government, its relationship with the U.S.,\nand its human rights record are relevant in assessing the likelihood that an applicant\u2019s family\nmembers are vulnerable to government coercion. The risk of coercion, persuasion, or duress is\nsignificantly greater if the foreign country has an authoritarian government, a family member is\nassociated with or dependent upon the government, or the country is known to conduct intelligence\noperations against the U.S.\nTaiwan is a democracy with close ties to the U.S.  It is unlikely it would risk damaging its\nrelationship with the U.S. by exploiting or threatening its private citizens in order to force a U.S.\ncitizen to betray the U.S.  Neither of Applicant\u2019s parents worked in a high-technology or scientific\nbusiness.  They have no connections with the Taiwanese government and no business connections\nthat would make them amenable to participating in industrial espionage.   Her parents returned to\nTaiwan out of family necessity, not choice.  They are financially independent.  Their loyalties and\nmany family ties are in the U.S.  \nApplicant\u2019s parents do not live under the control of the repressive PRC government.\nAlthough they are vulnerable to efforts by PRC agents operating in Taiwan to exploit them, their\nvulnerability in Taiwan is not appreciably different than it would be in the U.S.  I conclude the\nmitigating condition in Guideline \u00b6 8(a) is established.\nSecurity concerns under this guideline also may be mitigated by show that \u201cthere is no\nconflict of interest, either because the individual's sense of loyalty or obligation to the foreign person,\ngroup, government, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding\nrelationships and loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any conflict of\ninterest in favor of the U.S. interest.\u201d  Guidelines \u00b6 8(b).  Applicant has deep loyalty and a sense of\nobligation to her parents, but she is also fiercely independent.  Both she and her parents have only\nminimal loyalty to Taiwan and no loyalty whatsoever to the PRC.  Applicant\u2019s future is in the U.S.\nwith her U.S.-born fiance.  She was educated in the U.S., has strong loyalty to the U.S., and has\nlongstanding family connections in the U.S.  I conclude this mitigating condition is established.\nApplicant\u2019s travel to Taiwan was a manifestation of her devotion to her parents, but it has\nno other independent security significance.  Her travel to the PRC was solely in connection with her\nfiance\u2019s employment.  No incidents of security significance occurred during this trip.  Security\nconcerns based on foreign contacts can be mitigated by evidence that \u201cthe individual has promptly\ncomplied with existing agency requirements regarding the reporting of contacts, requests, or threats\nfrom persons, groups, or organizations from a foreign country.\u201d  Guidelines \u00b6 8(e).  Applicant and\n\n9\nher fiance complied with their employer\u2019s reporting and debriefing requirements, thereby\nestablishing this mitigating condition.\nWhole Person Analysis\nIn addition to considering the specific disqualifying and mitigating conditions under each\nguideline, I have also considered: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency\nand recency of the conduct; (4) the applicant\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the\nextent to which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  Guidelines\n\u00b6\u00b6 2(a)(1)-(9).  Many of these factors are incorporated in the above discussions of Guidelines B and\nC, but some merit additional comment.\nApplicant grew from adolescence to adulthood in the U.S.  She is fiercely independent and\nhas strong emotional ties to the U.S.  She was articulate, sincere, and very credible during the\nhearing.  She has done everything reasonably possible to demonstrate her sincerity and reliability.\nShe has demonstrated that both she and her parents would strongly resist any effort by Taiwanese\nor PRC operatives to exploit or influence her.\nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guidelines C and B, and\nevaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has mitigated\nthe security concerns based on foreign preference and foreign influence.  Accordingly, I conclude\nshe has carried her burden of showing that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant\nher a security clearance.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nThe following are my conclusions as to each allegation in the SOR:\nParagraph 1. Guideline C:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\n\n10\nParagraph 2. Guideline B:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.c:\nFor Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all of the circumstances in this case, it is clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant Applicant a security clearance.  Clearance is granted.\nLeRoy F. Foreman\nAdministrative Judge\n",

On October 24, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under Guidelines\nJ and E for Applicant. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865,\nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended;\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised\nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and\neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on November 9, 2007, and elected\nto have his case decided on the record in lieu of a hearing. Department Counsel\nsubmitted the Government\u2019s written case on September 25, 2007. Applicant received a\ncomplete file of relevant material (FORM) on January 28, 2008, and was provided the\nopportunity to file objections and submit material to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the\nMarch 28, 2008\n\nThe Government submitted six items in support of its contentions.\n1\nItem 3 (Applicant\u2019s answer to SOR).\n2\nItem 4 (Security Clearance Questionnaire, dated August 18, 2005).\n3\nId.\n4\nItem 5 (Discharge Form, dated May 12, 2004).\n5\nItem 6 (U.S. Coast Guard Memorandum with attachments, dated March 12, 2004).\n6\n2\nGovernment\u2019s case.  Applicant did not submit additional information. The case was\n1\nassigned to me on March 6, 2008. Based upon a review of the case file, eligibility for\naccess to classified information is denied.\nFindings of Fact\nIn his Answer to the SOR, dated November 9, 2007 and resigned December 21,\n2007, Applicant admitted the factual allegation in \u00b6 1.a of the SOR. He also admitted the\nfactual allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 2.a-c of the SOR.  He did not provide additional information to\n2\nsupport his request for eligibility for a security clearance. \nApplicant is a 26-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He attended college\nfrom 2002 to the present. He is single. He has worked for his current employer since\nDecember 2004.3\nApplicant served in the U.S. Coast Guard (active duty) from July 1999 until May\n2004.  He was administratively discharged due to his unsatisfactory performance. .\n4\n5\nDuring Applicant\u2019s military service he received 15 citations for failure to conform to\nmilitary rules. He disclosed the incidents in his security application. Applicant claimed a\nconflict of interest with the commanding office for each of the incidents listed on the\nsecurity application. He provided no additional information after receiving the FORM.\nIn 2002, Applicant failed to monitor a critical alarm status while on watch. He also\nsigned the day\u2019s log indicating that he had performed proper security rounds. He, in\nfact, did not.  He was counseled and instructed on proper watch procedures. He was\n6\ngiven opportunities to retrain. He was warned that future incidents could result in\ndisciplinary actions. \nApplicant was placed on probation in September 2003 for his failure to conform\nto military rules and his inability to stand a proper watch. During the probation, he\nreceived 15 instances of failing to conform and four instances of improper watch\nstanding.\n\nItem 6 at 1.\n7\n3\nApplicant was awarded Non Judicial Punishment on three occasions. He was\ncounseled and reduced in rank in 2004. His unsatisfactory performance continued. He\nwas less than honest concerning his actions on and off duty.7\nHis commanding officer reported that Applicant was unable to hold himself\naccountable for his actions and had an established history of shirking his responsibility. \nOn or about October 10, 2004 Applicant failed to stop for an accident. He was\ncharged with (1) Hit and Run Driving (2) Trespass-Refuse to Leave and (3), Failure to\nReport an Accident. He was found guilty of the charges under counts two and three. \nHe was fined and ordered to complete 80 hours of community service. He was put on a\nthree year supervised probation. The probation was scheduled to end on January 3,\n2008.  \nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2,\nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the\n\u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, reliable\ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a\ndecision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \n\n4\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Criminal Conduct is set out in\nAG & 30:      \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and\ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability\nor willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nAG & 31(a), an Asingle serious crime or multiple lesser offenses@ may be potentially\ndisqualifying.  Similarly under AG & 131(c), Aan allegation or admission of criminal\nconduct, regardless of whether the person was formally charged, formally prosecuted or\nconvicted@ may raise security concerns. As noted above, Applicant admits he committed\na crime in October 2004 when he failed to report an accident. His probation was just\nscheduled to end in January 2008. These facts are sufficient to raise these potentially\ndisqualifying conditions, requiring a closer examination.\nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security\nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG \u00b6 32(a), the disqualifying condition\nmay be mitigated where Aso much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior\nhappened, or it happened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur\nand does not cast doubt on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment.@ Applicant=s criminal conduct shows a pattern of unlawful behavior continuing\nuntil very recently. His supervised probation has recently ended. It is premature to know\nif this behavior will not recur. It shows poor judgment given his record. This potentially\nmitigating condition does not apply. \n\n5\nUnder AG & 30(d), it may be mitigating where A there is evidence of successful\nrehabilitation; including, but not limited to the passage of time without recurrence of\ncriminal activity, remorse or restitution, job training or higher education, good\nemployment record, or constructive community involvement.\u201d As noted above, Applicant\njust completed probation. He provided no additional information to consider for\nmitigation. I find this potentially mitigating condition is not a factor for consideration in\nthis case. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in\nAG \u00b6 15:\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions about an\nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. Of\nspecial interest is any failure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nAG \u00b6 16(c), \u201ccredible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is not\nsufficient for an adverse determination under any other single guideline, but which,\nwhen considered as a whole, supports a whole-person assessment of questionable\njudgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with\nrules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the person may not\nproperly safeguard protected information.\u201d Applicant was administratively discharged\nfrom the Coast Guard due to a history of unsatisfactory performance. He was cited\nnumerous times for failing to conform to military rules. Despite warnings and a\nprobation, he continued to show unwillingness to comply with the regulations.        \nSimilarly, AG \u00b6 16(d) provides that \u201ccredible adverse information that is not\nexplicitly covered under any other guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an\nadverse determination, but which, when combined with all available information\nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness,\nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other\ncharacteristics indicating that he person may not properly safeguard protected\ninformation. This includes but is not limited to consideration of . .. . (3) a pattern of\ndishonesty or rule violations; and,\nAG \u00b6 16(e) \u201cpersonal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s\nconduct that creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation or duress, such as (1)\nengaging in activities which, if known, may affect the person\u2019s personal, professional, or\ncommunity standing\u201d\nApplicant\u2019s record is replete with rule violations and Non Judicial Punishments\nthroughout his career in the Coast Guard. He was considered to be less than honest in\nresponding to several incidents. He did not take responsibility for his actions. He\n\n6\nreported the incidents were due to a conflict of interest with his commanding officer. He\nsubmitted a false statement in his log. He consistently showed poor judgment and\nquestionable judgment.\nParagraph 17 lists conditions that could mitigate security concerns. Specifically, \u00b6\n17(c) \u201cthe offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is so\ninfrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is unlikely to recur\nand does not case doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgement\u201d does not apply in this case. Moreover, \u00b617(d) \u201cthe individual has\nacknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling to change the behavior or taken\nother positive steps to alleviate the stressors, circumstances or factors that caused\nuntrustworthy, unreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely\nto recur\u201d does not apply. Applicant was warned and given probation and still did not\nperform or comply with the rules and regulations. \nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which\nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for\npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or\nrecurrence.\u201d Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility\nfor a security clearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon\ncareful consideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant served in the U.S. Coast\nGuard from 1999 until his administrative discharge in 2004 for unsatisfactory\nperformance. He had numerous rule violations and did not successfully complete a\n2003 probation. He did not accept responsibility for his actions during his military\nservice. He believed everything was a conflict of interest with his commanding officer.\nDespite numerous opportunities to modify his behavior, he continued to exhibit poor\njudgment. After leaving the military, Applicant was involved in a serious crime. He just\ncompleted his probation. He has not met his burden of proof in this case to overcome\nthe government\u2019s case. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I\nconclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns arising from his personal\nconduct and criminal conduct. \n\n7\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline J:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline E:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a-c:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n                                              \n_________________\nNOREEN A. LYNCH\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On March 12, 2007, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of\n\nThe Judge found in favor of Applicant under Guideline F.  That favorable finding is not at issue on appeal.\n1\n2\nthe basis for that decision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations),\nGuideline E (Personal Conduct) and Guideline J (Criminal Conduct) of Department of Defense\nDirective 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.  On August\n30, 2007, after the hearing, Administrative Judge Martin H. Mogul denied Applicant\u2019s request for\na security clearance.  Applicant timely appealed pursuant to the Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge erred in his findings;\nwhether the Judge erred in concluding Applicant\u2019s falsification of his security clearance application\nwas deliberate; whether the Judge erred by concluding that the security concerns raised under\nGuidelines E and J had not been mitigated.1\n(1) Applicant asserts that the Judge erred in findings that Applicant had served in the U.S.\nNavy from 1980 through 1986 and had resigned when his shoulder was broken, when in fact\nApplicant had served from 1980 to 1997 and had medically retired because of the injury.  Applicant\nhas not met his burden of demonstrating that the Judge\u2019s material findings with respect to\nApplicant\u2019s conduct of security concern do not reflect a reasonable or plausible interpretation of the\nrecord evidence.  \nThe Board\u2019s review of a Judge\u2019s findings is limited to determining if they are supported by\nsubstantial evidence\u2014such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to\nsupport such a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the record.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1.\n\u201cThis is something less than the weight of the evidence, and the possibility of drawing two\ninconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent an administrative agency\u2019s finding from\nbeing supported by substantial evidence.\u201d Consolo v. Federal Maritime Comm\u2019n, 383 U.S. 607, 620,\n(1966).  In this instance, even if the challenged finding was changed to reflect Applicant\u2019s\ninterpretation of the record evidence, it would not have undermined the Judge\u2019s conclusions.\nTherefore, any such error would be at most harmless.  See ISCR Case No. 05-08459 at 2, n.1 (App.\nBd. Nov. 16, 2006).  Considering the record as a whole, the Judge\u2019s material findings with respect\nto Applicant\u2019s conduct of security concern reflect a reasonable interpretation of the record evidence\nand are supported by substantial evidence.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 03-21933 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug.\n18, 2006).\n(2) Applicant also contends that he did not deliberately falsify his security clearance\napplication by failing to disclose unfavorable information of security concern in response to four\ndifferent questions.  In support of this contention, he argues that the omission of the information was\ndue to a misreading of the questions or a lack of information on his part.  Applicant has not\ndemonstrated that the Judge erred.\nThe Judge had the opportunity to consider Applicant\u2019s explanation for why he failed to\ndisclose the information in question.  The Judge was not bound, as a matter of law, to accept or reject\nApplicant\u2019s explanation.  The Judge considered Applicant\u2019s explanation in light of the record\nevidence as a whole, and concluded there was a sufficient basis to find that Applicant\u2019s omissions\nwere deliberate and intentional.  On this record, the Judge\u2019s findings of deliberate falsification are\nsustainable.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1; ISCR Case No. 04-03849 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Jan. 26, 2006).\n \n\n3\n(3) Finally, Applicant contends that the Judge erred in concluding that the security concerns\nraised by his falsifications had not been mitigated, based upon the favorable record evidence,\nparticularly his lengthy, honorable military service.  Again, Applicant has not demonstrated that the\nJudge erred.\nOnce there has been a concern articulated regarding an applicant\u2019s security clearance\neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of a security clearance.\nSee Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9  Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991).\nth\nAfter the government presents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the applicant\nto establish mitigation.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  The presence of some mitigating evidence does not\nalone compel the Judge to make a favorable security clearance decision.  As the trier of fact, the\nJudge has to weigh the evidence as a whole and decide whether the favorable evidence outweighs\nthe unfavorable evidence, or vice versa. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-17691 at 3 (App. Bd. Jul.19,\n2003).  An applicant\u2019s disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, or an ability to argue\nfor a different interpretation of the evidence, is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed the\nevidence or reached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.\nIn this case, the Judge weighed the mitigating evidence offered by Applicant against the\nrecency and seriousness of the disqualifying conduct, and considered the possible application of\nrelevant mitigating conditions and whole person factors.  The Judge found in favor of Applicant\nunder Guideline F.  However, the Judge reasonably explained why the evidence which the Applicant\nhad presented in mitigation was insufficient to overcome the government\u2019s other security concerns.\nThe Board does not review a case de novo.  The favorable record evidence cited by Applicant is not\nsufficient to demonstrate the Judge\u2019s decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.

He has taken action to contact\nthe creditors and pay off his debts, and he has reduced his overdue debt significantly. However,\nApplicant\u2019s credibility is suspect since the financial information that Applicant  provided to the\nGovernment on a Security Clearance Application (SCA) that he completed, regarding his overdue\ndebts, was materially and wilfully incorrect.  Mitigation has not been shown. Clearance is denied.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn March 12, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to\nExecutive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2,\n1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant which detailed reasons why DOHA could\nnot make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant and recommended referral\nto an Administrative Judge to determine whether clearance should be denied or revoked.\nIn a signed and sworn statement, dated May 21, 2007, Applicant responded in writing to the\nSOR allegations (RSOR).  He requested a clearance decision based on a hearing record.\nThe case was assigned to this Administrative Judge on June 22, 2007. A Notice of Hearing\nwas issued to the parties on August 6, 2007, and the hearing was held on August 16, 2007. \nAt the hearing, Department Counsel offered eight documentary exhibits (Exhibits 1-8) and\nno witnesses were called. Applicant appeared without counsel, submitted no documentary exhibits,\nand offered his own testimony. The record was left open until August 23, 2007, to allow  Applicant\nthe opportunity to offer additional documentary exhibits regarding his alleged payment of debts,\nevaluations either from his civilian or military employment,  and character letters. Applicant offered\none timely document, a character letter,  which has been marked as Exhibit A. This exhibit was not\nobjected to by Department Counsel and has been entered into evidence.  The transcript (Tr) was\nreceived on August 24, 2007. \nFINDINGS OF FACT\nIn the SOR, the Government alleges that a security risk may exist under Adjudicative\nGuideline F (Financial Considerations), Guideline E (Personal Conduct), and Guideline J (Criminal\nConduct) of the Directive. The SOR contains nineteen allegations, 1.a. through 1.s., under Guideline\nF, four allegations, 2.a. through 2.d., under Guideline E, and one allegation 3.a., under Guideline J.\nOn his RSOR, Applicant admitted all of the debts listed under SOR allegations  1.c., 1.d., 1.f., 1.g.,\n1.h., 1.i., 1.j., 1.k., 1.l., 1.m., 1.n., 1.o., 1.p., 1.q., 1.r., and 1.s., with some explanations that he had\npaid some of these debts, and he denied the other allegations of debts under Guideline F. Applicant\nalso admitted allegations 2.a., 2.c., and 2.d., and he denied 2.b. He gave no response to 3.a. The\nadmitted allegations are incorporated herein as Findings of Fact. \n\n3\nAfter a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, including Applicant's\nAnswer to the SOR and the admitted documents, and upon due consideration of that evidence, I\nmake the following additional Findings of Fact: \nApplicant is 47 years old. He is unmarried and has two adult daughters. His third daughter\ndied in a 1995 house fire. He served in the United States Navy from 1980 through 1986, and resigned\nwhen he broke his shoulder and was unable to perform his duties aboard his ship. He received an\nHonorable Discharge. Applicant is employed by a defense contractor, and he seeks to retain a DoD\nsecurity clearance in connection with his employment in the defense sector.\nParagraph 1 (Guideline F - Financial Considerations)\nThe SOR lists nineteen debts that Applicant owed as of January 8, 2007, 1.a. through 1.s\nunder Adjudicative Guideline F.  The debts will be discussed in the order that they were listed in the\nSOR: \n1.a. This overdue debt to Creditor 1 is listed in the SOR in the amount of $4,372. This debt\nis alleged to be for a judgement entered against Applicant\u2019s on December 1, 1998, which resulted\nin a garnishment order against him in the amount of $6,565.27. Applicant testified that he paid this\ndebt sometime in 1995. He also contended that no garnishment was ever placed against him, nor was\nhe aware of any judgement against him. Applicant testified that he had no evidence to establish\nevidence of payment of this debt, as the 1995 house fire destroyed many of his records. \n1.b. This overdue debt to Creditor 2 is in the amount of $893. Applicant claimed that he did\nnot recognize this debt, nor has he been able to get verification of its origin.  He has made no\npayment on this debt.\n1.c. This overdue debt to Creditor 3 is in the amount of $122. Applicant testified that this\ndebt has been paid. Exhibit 8, a credit report, dated August 15, 2007, shows that this debt was paid.\n1.d. This overdue debt to Creditor 4 is listed in the SOR in the amount of $617. Although\nApplicant testified that this debt has been paid,  he offered no evidence to establish that this debt was\nresolved. The record was held open to allow Applicant to offer evidence of payment, but no evidence\nwas ever introduced. \n1.e. This overdue debt to Creditor 5 is listed in the SOR in the amount of $625. Applicant\nclaimed that he did not recognize this debt, nor has he been able to get verification of its origin.  He\nhas made no payment on this debt.\n1.f. This overdue debt to Creditor 6 is listed in the SOR  is in the amount of $84. Applicant\ntestified that this debt has been paid. Exhibit 8 establishes that this debt was paid.\n1.g. This overdue debt to Creditor 7 is listed in the SOR in the amount of $92. Applicant\ntestified that this debt has been paid, but again he offered no evidence to establish that this debt was\nresolved. The record was held open to allow Applicant to offer evidence of payment, but no evidence\nwas ever introduced. \n\n4\n1.h. This overdue debt to Creditor 8 is listed in the SOR in the amount of $48. Applicant\ntestified that he believed that this debt has been paid, but offered no evidence to establish that this\ndebt was resolved. The record was held open to allow Applicant to offer evidence of payment, but\nno evidence  was ever introduced. \n1.i. This overdue debt to Creditor 9 is listed in the SOR in the amount of $138. Applicant\ntestified that this debt has been paid, but offered no evidence to establish that this debt was resolved.\nThe record was held open to allow Applicant to offer evidence of payment, but no evidence  was ever\nintroduced. \n1.j. This overdue debt to Creditor 10 is listed in the SOR in the amount of $57. Applicant\ntestified that this debt has been paid. Exhibit 8 establishes that this debt was paid.\n1.k. This overdue debt to Creditor 11 is listed in the SOR in the amount of $5,410. Applicant\ntestified that he made one payment of $100 on this debt in May 2007, and the total now owed is\n$5,310. \n1.l. This overdue debt to Creditor 12 is listed in the SOR in the amount of $4,290. Applicant\ntestified that he made one payment of $100 on this debt in June 2007, and the total now owed is\n$4,190. \n1.m. This overdue debt to Creditor 13 is listed in the SOR in the amount of $218. Applicant\ntestified that this debt has been paid. However, Exhibit 8 shows that this debt was unpaid. The record\nwas held open to allow Applicant to offer evidence of payment, but no evidence  was ever introduced.\n1.n. This overdue debt to Creditor 14 is listed in the SOR in the amount of $119. Applicant\ntestified that this debt has been paid. Exhibit 8 establishes that this debt was paid.\n1.o. This overdue debt to Creditor 15 is listed in the SOR in the amount of $203. Applicant\ntestified that this debt has not been paid.\n1.p. This overdue debt to Creditor 16 is listed in the SOR in the amount of $45. Applicant\ntestified that this debt has been paid. Exhibit 8 establishes that this debt was paid.\n1.q. This overdue debt to Creditor 17 is listed in the SOR in the amount of $319. Applicant\ntestified that this debt has been paid. Exhibit 8 establishes that this debt was paid.\n1.r. This overdue debt to Creditor 18 is listed in the SOR in the amount of $22. Applicant\ntestified that this debt has been paid, but offered no evidence to establish that this debt was resolved.\nThe record was held open to allow Applicant to offer evidence of payment, but no evidence  was ever\nintroduced. \n1.s. This overdue debt to Creditor 19 is listed in the SOR in the amount of $374. Applicant\ntestified that this debt has not been paid.\nApplicant testified that he primarily got into financial difficulties as a result of his divorce,\nwhen it was his understanding that his ex-wife was responsible for paying certain debts, and he only\nlearned later that she had not resolved these debts, and he was still responsible.\n\n5\nParagraph 2 (Guideline E - Personal Conduct)\nThe Government alleges that when Applicant completed a signed, sworn Security Clearance\nApplication (SCA) on April 28, 2005, (Exhibit 1), he did not furnish truthful, complete answers. \n2.a. Question #21 asks, \u201cHave you ever been charged with or convicted of any felony\noffense?\u201d He was instructed to \u201creport information regardless of whether the record in your case was\nsealed or otherwise stricken from the record.\u201d\nQuestion #22 asks, \u201cHave you ever been charged with or convicted of a firearms or explosive\noffense?\u201d  Applicant answered \u201cNo\u201d to these two questions, even though he was arrested on March\n29, 1979 and charged with Unlawful Sale of a Firearm, a felony offense. He was found guilty of\nunlawful Transfer of Firearm with ID, a felony offense, and he was sentenced to six months in the\nhouse of Corrections, suspended, and he was placed on one year probation. \nApplicant testified that the arrest was because he sold an old rifle, that belonged to his brother,\nto some men, who were undercover police officers. Later, he was told that the record of this case was\nsealed and that he was not required to address it any longer.  He testified that he did not read the\nquestions carefully, and so he did not realize that even if his record  was sealed, he should have listed\nthe 1979 conviction. \n2.c. Question #34 asks,  \u201cIn the last 7 years, have you had your wages garnished for any\nreason?\u201d  Question #37 asks,  \u201cIn the last 7 years, have you had you had any judgements against you\nthat have not been paid?\u201d  Applicant answered \u201cNo\u201d to these questions. As discussed in 1.a., above,\nApplicant testified credibly that no garnishment was ever placed against him, nor was he aware of any\njudgement against him.\n2.c. Question #38 asks,  \u201cIn the last 7 years, have you been over 180 days delinquent on any\ndebt(s)?\u201d  \u201cNo\u201d was checked off for this question. Clearly, at the time he completed the SCA,\nApplicant was or had been delinquent on all the debts listed on the SOR, and all of these debts should\nhave been included.\n2.d. Question #39 asks,  \u201cAre you currently over 90 days delinquent on any debt(s)?\u201d\u201cNo\u201d was\nanswered on this question and again no debts were listed. At the time he completed the SCA,\nApplicant was still delinquent on the debts listed on the SOR, and these debts should have been\nincluded. Applicant admitted that he was aware of some overdue debts although not all of them. His\nlimited explanation during his testimony was, \u201cI did not think that it was going to be dug into that\nfar.\u201d\nWhile Applicant did have some legitimate reasons for his failure to fully and completely\nanswer Questions #21, 24, 34, and 37, I can find no reasonable explanation for Applicant\u2019s failure\nto affirmatively answer Questions #38 or 39, and to list, at a minimum, the debts of which he was\naware.\n\n6\n(Guideline J - Criminal Conduct)\nThe Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance because\nhe furnished information on a SCA in 2005 to the Government that was not complete and truthful,\nwhich is a violation of Federal Law, Title 18, United States Code Section 1001.\nPOLICIES\nEnclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines that must be carefully\nconsidered in evaluating an individual's security eligibility and making the overall common sense\ndetermination required. The Administrative Judge must take into account the conditions raising or\nmitigating security concerns in each area applicable to the facts and circumstances presented.\nAlthough the presence or absence of a particular condition for or against clearance is not\ndeterminative, the specific adjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be\nmeasured against this policy guidance, as the guidelines reflect consideration of those factors of\nseriousness, recency, motivation, etc. \nThe adjudication process is based on the whole person concept. All available, reliable\ninformation about the person, past and present, is to be taken into account in reaching a decision as\nto whether a person is an acceptable security risk.\nEach adjudicative decision must also include an assessment of: (1) the nature, extent, and\nseriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, and the extent of\nknowledgeable participation; (3) how recent and frequent the behavior was; (4) the individual's age\nand maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or\nabsence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct;\n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation\nor recurrence (See Directive, Section E2.2.1. of Enclosure 2). \nBURDEN OF PROOF\n              Initially, the Government must prove controverted facts alleged in the Statement of Reasons.\nIf the Government meets that burden, the burden of persuasion then shifts to Applicant to establish\nhis security suitability through evidence of refutation, extenuation or mitigation sufficient to\ndemonstrate that, despite the existence of disqualifying conduct, it is nevertheless clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue the security clearance. Assessment of Applicant's fitness\nfor access to classified information requires evaluation of the whole person, and consideration of such\nfactors as the recency and frequency of the disqualifying conduct, the likelihood of recurrence, and\nevidence of rehabilitation.\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with\nthe U.S. Government that is predicated upon trust and confidence. Where facts proven by the\nGovernment raise doubts about Applicant's judgment, reliability, or trustworthiness, Applicant has\na heavy burden of persuasion to demonstrate that he or she is nonetheless security worthy. As noted\nby the United States Supreme Court in Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988),\n\n7\n\"the clearly consistent standard indicates that security-clearance determinations should err, if they\nmust, on the side of denials.\"\nCONCLUSIONS\nHaving considered the evidence of record in light of the appropriate legal precepts and factors,\nI conclude the following with regarding Guidelines F,  E, and J: \n(Guideline F - Financial Considerations)\nWith respect to Guideline F, the Government has established that Applicant has had a history\nof financial difficulties. The evidence shows that Applicant has made recent good efforts to pay these\ndebts. While he has not satisfied all of his debts, he has satisfied many of his debts and seems to be\non his way to satisfying the rest of them in an organized manner. \nRegarding the Disqualifying Conditions (DC) under Guideline F in the Adjudicative\nGuidelines, I conclude both DC 19. (a) and (c) apply, because of Appellant\u2019s \u201chistory of not meeting\nfinancial obligations\u201d and his apparent previous \u201cunwillingness to satisfy his debts.\u201d \nIn considering the Mitigating Conditions (MC) 20. I find that MC (b) applies \u201cthe condition\nthat resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond person\u2019s control,\u201d as they were the result\nof his divorce.  I also find that MC (d) applies because Appellant has \u201cinitiated a good-faith effort to\nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.\u201d I, therefore, hold Guideline F for Applicant.\n(Guideline E - Personal Conduct)\nWith respect to Guideline E, the evidence establishes that Applicant did not provide accurate\ninformation to the Government in response to several questions on the SCA that he completed and\nexecuted on April 28, 2005. \nTwo questions, #38 and 39, are of primary concern because Applicant  clearly knew he was\ncurrently more than 90 days overdue on at least some of his debts, and he had been over 180 days\noverdue in the past seven years.\nIn the Adjudicative Guidelines for Personal Conduct, I conclude that DC 16. (a) applies as the\nApplicant has provided deliberate omissions and falsification of relevant facts from a personnel\nsecurity questionnaire.  Based on the recency and relevancy of the false statements made to the\nGovernment, I do not see that any MC applies.\n(Guideline J - Criminal Conduct)\nIn the Adjudicative Guidelines for Criminal Conduct, I conclude that Applicant's criminal\nconduct falls within Criminal Conduct DC 31. (a) \u201ca single serious crime,\u201d for the untruthful\n\n8\ninformation that he furnished the Government on the SCA, which is a violation of Federal Law, Title\n18, United States Code, a felony.  No Mitigating Condition (MC) applies to this case.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal Findings are hereby rendered as follows:\nParagraph 1, Financial Considerations,  Guideline F: For Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.a.: For Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b.: For Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c.: For Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d.: For Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e.: For Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f.: For Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g.: For Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h.: For Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.i.: For Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.j.: For Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.k.: For Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.l.: For Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.m.: For Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.n.: For Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.o.: For Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.p.: For Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.q.: For Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.r.: For Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.s.: For Applicant\nParagraph 2, Personal Conduct,  Guideline E:Against Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.a.: Against  Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b.: Against Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.c.: Against Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.d.: Against Applicant\nParagraph 3, Criminal Conduct,  Guideline J: Against Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b.: Against Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances and facts presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.\n\n9\nMartin H.

WHITE\nAPPEARANCES\nFOR GOVERNMENT\nCandace L. Le\u2019i, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nSYNOPSIS\nApplicant owes more than $15,400 in delinquent state taxes that came due each year from\n1986 to 1991. She has not incurred additional delinquent taxes or other delinquent debt in 15 years.\nDespite a stated intention to resolve these debts, she provided no documentation of such efforts, and\nno other evidence in mitigation of security concerns raised by her history of, and ongoing inability\nor unwillingness to meet financial obligations imposed by government regulation. Clearance is\ndenied.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\n\nItem 4 at 1 (Applicant\u2019s letter response to SOR, dated Apr. 23, 2007).\n1\nThe motion sought to substitute the words \u201cthe Internal Revenue Service (IRS)\u201d for the words \u201cFranchise Tax\n2\nBoard of the State of California\u201d in describing the creditor in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c, and 1.d.\nFORM at 4. Department Counsel concurred with Applicant that her 2006 \u201cno\u201d answer was not false in that the\n3\nalleged tax liens were placed against her in 1993 and 1994, more than seven years earlier.\nThe government submitted ten items in support of the allegations.\n4\nFORM at 2-3, 4-5.\n5\n2\nApplicant applied for a security clearance on March 22, 2006, in conjunction with her\nemployment by a defense contractor. On March 28, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and\nAppeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, pursuant to Executive Order\n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry, dated February 20, 1960, as amended,\nand Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance\nReview Program (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended. The SOR detailed reasons, under\nGuideline F (Financial Considerations), and Guideline E (Personal Conduct), why DOHA could not\nmake the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant a security clearance for Applicant, and recommended referral to an\nadministrative judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or\nrevoked.\nApplicant responded to the SOR allegations in two notarized letters, dated April 23, 2007,\nand May 24, 2007, admitting the truth of the Guideline F allegations. She denied that her \u201cno\u201d\nanswer concerning tax liens placed in the past seven years was an intentional falsification because\nthe liens were placed more than seven years earlier.  She did not submit any other matters for\n1\nconsideration in extenuation or mitigation of her admissions. Department Counsel submitted the\ngovernment's written case on July 11, 2007, including a motion to amend two of the Guideline F\nallegations  and withdrawal of the sole Guideline E allegation  in the SOR. A complete copy of the\n2\n3\nfile of relevant material (FORM)  was provided to Applicant, and she was afforded an opportunity\n4\nto file objections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation. Applicant signed the\ndocument acknowledging receipt of her copy of the FORM on August 2, 2007, and returned it to\nDOHA. She did not submit any further response to the FORM by the September 2, 2007 due date,\nnor did she request an extension of time to respond. The case was assigned to me on October 5,\n2007.\nMOTION TO AMEND SOR           \nIn the FORM, Department Counsel moved to amend the SOR by substituting the IRS for the\nCalifornia Franchise Tax Board as the creditor alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c, and 1.d, to conform the SOR\nto her understanding of the evidence.  In her earlier answer, Applicant formally admitted the truth\n5\nof the two allegations in question as originally written, and she did not respond to the motion to\namend. \nDepartment Counsel mistakenly argued that these SOR allegations and admissions involved\ntax liens, when in fact they refer only to tax debts. Department counsel correctly notes that the March\n1993 tax lien noted in Items 7, 8, and 9, was placed for federal tax debt, not California state taxes.\n\nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14.\n6\nSee Item 3. Although he denied that the statements in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 1.c and 1.d were accurate as of the date\n7\nof his response, he admitted that he had owed each listed debt and said he had made payments, during February 2007,\ntoward these debts as further specified below. \nItem 5 (e-QIP security clearance questionnaire, dated Mar. 22, 2006) at 6, 11.\n8\nItem 5 at 14-17.\n9\n3\nHowever, there is no evidence in this record that would indicate that the single $7,515 federal tax\nlien corresponded to two separate tax debts in the amounts of $2,295.90 for tax year 1987, and\n$3,134.08 for tax year 1988 (totaling $5,429.98) alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c, and 1.d. Nor is there any\nlogical reason to infer the federal lien covers the debts alleged in those two paragraphs but not the\none alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b, which also has no corresponding tax lien shown in the evidence. \nThe requested amendments have no evidentiary support in the record. Nothing indicates that\nApplicant has federal tax debts of those amounts for those years, and Applicant did not admit the\ntruth of the proposed amended allegations. In fact, Applicant denied knowledge of any delinquent\ndebts other than for California taxes in her response to interrogatories, dated January 10, 2007. The\nmere fact that a non-alleged federal tax lien was placed against Applicant in 1993 does not provide\nany proof that the particular facts of the proposed amended allegations are true.\nThe addition of alleged federal tax debt to taxes owed to a state franchise tax board also\nwould change the nature, not merely the details, of the allegation since Applicant is seeking to enter\ninto a fiduciary relationship with the federal, not state, government. This can not be permitted\nwithout a more formal notice and opportunity to respond than is represented by Applicant\u2019s failure\nto reply to the FORM, especially in the absence of any evidence supporting the truth of the proposed\namended allegations.\nAccordingly, Department Counsel\u2019s motion to amend SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c and 1.d is denied. I do not\nconstrue this motion as one seeking to withdraw the original allegations in those paragraphs if they\nare not amended. The original allegations are supported by Applicant\u2019s admissions that they are true,\nand the Directive only requires independent evidence of controverted facts.6\nFINDINGS OF FACT            \nApplicant admitted the truth of the factual allegations set forth in the SOR pertaining to\nfinancial considerations under Guideline F (subparagraphs 1.a through 1.d).  Those admissions are\n7\nincorporated herein as findings of fact. After complete and thorough review of the evidence in the\nrecord, and upon due consideration of same, I make the following additional findings of fact:\nApplicant is a 43-year-old self-employed fire protection designer, seeking to obtain a security\nclearance in connection with subcontract work for a defense contractor.  She was married to her first\n8\nhusband from August 1990 to September 1997. She married her current husband in June 2001, and\nthey have one child born in April 2004.  Her March 6, 2007, credit bureau report (CBR) reflected\n9\n\nItem 8 at 2.\n10\nItem 7 at 3. The CBR reports that the new loan has a $507 monthly payment.\n11\nItem 7 at 1; Item 8 at 1; Item 10 at 1. These CBRs and Item 9 also reflect a 1993 federal tax lien for $7,515.\n12\nItem 4 at 2.\n13\nItem 6 at 2-3. \n14\nItem 7 at 1.\n15\nDoD recently issued an updated version of the Directive containing the revised adjudicative guidelines\n16\nimplemented by the Undersecretary of Defense for Intelligence on Aug. 30, 2006, and made effective for any\nadjudication in which a SOR was not issued before Sept. 1, 2006.\n4\na total of $13,552 in revolving and installment debt, on which all payments were current.  Her July\n10\n3, 2007, CBR showed this total had increased to $37, 414, with the April 2007 addition of slightly\nmore than $29,000 for \u201crecreational merchandise,\u201d and that all payments remained current.  \n11\nThe two CBRs, and California public records reflect a state tax lien against Applicant (under\nher maiden name), in the amount of $9,487.  This corresponds to the delinquent franchise board tax\n12\ndebt for tax years 1989, 1990, and 1991, that was alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a, and which she admitted\nremains unpaid. There is no independent evidence in this record of the delinquent state tax debts for\ntax years 1986, 1987, and 1988, alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.c, and 1.d, totaling just under $6,000.\nHowever, Applicant also admitted the truth of these allegations.13\nIn her response to interrogatories, dated January 10, 2007, Applicant stated that she had paid\nall taxes due for the past 15 years, and that her former tax troubles arose from following bad tax\nadvice from her first husband. She further indicated that she was working with her current tax\nadviser to prepare an offer in compromise to settle her tax debts and resolve the liens. She indicated\nthat she did not then have the funds to make or pay the offer, but should have them within three\nmonths.  She did not provide either documentation or any update concerning these efforts in\n14\nresponse to the SOR or FORM, and the lien remained on her July 2007 CBR.  Applicant provided\n15\nno further evidence in extenuation or mitigation of her financial situation, or concerning her\nresponsibility, trustworthiness and reliability in general.\n \nPOLICIES            \nEnclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines which must be considered in\nthe evaluation of security suitability.  In addition to brief introductory explanations for each\n16\nguideline, the adjudicative guidelines are divided into disqualifying conditions (DC) that may raise\nsecurity concerns, and mitigating conditions (MC) that may reduce or negate security concerns.\nApplicable DCs and MCs under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) must be considered in\ndeciding whether to grant or deny Applicant's eligibility for access to classified information.\nAn administrative judge need not view the adjudicative guidelines as inflexible, ironclad\nrules of law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are\nintended to be applied in conjunction with the factors set forth in the Adjudicative Process provision\n\nDirective, Enclosure 2, Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified\n17\nInformation, dated August 2006, at \u00b6 2.\nId. at \u00b6 2(a).\n18\nId. at \u00b6\u00b6 2(b), 2(c).\n19\n\u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might  accept as adequate to support\n20\na conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the record.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd.

Federal Maritime Comm\u2019n, 383 U.S. 607, 620 (1966).  \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a\nscintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4  Cir. 1994).\nth\nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14.\n21\nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n22\n5\nof the Directive,  to assist the administrative judge in reaching fair and impartial, common sense\n17\ndecisions.\nThe entire decision-making process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables\nknown as the \"whole person concept.\" All available, reliable information about the person, past and\npresent, favorable and unfavorable, should be considered in making a meaningful decision. The\nAdjudicative Process factors which an administrative judge should consider, in addition to the\napplicable guidelines, are: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency\nand recency of the conduct; (4) the individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the\nextent to which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.18\nProtection of the national security is the paramount consideration, so the final decision in\neach case must be arrived at by applying the standard that issuance of a clearance must be clearly\nconsistent with the interests of national security. Any doubt as to whether access to classified\ninformation is clearly consistent with national security must be resolved in favor of the national\nsecurity.  In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical\n19\nand based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nIn the decision-making process, facts must be established by \u201csubstantial evidence.\u201d  The\n20\nburden of producing evidence initially falls on the government to establish a case which\ndemonstrates, in accordance with the Directive, it is not clearly consistent with the national interest\nto grant or continue an applicant's access to classified information. \u201cDepartment Counsel is\nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to establish facts alleged in the SOR that\nhave been controverted.\u201d  \u201cThe applicant is responsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence\n21\nto rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department\nCounsel, and [Applicant] has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance\ndecision.\u201d  Once it has met its initial burden of production, the burden of persuasion (including any\n22\n\nISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd.

July 6, 2006). \nDirective, Enclosure 2, at \u00b6 18.\n24\n6\nburden to disprove a mitigating condition) never shifts to the government.  \n23\nA person applying for access to classified information seeks to enter a fiduciary relationship\nwith the government predicated upon trust and confidence. It is a relationship that transcends normal\nduty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well. It is because of this special relationship\nthat the government must be able to repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals\nto whom it grants access to classified information. Decisions under this Directive include, by\nnecessity, consideration of the possible risk an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to\nprotect or safeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified\ninformation. Section 7 of Executive Order 10865 specifically provides that any adverse industrial\nsecurity clearance decision shall be \"in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a\ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\"\nCONCLUSIONS          \nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all appropriate legal\nprecepts, factors, and conditions, including those described briefly above, I conclude the following\nwith respect to each allegation set forth in the SOR:\nGuideline F (Financial Considerations)          \n\u201cFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial obligations\nmay indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations,\nall of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information. An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage\nin illegal acts to generate funds.\u201d24\nI have considered all the financial considerations disqualifying conditions (FC DC), and\nconclude that FC DC 19(a) (\u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts\u201d) and FC DC 19(c) (\u201ca\nhistory of not meeting financial obligations\u201d) apply. Applicant admitted to owing more than $15, 400\nin delinquent taxes to the state of California. These taxes were due to be paid for tax years 1986 to\n1991, 16 to 21 years ago. Applicant expressed her then-present inability to satisfy those delinquent\ndebts as of January 2007, and provided no evidence she became able to pay them. She borrowed an\nadditional $29,000 to buy \u201crecreational merchandise\u201d in April 2007, rather than demonstrate any\neffort to resolve the debts that she was on full notice were creating security concerns. This shows an\nunwillingness to satisfy any of the four alleged debts. Her installment and revolving credit accounts\nare all current, but she admitted a twenty-year history of not meeting her financial obligations to the\nstate of California. There is no evidence that any other FC DC applies. \n  \n\n7\nI have considered all the Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions (FC MC) that might\napply to Applicant\u2019s history of not meeting financial obligations, and inability to satisfy debts. FC\nMC 20(a) (\u201cthe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such\ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current\nreliability, trustworthiness or good judgment\u201d) does not apply. Applicant has not incurred additional\ndelinquent tax debt for 15 years, but she has continued to owe these taxes throughout that period,\nand still does. Herconsistent  failure to demonstrate any effort to resolve these debts, and choice to\nincur additional debt for non-essential recreational merchandise, does cast doubt on her current\ntrustworthiness and good judgment. Nor was the behavior infrequent. It involved six consecutive tax\nyears, during which she also had federal tax issues resulting in a 1993 $7,515 lien. \nApplicant did not directly assert that financial security concerns should be mitigated under\nFC MC 20(b) (\u201cthe conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s\ncontrol (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death,\ndivorce or separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances\u201d). While she\nsaid the tax problems arose from following bad advice from her first husband, it is evident that she\nintentionally did not pay those taxes and has failed to do so ever since learning that she owed them.\nAccordingly, this record does not support application of FC MC 20(b).\nApplicant initially asserted, but made no attempt to document, that FC MC 20(c) (\u201cthe person\nhas received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear indications that the\nproblem is being resolved or is under control\u201d) applies. There is no evidence that the contemplated\noffer in compromise ever became more than a good intention. FC MC 20(d) (\u201cthe individual initiated\na good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts\u201d) does not apply for the\nsame reason.\nFinally, FC MC 20(e) (\u201cthe individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the\npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented proof to substantiate the\nbasis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions to resolve the issue\u201d) does not apply. Applicant\ndid not dispute the validity of any of the SOR-listed debts. FC MC 20(f)relates to unexplained\naffluence, and has no application here.\nWhole Person Analysis           \nApplicant\u2019s present inability or unwillingness, and 20-year history of failure to satisfy her\nstate tax obligations for the period 1986 to 1991 reflect an extensive and serious disregard of her\nobligations to government. While she blames bad advice she ignorantly followed for the initial\nproblems, the six-year period involved and the twenty years since, vitiate any mitigating effect of\noriginally not realizing she owed more tax. The conduct was frequent, and the resulting debt is\nongoing. Although she was in her early twenties when the tax debts arose, she is now fully mature\nand otherwise apparently financially stable. The likelihood of continuance is evident from the\nabsence of any indication the debts are being addressed, and the choice to incur additional non-\nessential debt rather than address those already owed. The fact that taxes are involved makes these\ndebts a greater security concern than ordinary consumer debts, because they more directly reflect an\nunwillingness to abide by government rules and regulations. Applicant provided no other evidence\nconcerning her trustworthiness, good judgment or reliability, and demonstrated no rehabilitative\nefforts. For the reasons stated, I conclude Applicant has not demonstrated that it is clearly consistent\nwith the interests of national security to grant her access to classified information.\n\n8\nFORMAL FINDINGS           \nFormal Findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required\nby Paragraph 25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a: \nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b: \nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c: \nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d: \nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline E:\nWithdrawn by Department Counsel\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nWithdrawn by Department Counsel\nDECISION            \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.

The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1990), as amended; \nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and \neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on August 27, 2007. He answered \nthe SOR in writing on August 30, 2007, and requested a hearing before an \nAdministrative Judge. Department Counsel was prepared to proceed on November 16, \n2007, and I received the case assignment on November 16, 2007. DOHA issued a \nnotice of hearing on November 20, 2007, and I convened the hearing as scheduled on \nDecember 11, 2007. The government offered Exhibits (GE) 1 through 7, which were \nreceived without objection.

DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on \nDecember 17, 2007. Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and \ntestimony, eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \nProcedural and Evidentiary Rulings \n \nRequest for Administrative Notice \n \nDepartment Counsel submitted a formal request that I take administrative notice \nof certain facts relating to Israel. The request and the attached documents were not \nadmitted into evidence but were included in the record as Hearing Exhibit I. The facts \nadministratively noticed are set out in the Findings of Fact, below.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions to the allegations in the SOR are incorporated herein. In \naddition, after a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I \nmake the following findings of fact. \n \nApplicant has been a senior principal consulting engineer for a federal contractor \nsince 2003. He was born in Israel in 1954 and he immigrated with his family to the U.S. \nin 1965. He became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 1973. He has one brother who is also \na naturalized citizen of the U.S. His brother is married and lives with his wife and child in \nthe U.S. Applicant\u2019s father is no longer living and his mother resides in California. \nApplicant is married and has two children.

He continued \nto serve in the Naval Reserves until 1983. He was a nuclear qualified submarine officer \nuntil he resigned to pursue an engineering career in the defense industry. During his \nmilitary and civilian career he held a top secret clearance and had access to Sensitive \nCompartmented Information (SCI) and held a Department of Energy \u201cQ\u201d clearance to \nallow him to work in the nuclear field. He also passed a lifestyle polygraph and special \nbackground investigation.1 He is also  a member in good standing of the Coast Guard \nAuxiliary and is attached to a Flotilla based in the state where he lives.2 \n \n \nIn 2002 Applicant went to Israel for approximately two weeks to vacation and \nattend his brother\u2019s wedding. While at the wedding he visited with aunts, uncles and \ncousins. He does not stay in contact with these relatives and has only had contact 3-4 \ntimes with them in the past 40 years. They all work in the private sector.

He was advised by \nIsraeli authorities that because he was born in Israel in order to leave he would be \nrequired to obtain an Israeli passport. He went to the appropriate office and he advised \nthem he was a U.S. citizen and lives in the U.S. In lieu of having to obtain an Israeli \npassport he was given an Israeli travel document that would allow him to leave Israel. \nThis document may be used in lieu of a passport. He used this document to leave \nIsrael.4  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s brother was a successful doctor in the U.S. and had residences in \nboth the U.S. and Israel at one time. He retired from the medical field and is now \ninvolved in venture capital investments. He and his wife had a child in April 2006. His \nbrother\u2019s wife is German and she has a U.S. green card.5 They were in Israel and when \nshe obtained her green card she was required to enter the U.S. by December 2006. \nApplicant anticipated they would be arriving in the U.S. in June or July of 2006. He \nanticipated seeing his new niece when his brother and family arrived. His brother\u2019s \narrival date kept being delayed. Applicant\u2019s wife found inexpensive plane tickets and \nApplicant had a week of vacation to use, so although they had not planned on going \nback to Israel, they decided to go and see the new baby. They traveled to Israel in \nOctober 2006 for the purpose of visiting his brother, his wife and new baby. Applicant \nwas required to renew the Israeli travel document he obtained in 2002. This document \nonly allowed him to travel in and out of Israel. He could not travel to any other country \non this document. His brother and his family moved permanently back to the U.S. in \nDecember 2006. His brother had always maintained a residence in the U.S. He had \nbusiness contacts in Israel and the U.S., but his primary residence was in the U.S. He \nno longer maintains a residence in Israel.  \n \n \nApplicant does not have an Israeli passport. He had an Israeli travel document \nthat was issued to him so he could leave Israel. He denies he is a dual citizen of Israel. \nHe has formally renounced any citizen rights he may have had with Israel.6 He \nrequested confirmation of his request, but had not received it at the time of the hearing. \nAt the present time he does not have any plans to travel to Israel.7 \n \n \nWhen providing information for his security clearance application (SCA), \nApplicant listed his brother\u2019s address in California as his brother\u2019s place of residence. At \nthe time his brother was living in Israel, but was traveling back and forth to the U.S. \nApplicant provided an address where he knew his brother could be located in the event \nsomeone wanted to interview him as part of his background check. He also knew his \nbrother would be returning shortly to the U.S. to reside permanently. He did not \ndeliberately conceal the information that his brother had a residence in Israel as this \n \n \n4 Tr. 53-61, 64-66; AE G. \n \n5 Tr. 47-49. \n \n6 AE B, C. \n \n7 Tr. 90-94. \n\n \n4 \n \n \n                                                          \ninformation had been previously disclosed as early as 2003. He was merely attempting \nto provide an address where he believed his brother would be easily located. Applicant \non previous occasions advised the government that his brother was living in Israel.8  \n \n \nWhen answering question 17 on his SCA that inquired if Applicant had a foreign \npassport, he answered \u201cNo.\u201d Applicant answered this question correctly and honestly. \nThe document he held was not a passport. He answered \u201cNo\u201d on interrogatories that \nasked the same question and specifically indicated he had a \u201cpass\u201d document and \nattached a copy of it to the interrogatories.9 Applicant did not intend to mislead anyone. \nHe simply answered the questions truthfully and provided an explanation of the \ndocument he did hold.10  \n \n \nOn June 27, 2006, Applicant was interviewed by a government investigator. He \nindicated that he had no plans to visit Israel. At that time he did not have plans to travel \nto Israel and this statement was true. However, his plans changed when his brother \ndelayed his move back to the U.S. That is when he and his family decided to go and \nvisit their new niece.11 At the time he completed his SCA he did not intend on returning \nto Israel. His plans changed after completion of the SCA. He did not deliberately provide \nfalse or misleading information. The information he provided at the time he completed \nthe SCA was truthful and honest.  \n \n \nApplicant does not own any property in Israel.  \n \n \nIsrael is a parliamentary democracy. Israel\u2019s prime minister leads the executive \nbranch of the government. The United States is Israel\u2019s leading trading partner. Israel \nrespects the rights of its citizens; however, there are some concerns about Israel\u2019s \ndetention and interrogation of alleged terrorists, and discrimination against Arabs. \nTerrorism is a continuing threat to Israel, and American interests in Israel. Since 1948, \nthe United States and Israel have developed a close friendship based on common \ndemocratic values, religious affinities, and security interests. Occasionally, Israeli and \nAmerican interests have diverged. Several U.S. government employees have been \nprosecuted for disclosure of classified information to persons connected to the Israeli \ngovernment. Israel has an active program to gather proprietary information from U.S. \ncompanies.12  \n \n \n \n \n \n8 Tr. 71-75. \n \n9 GE 2. \n  \n10 Tr. 76-78. \n \n11 Tr. 78-89. \n \n12 HE I.  \n\n \n5 \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline C, Foreign Preference \nUnder AG \u00b6 9 the security concern involving foreign preference arises: When an \nindividual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a foreign country over the \nUnited States, then he or she may be prone to provide information or make decisions \nthat are harmful to the interests of the United States. \nAG \u00b6 10 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying: I have specifically considered AG \u00b6 10 (a) (exercise of any right, privilege \nor obligation of foreign citizenship after becoming a U.S. citizen or through the foreign \ncitizenship of a family member. This includes but is not limited to: (1) possession of a \ncurrent foreign passport) and (b) (action to acquire or obtain recognition of a foreign \ncitizenship by an American citizen.) Applicant did not have a foreign passport nor did he \ntake any action to obtain or acquire recognition as a foreign citizen. He merely complied \nwith Israel\u2019s requirements to obtain a travel document when he attempted to enter Israel \nas a U.S. citizen born in Israel. I find none of the disqualifying conditions apply. \nHowever, if the Israeli travel document is construed to be an exercise of foreign \ncitizenship, I have considered all the mitigating conditions applicable to this guideline. \nSpecifically I have considered AG \u00b6 11 (a) (dual citizenship is based solely on parents\u2019 \ncitizenship or birth in a foreign country); (b) (the individual has expressed a willingness \nto renounce dual citizenship) and (e) (the passport has been destroyed, surrendered to \nthe cognizant security authority, or otherwise invalidated.) Applicant was born in Israel \nand as a child his family immigrated to the U.S. and he became a naturalized U.S. \ncitizen. AG \u00b6 11 (a) applies. Applicant does not consider himself an Israeli citizen, but \nbecause Israel considers him one he has formally renounced any citizenship ties with \nIsrael. AG \u00b6 11 (b) applies. Applicant does not have an Israeli passport. The Israeli \ntravel document he was required to obtain to exit Israel is expired. I find AG \u00b611 (c) \napplies if it was applied to a travel document. \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \nAG \u00b6 6 expresses the security concern regarding foreign influence: Foreign \ncontacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual has divided loyalties or \nforeign financial interests, may be manipulated or induced to help a foreign person, \ngroup, organization, or government in a way that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable \nto pressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Adjudication under this Guideline can \nand should consider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or \nfinancial interest is located, including, but not limited to, such considerations as whether \nthe foreign country is known to target United States citizens to obtain protected \ninformation and/or is associated with a risk of terrorism. \nAG \u00b6 7 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The SOR alleged under this guideline that Applicant traveled twice to \nIsrael. I have considered all of the disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 7. Even taking \n\n \n7 \n \n \nthe most expansive interpretation of the disqualifying conditions I find none apply. \nAlthough he traveled to Israel and AG \u00b6 7 (i) (conduct, especially while traveling outside \nthe U.S., which may make the individual vulnerable to exploitation, pressure, or \ncoercion by a foreign person, group, government, or country) might be considered, \nthere was no evidence offered about Applicant\u2019s conduct while he was traveling and \nthere was nothing to show he is vulnerable to exploitation, pressure, or coercion by a \nforeign person, group, government, or country. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern pertaining to personal conduct. Conduct \ninvolving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply \nwith rules and regulations can raise questions about an individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. Of special interest is any \nfailure to provide truthful and candid answers during the security clearance process or \nany other failure to cooperate with the security clearance process.  \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. I have specifically considered (a) (deliberate omission, concealment, or \nfalsification of relevant facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history \nstatement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities) and (b) (deliberately providing false \nor misleading information concerning relevant facts to an employer, investigator, \nsecurity \nofficial, \ncompetent \nmedical \nauthority, \nor \nother \nofficial \ngovernment \nrepresentative) under this guideline. I have considered all of the facts and find Applicant \ndid not deliberately omit, conceal, mislead, or falsify any information. He did not have an \nIsraeli passport, but rather had a travel document that he provided when he submitted \nhis interrogatories. The question was clear when it asked if he had a passport. It did not \nask if he had any documents from a foreign country and it is unfair to extrapolate such \nan interpretation. The fact is when provided the opportunity to explain what document \nhe had in his possession he did so and provided a copy of it. Applicant provided the \nbest address for his brother so that he could be easily contacted for a background \ncheck. He knew his brother was in the process of moving back to the U.S. but did not \nknow the exact date. Applicant was not attempting to mislead, but rather was attempting \nto assist investigators. When Applicant completed his interrogatories he did not intend \non returning to Israel. Due to the delay of his brother\u2019s return and securing inexpensive \nplane tickets, he and his family decided to go visit their new niece. Altering his plans \nafter he completed the interrogatories is not a deliberate falsification. I find none of the \ndisqualifying conditions apply.  \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \n\n \n8 \n \n \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness \nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation \nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent \nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant was born in Israel and is a \nnaturalized U.S. citizen. He has served his country in the Navy and held a Top Secret \nSecurity Clearance. He was required to comply with Israel\u2019s exit rules and obtain a \ntravel document because he was born there and not by choice. He has not exercised \nany dual citizenship rights and in an abundance of caution has formally renounced any \ncitizenship ties he may have with Israel. Israel is a close ally with the U.S. and it is \nunlikely to exploit U.S. citizens through coercion. Applicant answered all questions in his \nSCA honestly. He did not deliberately omit, mislead or falsify any information.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant mitigated the security concerns arising from foreign preference, \nforeign influence and personal conduct.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline C:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nParagraph, Guideline B: \n \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nParagraph, Guideline E: \n \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 3.a:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 3.b:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 3.c:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n\n \n9 \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (Feb. 20, 1960), as\n1\namended, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (Jan. 2, 1992), as amended (Directive).\nTr. at 77-78.\n2\n3\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a\nsecurity clearance for Applicant. On February 28, 2007, DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons1\n(SOR) detailing the basis for its decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial\nConsiderations) of the revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) issued on December 29, 2005, and\nimplemented by the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. The revised\nguidelines were provided to Applicant when the SOR was issued. Applicant answered the SOR in\nwriting on March 26, 2007, and elected to have a hearing before an administrative judge. The case\nwas assigned to me on April 18, 2007. A Notice of Hearing was issued on April 20, 2007, scheduling\nthe hearing for May 15, 2007. The hearing was conducted as scheduled to consider whether it is\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.\nDOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on May 25, 2007.\nRULINGS ON PROCEDURE AND EVIDENCE\nThe Government offered six exhibits that were marked as Government Exhibits (GE) 1\nthrough 6, and admitted without objections. The list of Government exhibits was marked as Hearing\nExhibit (HE) I. \nApplicant testified and offered seven exhibits that were marked Applicant Exhibits (AE) A\nthrough G, and admitted without objections. The record was left open to allow Applicant an\nopportunity to submit additional material. She did so in a timely manner, and submitted nine\ndocuments marked AE H through P, and admitted without objections. The documents include\nApplicant\u2019s letter of May 31, 2007 (AE H), personal budget for June 2007 (AE I), personal budget\nfor July 2007 (AE J), personal budget for August 2007 (AE K), creditor letter of May 30, 2007 (AE\nL), creditor letter of March 10, 2007 (AE M), creditor statement of March 25, 2007 (AE N), creditor\nstatement of August 20, 2006 (AE O), character letter of May 31, 2007 (AE P).

In addition,\nafter a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following\nfindings of fact.\nApplicant is a 35-year-old employee of a defense contractor. She is a college graduate.\nApplicant is married with a three-year-old daughter.3\nApplicant\u2019s financial problems started when she was in college.  She paid for her college and\nincurred credit card debt. She acknowledges she was young and irresponsible. Applicant received\ncredit counseling and enrolled in a program to pay her debts. She had her finances in order by 2000\nto 2001.4\nApplicant\u2019s finances became a problem again in about 2001. Applicant was going through\na contentious divorce from her former husband. While they were separated, Applicant lived with her\nfather, and her husband lived in their apartment. Their divorce was final in October 2001. When her\nformer husband moved out of their apartment, Applicant moved back in. He did not pay their rent\nand utilities while he was there, and Applicant was responsible for two months of back rent and\nutilities.5\nAround the same time as her divorce, Applicant was laid off from a good job. She was\nunemployed for a period of time. She could not find a job which paid as much as her former\nemployer. She eventually obtained three jobs in order to make ends meet.6\nApplicant remarried in 2003. Two weeks after her daughter was born in late 2003,\nApplicant\u2019s husband had shoulder surgery. He was on disability for several months before the\nsurgery and several months after the surgery. While on disability, he only collected about 60% of his\npay. After he came off disability, he had to switch jobs, earning substantially less than at his previous\njob.  At the same time, Applicant went on maternity leave, and was only earning 60% of her salary,\nwhich further strained their finances.7\nIn 2004, Applicant and her husband moved to another state which offered greater economic\nopportunities. Applicant has worked for the same federal contractor since September 2004. Her\ncurrent salary is more than $75,000.8\n\nTr. at 40-41.\n9\nTr. at 34-35; GE 2 at 6-7.\n10\nTr. at 36, 105.\n11\nTr. at 74-75; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; AE F, H, N.\n12\nTr. at 78-79.\n13\nTr. at 26-28; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; AE G, H, O.\n14\nTr. at 28-30, 79-80, 82-83; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; AE E, H, M.\n15\nTr. at 83-86; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; AE D, H, L.\n16\n5\nApplicant\u2019s husband did not obtain a decent full-time job after they arrived at their current\nlocation. He had additional medical problems and expenses. When he did work a full time job, the\nincome he earned was barely enough to offset the child care expenses. He became a full-time student\nand a stay-at-home father. He worked part-time jobs on nights and weekends.9\nApplicant\u2019s husband obtained a job in January 2007. He is permitted to take their daughter\nwith him when he works, which reduces their child care expenses.  Applicant and her family were\n10\nscheduled to move to another apartment at the end of May 2007, where the rent is $200 per month\ncheaper than their old apartment.11\nThe debt in SOR \u00b6 1.a in the amount of $237 is to a collection company, collecting on behalf\nof a utility company. Applicant testified she has contacted this creditor and set up a plan to pay $50\nper month until the debt is paid. Applicant paid $100 toward this debt on May 30, 2007.12\nThe debt in SOR \u00b6 1.b in the amount of $1,723 is to a collection agency, collecting on behalf\nof a computer company. Applicant testified she has not yet contacted this creditor. Her plan is to take\ncare of the debts below $1,000, and then address the larger debts.13\nThe debt in SOR \u00b6 1.c in the amount of $125 was paid in full on May 25, 2007.14\nThe medical debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d and 1.e, in the total amount of $826 were incurred as a\nresult of Applicant\u2019s pregnancy and delivery in 2003. Applicant\u2019s documents from a collection\nagency show four medical debts totaling $1,040, including the two debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d and\n1.e. Applicant testified the medical debt in SOR \u00b6 1.d in the amount of $97, resulted from her\ninsurance paperwork being improperly processed. She is attempting to correct that situation.\nApplicant acknowledges the remaining medical debts. She made a payment of $100 on May 29,\n2007. She expects to pay the medical debts by December 2007.15\nThe debt in SOR \u00b6 1.f in the amount of $44 was paid in full on March 26, 2007.16\n\nTr. at 87-88; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; AE A.\n17\nTr. at 88-91, 92-93; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR.\n18\nTr. at 89-90; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR.\n19\nTr. at 91-92, 94; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR.\n20\nTr. at 47-48.\n21\nTr. at 51, 95-97.\n22\nTr. at 97-101, 104, 112-126, 143; AE H-K.\n23\n6\nThe debt in SOR \u00b6 1.g in the amount of $230 was paid in full in July 2004.17\nThe debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.h, 1.j, 1.k, and 1.m, are credit card debts totaling $7,789. Applicant\nhas not yet addressed those debts.18\nApplicant admitted to the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.i, in the amount of $642, but she is unfamiliar with\nthe creditor. Her plan is to investigate this debt, and pay it if it is a valid debt.19\nThe debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.l and 1.n, totaling $920, are debts to cell phone companies. Applicant\nhas not yet addressed these debts.20\nApplicant and her husband incurred day care expenses when her husband was attending\ntraining for his current job, and for a period before he was able to bring their daughter to work with\nhim. Their day care provider permitted them to run up a bill to be paid later. At the end of March\n2007, the bill was about $1,250. They have since paid $600, and still owe $650, which they intend\nto pay.21\nApplicant obtained credit counseling after the credit problems she had during and shortly\nafter she was in college. She has not obtained credit counseling since she and her husband moved\nto their current location. Applicant received material from a credit consolidation company in 2005,\nbut after researching the company, she and her husband were not convinced it was a legitimate\ncompany. She researched several companies online, but did not find a company that met their\nneeds.22\nApplicant has a budget. She submitted her monthly budgets for June, July, and August 2007.\nShe set up a savings plan so that they have a buffer for unexpected expenses. Applicant and her\nhusband have large student loans that are deferred. Her deferment period will end in about\nSeptember 2007.  Applicant intends to pay her student loans as they become due. Her student loans\nare within Applicant\u2019s plan for addressing all her debts. Applicant\u2019s husband intends to go back to\nschool to an on-line institution in September 2007. He will be able to maintain his current job, which\nhas staggered hours. Applicant intends on paying all her delinquent debts. Her plan is to contact the\ncreditors for the larger debts as the smaller debts are paid, make an initial payment, and then set up\na payment schedule. The unpaid debts from the SOR total approximately $11,900.  \n23\n\nTr. at 145.\n24\nAE P.\n25\nAE B, C.\n26\nDepartment of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).\n27\nId. at 527.\n28\nExec.

Or. 10865 \u00a7 7.\n32\n7\nApplicant is well regarded at work. A supervisor, who testified on Applicant\u2019s behalf,\ndescribed her as very bright, intelligent, and conscientious, and recommended her for a security\nclearance.  Another manager wrote that Applicant is reliable and forthcoming, and a valued member\n24\nof their team.  A former supervisor and a former co-worker also sent letters praising her hard work,\n25\ndedication, ethics, and self-drive.26\nPOLICIES\n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d  As Commander in Chief, the President has\n27\n\u201cthe authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national security and to determine\nwhether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position . . . that will give that person\naccess to such information.\u201d  The President authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to\n28\ngrant applicants eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d  An applicant has the ultimate burden of\n29\ndemonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his or her\nsecurity clearance. The clearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations\nshould err, if they must, on the side of denials.  Any reasonable doubt about whether an applicant\n30\nshould be allowed access to sensitive information must be resolved in favor of protecting such\nsensitive information.  The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a\n31\ndetermination as to the loyalty of an applicant.  It is merely an indication that the applicant has not\nmet the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a\nclearance.  \n32\nThe revised Adjudicative Guidelines set forth potentially disqualifying conditions (DC) and\nmitigating conditions (MC) under each guideline. Additionally, each security clearance decision\nmust be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based on the relevant and material facts and\ncircumstances, the whole-person concept, along with the adjudicative process factors listed in the\nDirective and AG \u00b6 2(a).\n\n8\nConditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying, as well as those\nwhich would mitigate security concerns, are set forth and discussed in the conclusions section below.\nCONCLUSIONS\nI have carefully considered all the facts in evidence and the legal standards discussed above.\nI reach the following conclusions regarding the allegations in the SOR.\nGuideline F: Financial Considerations\nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial obligations\nmay indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations,\nall of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information. An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage\nin illegal acts to generate funds. \nBased on all the evidence, Financial Considerations Disqualifying Condition (FC DC) 19(a)\n(inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts), FC DC 19(c) (a history of not meeting financial\nobligations), and FC DC 19(e) (consistent spending beyond one\u2019s means, which may be indicated\nby excessive indebtedness, significant negative cash flow, high debt-to-income ratio, and or other\nfinancial analysis) apply in this case. Applicant incurred a number of delinquent debts, much of\nwhich remains unpaid. When she was younger and during her first marriage, Applicant and her\nhusband at the time, spent beyond their means.\nI have considered all the Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions (FC MC), and\nespecially considered FC MC 20(a) (the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or\noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the\nindividual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment), FC MC 20(b) (the conditions\nthat resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of\nemployment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or\nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances), FC MC 20(c) (the\nperson received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear indications that\nthe problem is being resolved or is under control), and FC MC 20(d) (the individual initiated a\ngood-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts).\nApplicant still owes a number of creditors. FC MC 20(a) does not apply. Applicant admits\nthat her financial issues when she was younger resulted from her irresponsibility. A number of\nfactors contributed to her recent financial problems, including the actions of her former husband; the\nloss of her job with subsequent unemployment and underemployment; and her husband\u2019s disability\nwhich coincided with her pregnancy and her time off work. I find FC MC 20(b) to be at least\npartially applicable.\nApplicant received counseling for her financial problems when she was younger. She\nstraightened out her finances with that assistance, but then had additional problems because of the\nfactors addressed above. She and her husband inquired but have not obtained counseling for her\nrecent problems. Applicant paid off one debt in 2004. She paid a debt in March 2007, and another\n\n9\nin May 2007. She also paid part of a debt for child care, which was not alleged in the SOR. She\nbegan making payments on two other debts. While Applicant still owes a large percentage of the\ndebts alleged in the SOR, she sincerely and credibly testified she intends on addressing and paying\nall her delinquent debts. She and her family moved to a less expensive apartment. Applicant makes\na good salary at her current employer. The amount still owed is approximately 16% of her annual\nsalary. With diligence, the payment of her debts is attainable. I find Applicant has initiated a good-\nfaith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts, and there are clear indications that\nthe problem is being resolved and is under control. FC MC 20(c) and FC MC 20(d) apply.\nWhole Person Analysis\nThe adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make\nan affirmative determination that the person is an acceptable security risk. Available, reliable\ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be considered in\nreaching a determination. In evaluating Applicant\u2019s case, I have considered the adjudicative process\nfactors listed in the Directive and AG \u00b6 2(a). I have also considered all the evidence, and every\nfinding of fact and conclusion discussed above. \nYouth and irresponsibility led to Applicant\u2019s initial financial problems. She sought help and\nwas well on her way to a sound financial state. A series of events, including a messy divorce, an\nirresponsible ex-husband, unemployment, loss of work for pregnancy, and her husband\u2019s disability,\ncaused Applicant to become delinquent on a number of debts. She and her husband moved to a state\nwith a better economy. Applicant now has stable employment, with a company which thinks very\nhighly of her, and pays her a good salary. She has begun the process of paying her delinquent debts.\nApplicant exhibited the sincerity and determination which will enable her to accomplish her goal.\nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions and evaluating all the evidence\nin the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has mitigated the security concerns based\non her financial issues.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nThe following are my conclusions as to each allegation in the SOR:\nParagraph 1.  Guideline F:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.n:\nFor Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. Clearance is\ngranted.\n\n10\nEdward W. Loughran\nAdministrative Judge\n",

On July 20, 2007, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the\nbasis for that decision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant\nrequested a hearing.  On November 30, 2007, after the hearing, Administrative Judge Matthew E.\nMalone denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant timely appealed pursuant to\nthe Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge erred by concluding that\nthe security concerns raised under Guideline F had not been mitigated.\nApplicant argues that the Judge\u2019s adverse decision should be reversed because the Judge did\nnot give sufficient weight to Applicant\u2019s mitigating evidence which showed that: (a) Applicant\u2019s\nindebtedness had resulted from circumstances beyond her control, the loss of employment, and (b)\nshe had paid off some of her outstanding debts and has sought the assistance of a credit restoration\nagency in order to clear up the remaining ones.  Applicant\u2019s arguments do not demonstrate that the\nJudge erred. \nOnce the government presents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the\napplicant to establish mitigation.  The application of disqualifying and mitigating conditions and\nwhole-person factors does not turn simply on a finding that one or more of them apply to the\nparticular facts of a case.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 01-14740 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan.15, 2003).  Thus,\nthe presence of some mitigating evidence does not alone compel the Judge to make a favorable\nsecurity clearance decision.  As the trier of fact, the Judge has to weigh the evidence as a whole and\ndecide whether the favorable evidence outweighs the unfavorable evidence, or vice versa.  An\napplicant\u2019s disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, or an ability to argue for a\ndifferent interpretation of the evidence, is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed the\nevidence or reached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See,\ne.g., ISCR Case No. 06-11172 at 2 (App. Bd. Sep. 4, 2007).\nIn this case, the Judge found that Applicant had a serious history of not meeting financial\nobligations.  At the time of the hearing, Applicant still had significant delinquent debts and was still\nin the process of resolving her financial problems.  In light of the foregoing, the Judge could\nreasonably conclude that Applicant\u2019s financial problems were still ongoing.   See, e.g., ISCR Case\nNo. 05-07747 at 2 (App. Bd. Jul. 3, 2007).  The Judge weighed the mitigating evidence offered by\nApplicant against the length and seriousness of the disqualifying conduct and considered the possible\napplication of relevant mitigating conditions and whole-person factors.  The Judge found in favor\nof Applicant with respect to a number of the SOR allegations.  However, the Judge reasonably\nexplained why the mitigating evidence was insufficient to overcome all of the government\u2019s security\nconcerns.  The Board does not review a case de novo.  The favorable record evidence cited by\nApplicant is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge\u2019s decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary\nto law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-11172 at 2 (App. Bd. Sep. 4, 2007).  Given the record that was\nbefore him, the Judge\u2019s ultimate unfavorable security clearance decision under Guideline F is\nsustainable.\n\n3\nOrder\nThe decision of the Judge denying Applicant a security clearance is AFFIRMED.\nSigned: Jeffrey D.

Her failure to timely act to pay\nor resolve her debts and her ongoing mismanagement of her personal finances undermined her\nclaims her debts resulted from circumstances beyond her control and that her finances will improve\nin the future. Clearance is denied.\n\n Required by Executive Order 10865, as amended, and by DoD Directive 5220.6 (Directive), as amended.\n1\n Adjudication of this case is controlled by the Revised Adjudicative Guidelines, approved by the President on\n2\nDecember 29, 2005,which were implemented by the Department of Defense on September 1, 2006. Pending official\nrevision of the Directive, the Revised Adjudicative Guidelines supercede the guidelines listed in Enclosure 2 to the\nDirective, and they apply to all adjudications or trustworthiness determinations in which an SOR was issued on or after\nSeptember 1, 2006.\n Applicant testified he was unemployed for most of the next year, but her SF 86 (Gx. 1) shows she returned\n3\nto work  as a binder in February 1998.\n2\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn March 23, 2005, Applicant submitted a Security Clearance Application (SF 86) to request\na security clearance needed for her current employment with a defense contractor. After reviewing\nthe results of the ensuing background investigation, adjudicators for the Defense Office of Hearings\nand Appeals (DOHA) were unable to make a preliminary affirmative finding  that it is clearly\n1\nconsistent with the national interest to give Applicant a security clearance. On July 20, 2007, DOHA\nissued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging she owed more than $20,976 for 11\ndelinquent credit obligations (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a - 1.k). The SOR allegations raise security concerns\naddressed in the Revised Adjudicative Guidelines  under Guideline F (financial considerations).\n2\nApplicant timely responded to the SOR and requested a hearing. The case was assigned to\nme on September 11, 2007, and I convened a hearing on October 11, 2007, at which the parties\nappeared as scheduled. Without objection, I admitted seven exhibits offered by the government (Gx.\n1 - 7). Applicant testified in her own behalf, and offered four exhibits, which were admitted without\nobjection as Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (Ax.) A - D. On November 11, 2007, Applicant submitted an\nadditional unsolicited exhibit. Despite the fact the record was closed, Department Counsel waived\nobjections to its admissibility. It is included in the record as Ax. E. DOHA received the transcript\n(Tr.) on October 19, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nIn response to the SOR, Applicant admitted the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a - 1.d, 1.j and 1.k.\nHer admissions are incorporated herein as facts. After a thorough review of the pleadings, transcript,\nand exhibits, I make the following additional findings of fact.\nApplicant is 49 years old and works as an electronics technician for a large defense\ncontractor.

She has paid or otherwise resolved four of those accounts\n\nAnswer to SOR; Gx. 4; Gx. 5. \n4\n Gx. 6; Tr., 74 - 75.\n5\n Tr., 90 - 91.\n6\n Tr., 55.\n7\n Tr., 72.\n8\n Tr., 69 - 70, 80 - 81, 97 - 98.\n9\n Ax.

She tried to get a loan from\nher credit union for the same purpose but was turned down, and still owes $1,236 for the fifth\nCapitol One account. Applicant also owes $9,847 for a delinquent Discover credit card account,\n$1,762 for a delinquent Providian credit card, and $806 for a delinquent Sears credit card.  Applicant\n4\nalso failed to pay three medical bills totaling $4,031. These accounts were generated when Applicant\nunderwent knee surgery in 1999 or 2000, and have been in collection as far back as 2001.\nApplicant asserts the Sears account was her mother\u2019s responsibility, but acknowledged she\nco-signed on the account because her mother is on a fixed income. The Discover card was opened\njointly with her husband about five years before they were married. Applicant has blamed the high\nbalance on that account on her husband\u2019s excessive spending.  Applicant also testified she had\n5\nallowed her adult children to obtain now-delinquent credit accounts using her name.6\nApplicant and her husband live in her mother\u2019s house rent free in exchange for paying the\nutilities.  Applicant brings home about $2,100 in monthly income after deductions. Her husband\n7\nbrings home about $1,200 each month.  When she was interviewed by a government investigator in\n8\nApril 2006, Applicant estimated she and her husband (who was not working at the time) had less\nthan $100 remaining each month after expenses, which did not include any debt payments. At her\nhearing, she estimated they now have about $200 remaining monthly.\nIn February 2006, Applicant and her husband entered into a three-year lease of a new SUV\nfor which they pay $880 each month, plus another $400 each month for insurance. This is the third\nsuccessive car lease they have executed, each one more expensive than the other. Because her\nhusband was unemployed when they executed the lease, Applicant assumed full responsibility for\nthe payments.9\nSince February 2007, Applicant has used the services of three different credit counseling and\nrepayment companies. She hoped they would consolidate her debts for her and present her with a\npayment plan. Although she paid monthly fees to the first two companies, neither actually negotiated\nany repayment of her debts or arranged for a debt consolidation loan.  After the hearing, Applicant\n10\nengaged a third company, which has arranged a repayment plan to resolve the $17,682 she still owes\n\n Ax. E.\n11\n Ax.

However, for the next five months, her monthly payment of $212 will go to the\ncompany\u2019s fees rather than pay her debts.11\nApplicant is well-respected at work. She has received several letters of appreciation for her\nwork, and has been recognized for her volunteer activities as well.12\nPOLICIES AND BURDEN OF PROOF\nEach security clearance decision must be a fair, impartial, and commonsense determination\nbased on examination of all available relevant and material information, and consideration of the\npertinent criteria and adjudication policy in the Revised Adjudicative Guidelines.  Decisions must\n13\nalso reflect consideration of the factors listed in \u00b6 2(a) of the new guidelines.  The presence or\n14\nabsence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not determinative of a conclusion for or against\nan applicant. However, specific applicable guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be\nmeasured against them as they represent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to\nclassified information. In this case, the pleadings and the information presented by the parties at\nhearing require consideration of the security concerns and adjudicative factors addressed in Revised\nAdjudicative Guideline F (financial considerations).\nA security clearance decision is intended to resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest  for an applicant to either receive or continue to have access to classified\n15\ninformation. The government bears the initial burden of producing admissible information on which\nit based the preliminary decision to deny or revoke a security clearance for an applicant.\nAdditionally, the government must be able to prove controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If the\ngovernment meets its burden, it then falls to the applicant to refute, extenuate or mitigate the\ngovernment\u2019s case. Because no one has a \u201cright\u201d to a security clearance, an applicant bears a heavy\nburden of persuasion.  A person who has access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\n16\nrelationship with the government based on trust and confidence. The government, therefore, has a\ncompelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgement, reliability and\ntrustworthiness of one who will protect the national interests as his or her own. The \u201cclearly\n\n See Egan; Revised Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 2(b).\n17\n Revised Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 18.\n18\n \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations;\u201d \n19\n \u201cindebtedness caused by frivolous or irresponsible spending and the absence of any evidence of willingness\n20\nor intent to pay the debt or establish a realistic plan to pay the debt;\u201d\n \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts;\u201d\n21\n \u201cconsistent spending beyond one's means, which may be indicated by excessive indebtedness, significant\n22\nnegative cash flow, high debt-to-income ratio, and/or other financial analysis;\u201d\n \u201cthe conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person's control (e.g. loss of\n23\nemployment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual\nacted responsibly under the circumstances;\u201d\n5\nconsistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any reasonable doubt about an\napplicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the government.17\nCONCLUSIONS\nFinancial Consideration. Under Guideline F, \u201c[f]ailure or inability to live within one\u2019s\nmeans, satisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment,\nor unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an\nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information. An individual\nwho is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.\u201d  The\n18\ngovernment presented sufficient information to support the allegations of delinquent debt in the\nSOR. Available information shows Applicant still owes more than $17,000 of the nearly $21,000\nin delinquent debt she has accrued since 2001. The record further shows she has misused personal\ncredit and continues to overspend despite being aware of the government\u2019s concerns about her\nfinances. Further, she has allowed others to use her personal information to get credit without any\nplan for repayment. The record requires consideration of Guideline F disqualifying conditions\n19(a),  19(b),  and 19(c),  and 19(e).\n19\n20\n21\n22\nIn light of Applicant\u2019s claim that her debts were caused by her lay-off in 1997, the record also\nrequires consideration of Guideline F mitigating condition 20(b).  However, the financial effects\n23\nof her lay-off have been eclipsed by the passage of time and Applicant\u2019s continued employment over\nmost of the 10 intervening years. This mitigating condition also requires Applicant show she acted\nreasonably in response to the unforseen events that may have caused her financial problems. She has\nnot done so. Her ongoing misuse of personal credit, and her poor financial decision making, most\nrecently illustrated by her 2006 vehicle leasing agreement which leaves her with little remaining cash\neach month, make 20(b) unavailable to her. Because the record does not support any of the other\nGuideline F mitigating conditions, Applicant has failed to mitigate the Guideline F security concerns.\n\n See footnote 14, supra.\n24\n See footnote 17, supra.\n25\n See footnote 13, supra.\n26\n6\nWhole Person. I have evaluated the facts presented in this record and have applied the\nappropriate adjudicative factors, pro and con, under Guideline F. I have also reviewed the record\nbefore me in the context of the whole person factors listed in Section 2(a) of the Revised\nAdjudicative Guidelines.  Despite the positive information about her on-the-job performance and\n24\nher volunteer activities, Applicant has not present information sufficient to find she is not likely to\nrepeat the poor financial conduct that has characterized much of her adult life. To her credit, she has\nattempted to get professional help to resolve her debts, but her failure to show she has corrected the\ncircumstances underlying her poor financial condition further buttresses the government\u2019s doubts\nabout her suitability for a clearance. Such doubts must be resolved in favor of the national security.25\nA fair and commonsense assessment  of all available information before me shows the Applicant\n26\nhas not yet overcome the government\u2019s reasonable doubts about his ability to protect classified\ninformation and to exercise the requisite good judgment and discretion expected of one who holds\na security clearance.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal findings regarding each SOR allegation are as follows:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations):\nAGAINST THE APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a - 1.d:\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e - 1.I:\nFor the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.j - 1.k:\nAgainst the Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant.

Applicant was in an automobile\ncollision in 2000, which resulted in the death of the driver of another car. He was convicted of\nnegligent manslaughter, and served more than a year in jail. When Applicant went to jail, he was\nunable to pay his debts. Applicant has not mitigated the financial considerations and criminal\nconduct security concerns. Additionally, under 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 986(c)(1), the Department of Defense\nmay not grant or continue a security clearance to one who was convicted of a crime, sentenced to\nmore than one year in jail, and actually served at least one year of incarceration. Clearance is denied.\n\nPursuant to Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (Feb. 20, 1960), as\n1\namended, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (Jan. 2, 1992), as amended (Directive).\n3\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a\nsecurity clearance for Applicant. On December 29, 2006, DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons1\n(SOR) detailing the basis for its decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline E (Personal\nConduct), Guideline F (Financial Considerations), and Guideline J (Criminal Conduct) of the revised\nAdjudicative Guidelines (AG) issued on December 29, 2005, and implemented by the Department\nof Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. The revised guidelines were provided to\nApplicant when the SOR was issued. Applicant answered the SOR in writing on February 1, 2007,\nand elected to have a hearing before an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on March\n2, 2007. A notice of hearing was issued on March 12, 2007, scheduling the hearing for April 5, 2007.\nThe hearing was conducted as scheduled to consider whether it is clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. DOHA received the hearing transcript\n(Tr.) on April 13, 2007.\nRULINGS ON EVIDENCE\nThe Government offered three exhibits that were marked as Government Exhibits (GE) 1\nthrough 3. The list of exhibits was marked Hearing Exhibit (HE) I. There was no objection to GE\n1, and it was admitted. GE 2 and 3 are reports of investigation (ROI), conducted for Applicant\u2019s\nbackground investigation. Applicant was advised of his right under \u00b6 E3.1.20 of the Directive to\nobject to their admission. Applicant did not object to their admission. Absent an objection, GE 2 and\n3 were admitted. Applicant testified and called a witness, but did not submit any documentary\nevidence. The record was left open to allow Applicant an opportunity to submit additional material.\nHe did so in a timely manner. Applicant submitted documents via fax to both Department Counsel\nand me. The fax cover sheets were different, but the attached documents were identical. A check to\nPalisades Collections and attached statement is marked Applicant Exhibit (AE) A. The check to\nGMAC is AE B. The check to Campen & Walsworth is AE C. The fax cover sheet to me is AE D.\nThe fax to Department Counsel with attached documents is AE E. The memo from Department\nCounsel forwarding the documents without objection is marked HE II. AE A through E are admitted.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant\u2019s admissions to the allegations in the SOR are incorporated herein. In addition,\nafter a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following\nfindings of fact.\n\nTr. at 20, 32; GE 1 at 2.\n2\nTr. at 29-32; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR.\n3\nTr. at 23-25, 33; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 2 at 1.\n4\nTr. at 23-25; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 3.\n5\nTr. at 18, 21; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 2 at 2.\n6\nTr. at 26-27; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 2 at 3; AE B.\n7\n4\nApplicant is a 42-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has a diploma from a\ntechnical school as an electronics technician. Applicant has never been married and has no children.2\nApplicant smoked marijuana approximately 120 times from about 1984 to 1998. He has not\nused any illegal drugs since then.3\nIn November 2000, Applicant was driving on a two-lane highway. He attempted to pass a\ncar, but could not pull in between that car and the car in front of it. He then passed both cars at a high\nrate of speed. After he was back in his lane, a car from the oncoming traffic attempted to pass, and\nentered Applicant\u2019s lane. Applicant swerved to avoid hitting the oncoming car. Applicant was still\nspeeding from his pass, approximately 90 miles per hour (MPH), in a 50-MPH zone. Because of his\nexcessive speed, Applicant lost control of his car, and hit a different oncoming car. The driver of the\noncoming car was killed in the collision. Drugs and alcohol were not a factor in the collision.  \n4\nApplicant was charged in state court with Count (1) negligent manslaughter; Count (2)\nreckless driving; Count (3) driving vehicle in excess of reasonable speed; Count (4) passing in a no\npassing zone; Count (5) failure to drive on right hand roadway; and Count (6) negligent driving.\nApplicant pled not guilty. After a jury trial, Applicant was found guilty of Counts (1), (2), (3), and\n(6). Counts (4) and (5) were dismissed. Counts (2), (3), and (6) were merged into Count (1) negligent\nmanslaughter, for the purpose of sentencing. Applicant was sentenced on February 26, 2003, to five\nyears in jail, with three years and six months suspended, 250 hours community service, and $168\ncourt costs.5\nApplicant served his sentence in jail from February 28, 2003 to March 25, 2004. He was\nreleased early for good behavior. Applicant completed his community service within six months of\nhis release from jail. He remains on probation for about another two years. Applicant has complied\nwith all the terms of his probation. Applicant has not driven a car since he was released from jail.\nHe is in the process of attempting to obtain a driver\u2019s license.6\nPrior to reporting to jail, Applicant had a car and an auto loan for that car. He notified the\nauto finance company that he would not continue making payments on the car, because of his\nimpending imprisonment. The car was repossessed in about February 2003. A balance remained after\nthe car was sold at auction. Applicant has been in contact with the finance company, and made\npayment arrangements of $100 per month. He made a payment of $100 on March 27, 2007. His\nbalance is approximately $7,500.7\n\nTr. at 27; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 2 at 3; AE C.\n8\nTr. at 27; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 2 at 3.\n9\nTr. at 35-38.\n10\nDepartment of the Navy v.

Applicant began making payments of $200 in August 2006. His most recent\npayments were $200, received by the collection agency on January 31, 2007, and $200, sent by\nApplicant on March 28, 2007. His balance before the most recent payment was $9,769.8\nAfter he was released from jail, Applicant retained the services of an attorney to facilitate the\ndisposal of a handgun. The attorney billed Applicant $700. Applicant thought the bill was too high\nand only paid part of the bill. Applicant paid the balance of $323 on March 1, 2007.9\nApplicant is well regarded by his employer. His supervisor, who is also the facility security\nofficer (FSO), testified that Applicant is loyal, responsible, trustworthy, and a definite asset to their\nteam.10\nPOLICIES\n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d  As Commander in Chief, the President has\n11\n\u201cthe authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national security and to determine\nwhether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position . . . that will give that person\naccess to such information.\u201d  The President authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to\n12\ngrant applicants eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d  An applicant has the ultimate burden of\n13\ndemonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his or her\nsecurity clearance. The clearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations\nshould err, if they must, on the side of denials.  Any reasonable doubt about whether an applicant\n14\nshould be allowed access to sensitive information must be resolved in favor of protecting such\nsensitive information.  The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a\n15\ndetermination as to the loyalty of an applicant. It is merely an indication that the applicant has not\nmet the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a\nclearance.  \n16\n\nISCR Case No. 04-12556 at 2 (App. Bd. Apr. 27, 2007).\n17\n6\nThe revised Adjudicative Guidelines set forth potentially disqualifying conditions (DC) and\nmitigating conditions (MC) under each guideline. Additionally, each security clearance decision\nmust be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based on the relevant and material facts and\ncircumstances, the whole-person concept, along with the adjudicative process factors listed in the\nDirective and AG \u00b6 2(a).\nConditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying, as well as those\nwhich would mitigate security concerns, are set forth and discussed in the conclusions section below.\nCONCLUSIONS\nI have carefully considered all the facts in evidence and the legal standards discussed above.\nI reach the following conclusions regarding the allegations in the SOR.\nGuideline E, Personal Conduct\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to\ncomply with rules and regulations can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability,\ntrustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information. Of special interest is any failure to\nprovide truthful and candid answers during the security clearance process or any other failure to\ncooperate with the security clearance process.\nThere are two potential Personal Conduct Disqualifying Conditions (PC DC) in this case, PC\nDC 16(c) (credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is not sufficient for\nan adverse determination under any other single guideline, but which, when considered as a whole,\nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack\nof candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating\nthat the person may not properly safeguard protected information) and PC DC 16(e) (personal\nconduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s conduct, that creates a vulnerability to\nexploitation, manipulation, or duress, such as (1) engaging in activities which, if known, may affect\nthe person\u2019s personal, professional, or community standing . . . ).\nApplicant\u2019s use of marijuana from 1984 through 1998, could also have been considered\nunder Guideline H (Drug Involvement). The Government presumably felt it was mitigated under that\nGuideline and therefore not alleged. Drug abuse is against the law and can also reflect questionable\njudgment, untrustworthiness, and unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations.  Applicant\u2019s\n17\ndrug abuse supports the application of PC DC 16(c). His marijuana use created a vulnerability to\nexploitation, manipulation, or duress. PC DC 16(e) is applicable based upon Applicant\u2019s drug abuse.\nI do not find PC DC 16(e) applicable to Applicant\u2019s failure to pay his financial obligations.\nApplicant\u2019s financial issues are discussed further under Guideline F. If the financial issues are\nsufficient for an adverse finding under Guideline F, then the financial issues would not trigger PC\nDC 16(c). \n\n7\nI have considered all the Personal Conduct Mitigating Conditions (PC MC), and I especially\nconsidered PC MC 17(c) (the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is so\ninfrequent, or it happened under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast\ndoubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment), PC MC 17(d) (the\nindividual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling to change the behavior or taken\nother positive steps to alleviate the stressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy,\nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur), and PC MC\n17(e) (the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability to exploitation,\nmanipulation, or duress). \nApplicant has not used any illegal drugs since 1998. PC MC 17(c), PC MC 17(d), and PC\nMC 17(e) all apply to Applicant\u2019s drug abuse. The drug abuse and financial delinquencies will be\nfurther considered in the \u201cwhole person\u201d discussion.\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial obligations\nmay indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations,\nall of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information. An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage\nin illegal acts to generate funds. \nBased on all the evidence, Financial Considerations Disqualifying Condition (FC DC) 19(a)\n(inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts) and FC DC 19(c) (a history of not meeting financial\nobligations) apply in this case. Applicant accumulated substantial delinquent debt after he went to\njail. \nI have considered all the Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions (FC MC), and\nespecially considered FC MC 20(a) (the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or\noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the\nindividual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment), FC MC 20(b) (the conditions\nthat resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of\nemployment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or\nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances), FC MC 20(c) (the\nperson received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear indications that\nthe problem is being resolved or is under control), and FC MC 20(d) (the individual initiated a\ngood-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts).\nThe credit card debt and the debt resulting from the repossession of Applicant\u2019s car were\ndirectly related to his serving time in jail. Applicant remains on probation for his crime. Most of the\nmoney owed on those two debts has not been paid. The debt to the attorney occurred after Applicant\nwas released from jail. It has now been paid in full. Applicant did not prove that the behavior\nhappened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to\nrecur and does not cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. FC MC\n20(a) does not apply. Applicant\u2019s incarceration for negligent manslaughter does not constitute a\ncondition that was largely beyond Applicant\u2019s control. FC MC 20(b) does not apply.\n\n8\nApplicant paid the attorney\u2019s fees. He started making $200 payments on the credit card debt.\nHe stated he was paying $200 per month since August 2006. His documents reveal a $200 payment\nreceived on January 31, 2007, and another $200 payment sent on March 28, 2007. Applicant did not\nsubmit documentation of other payments. I see no evidence of a February 2007 payment. While it\nappears that previous payments were made on this debt since the amount owed in the March 2007\nstatement is $1,400 less than the amount in the SOR, I cannot tell from the evidence with what\nregularity the payments were made. Applicant made one payment of $100 for the deficiency on his\nrepossessed car. Applicant is currently employed and there is no evidence of new delinquent debts.\nApplicant has started paying his delinquent debts, but he has not established a sufficient history of\nfinancial responsibility for me to find a clear indication that the problem is being resolved, under\ncontrol, or that he has made a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.\nFC MC 20(c) and FC MC 20(d) do not apply.\nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct\nCriminal activity creates doubt about an applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, and\ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply\nwith laws, rules and regulations. \nApplicant\u2019s conviction for negligent manslaughter establishes Criminal Conduct\nDisqualifying Condition (CC DC) 31(a) (a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses) and CC\nDC 31(c) (allegation or admissions of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was\nformally charged, formally prosecuted or convicted). Applicant is still on probation as a result of that\nconviction. CC DC 31(d) (individual is currently on parole or probation) also applies.\nI have considered all the mitigating conditions as they relate to CC DC 31(a) and CC DC\n31(c), and especially considered Criminal Conduct Mitigating Condition (CC MC) 32(a) (so much\ntime has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it happened under such unusual\ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability,\ntrustworthiness, or good judgment) and CC MC 32(d) (there is evidence of successful rehabilitation;\nincluding but not limited to the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or\nrestitution, job training or higher education, good employment record, or constructive community\ninvolvement).\nThe criminal activity that resulted in Applicant\u2019s conviction occurred in November 2000,\nmore than six years ago. There is no record of any criminal activity since that time. Applicant was\nreleased from jail on good behavior. He has complied with all the requirements of his probation, and\nhas a good employment record since his release. However, the crime was very serious, and resulted\nin the loss of an innocent person\u2019s life. Applicant remains on probation for his crime. I am unable\nto totally apply either CC DC 31(a) or CC DC 31(c).\nThis case also falls under CC DC 31(f) (conviction in a Federal or State court, including a\ncourt-martial, of a crime, sentenced to imprisonment for a term exceeding one year and\nincarceration as a result of that sentence for not less than a year), which implements 10 U.S.C. \u00a7\n986. Under 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 986(c)(1), the Department of Defense is prohibited from granting a security\nclearance to any applicant who was convicted of an offense in a U.S. court, was sentenced to more\nthan one year in jail, and was incarcerated as a result of that conviction for at least one year. \n\n9\nApplicant was convicted and sentenced to five years in jail, with three years and six months\nsuspended. He served his sentence in jail from February 28, 2003 to March 25, 2004. Applicant was\ntherefore sentenced to more than one year in jail, and incarcerated as a result of that conviction for\nmore than one year. CC DC 31(f) and 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 986 are both applicable. \nThe statute also provides that an exception to the prohibition may be authorized in a\nmeritorious case if there are mitigating factors. The waiver provision of the statute is implemented\nin CC MC 32(e) (potentially disqualifying conditions (b) and (f) above, may not be mitigated unless,\nwhere meritorious circumstances exist, the Secretaries of the Military Departments or designee, or\nthe Directors of Washington Headquarters Services (WHS), Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA),\nNational Security Agency (NSA), and Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) or designee,\nhas granted a waiver). Applicant cannot be granted a clearance under the provisions of 10 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 986(c)(1), unless he is granted a waiver. \nWhole Person Analysis\nThe adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make\nan affirmative determination that the person is an acceptable security risk. Available, reliable\ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be considered in\nreaching a determination. In evaluating Applicant\u2019s case, I have considered the adjudicative process\nfactors listed in the Directive and AG \u00b6 2(a). I have also considered every finding of fact and\nconclusion discussed above. \nApplicant used illegal drugs from 1984 to 1998. He committed negligent homicide in\nNovember 2000, resulting in his incarceration for more than a year. Because of his incarceration, he\nwas unable to pay a credit card debt and his car was repossessed, which resulted in a deficiency owed\non the loan. He was released from jail in March 2004, but only recently began paying his delinquent\ndebts. He is still on probation for his crime. He has complied with all the terms of his probation, and\nthere has been no subsequent criminal conduct. I also considered Applicant\u2019s favorable character\nevidence. \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions and evaluating all the evidence\nin the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has mitigated the personal conduct security\nconcerns. He has not mitigated the security concerns based on the financial considerations and his\ncriminal conduct. Additionally, Applicant is precluded from being granted access to classified\ninformation under CC DC 31(f) and 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 986(c)(1).\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nThe following are my conclusions as to each allegation in the SOR:\nParagraph 1.

In December 2005, Applicant\nhacked into a former employer\u2019s data network and disabled the company\u2019s phone system. Applicant\n\n2\nregretted his actions, informed the company, made restitution, and is receiving psychiatric treatment.\nHe has not mitigated the security concerns raised by his actions.

Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (Feb. 20, 1960), as\n1\namended, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (Jan. 2, 1992), as amended (Directive).\nTr. at 85; GE 1.\n2\nTr. at 86-90; GE 1; AE C.\n3\n3\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a\nsecurity clearance for Applicant. On January 30, 2007, DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons  (SOR)\n1\ndetailing the basis for its decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline E (Personal Conduct)\nand Guideline M (Use of Information Technology Systems) of the revised Adjudicative Guidelines\n(AG) issued on December 29, 2005, and implemented by the Department of Defense for SORs\nissued after September 1, 2006. The revised guidelines were provided to Applicant when the SOR\nwas issued. Applicant answered the SOR in writing on February 21, 2007, and elected to have a\nhearing before an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on April 4, 2007. A notice of\nhearing was issued on April 12, 2007, scheduling the hearing for May 17, 2007. The hearing was\nconducted as scheduled to consider whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant\nor continue a security clearance for Applicant. The Government offered two exhibits that were\nmarked as Government Exhibits (GE) 1 and 2, and admitted without objections. Applicant testified\nand offered 17 exhibits that were marked Applicant Exhibits (AE) A through Q, and admitted\nwithout objections. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on May 25, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant\u2019s admissions to the allegations in the SOR are incorporated herein. In addition,\nafter a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following\nfindings of fact.\nApplicant is a 37-year-old employee of a defense contractor.

On\nabout January 4, 2006, Applicant contacted his former company and admitted the actions he took.\nOn May 10, 2006, Applicant acknowledged in writing to his former company what he did to their\nsystem, and he paid the company $2,000 to reimburse them for their costs incurred in correcting the\nproblem.  \n5\nApplicant testified that he hacked into his former company\u2019s system because he thought the\ncompany might contact him to help correct the system, and he could \u201cshow them that they actually\nneeded me.\u201d6\nApplicant discussed the electronic intrusion into his former company\u2019s system when he was\ninterviewed pursuant to his background investigation on September 10, 2006.7\nA forensic psychiatric examination of Applicant was conducted by a psychiatrist on April 12,\n2007. The psychiatrist testified during the hearing. He has a background that includes national\nsecurity issues, and was accepted as an expert in forensic psychiatry. Applicant was diagnosed as\nsuffering from attention deficit disorder, about which Applicant was unaware. He was also found\nto be \u201csuffering from intermittent depression, anxiety, and sociophobia which are disorders grounded\nin some latent problems of adulthood, and from traumas sustained by him in his adolescent high\nschool years.\u201d  His problems are related to some significant self-esteem problems. Applicant has\n8\nweight problems which affected his body image and his personal image of himself. He is also\npsychologically immature, and much of his emotional psychological development is suspended at\nthe adolescent stage of development. The psychiatrist believes Applicant\u2019s immaturity clearly\ncontributed to his acts against his former employer.9\nThe psychiatrist found and testified that Applicant\u2019s problems are very treatable and that his\nprognosis is good with treatment. He further found that it is unlikely Applicant will repeat such an\nact, particularly if he accepts and obtains appropriate and recommended treatment for his problems.\n\nId.\n10\nTr. at 103-104; AE Q.\n11\nTr. at 122-123; AE K.\n12\nAE B, D, E.\n13\nAE L-P.\n14\nDepartment of the Navy v.

The psychologist for the\nmost part agrees with the psychiatrist\u2019s diagnosis, and that treatment for six to twelve months seems\nreasonable. The psychologist also recommends a psychiatric evaluation for possible antidepressant\nmedication. Applicant was scheduled to meet a treating psychiatrist the day after the hearing.11\nApplicant has informed his current employer about what he did to his former employer. His\nsupervisor wrote a letter on his behalf, acknowledging that Applicant informed her of his actions\nagainst his former employer. She cited his trustworthiness, intelligence, honesty, diligence,\nprofessionalism, dedication, security awareness, and respect for security rules and procedures. She\nstated his judgment in this incident was unquestionably poor, but believes it was a single mistake,\nand recommends him for a security clearance.  \n12\nApplicant\u2019s performance evaluations from both his current and former companies are\nexcellent.  Applicant submitted additional character letters from people who know him from both\n13\nhis current and former companies, as well as people who know him personally. All are aware of\nApplicant\u2019s actions. All were surprised by his actions and consider it a one-time event. They state\nApplicant is honest, trustworthy, professional, forthright, loyal to this country, with a tremendous\namount of integrity, and a man of principle. They all recommend Applicant for a security clearance.14\nPOLICIES\n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d  As Commander in Chief, the President has\n15\n\u201cthe authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national security and to determine\nwhether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position . . . that will give that person\naccess to such information.\u201d  The President authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to\n16\ngrant applicants eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d  An applicant has the ultimate burden of\n17\ndemonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his or her\nsecurity clearance. The clearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations\n\nISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002).\n18\nId.; Directive, \u00b6 E2.2.2.\n19\nExec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7.\n20\n6\nshould err, if they must, on the side of denials.  Any reasonable doubt about whether an applicant\n18\nshould be allowed access to sensitive information must be resolved in favor of protecting such\nsensitive information.  The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a\n19\ndetermination as to the loyalty of an applicant.  It is merely an indication that the applicant has not\nmet the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a\nclearance.  \n20\nThe revised Adjudicative Guidelines set forth potentially disqualifying conditions (DC) and\nmitigating conditions (MC) under each guideline. Additionally, each security clearance decision\nmust be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based on the relevant and material facts and\ncircumstances, the whole-person concept, along with the adjudicative process factors listed in the\nDirective and AG \u00b6 2(a).\nConditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying, as well as those\nwhich would mitigate security concerns, are set forth and discussed in the conclusions section below.\nCONCLUSIONS\nI have carefully considered all the facts in evidence and the legal standards discussed above.\nI reach the following conclusions regarding the allegations in the SOR.\nGuideline M: Use of Information Technology Systems\nNoncompliance with rules, procedures, guidelines or regulations pertaining to information\ntechnology systems may raise security concerns about an individual\u2019s reliability and  trustworthiness,\ncalling into question the willingness or ability to protect sensitive systems, networks, and\ninformation. Information Technology Systems include all related computer hardware, software,\nfirmware, and data used for the communication, transmission, processing, manipulation, storage, or\nprotection of information.\nBased on all the evidence, Use of Information Technology Systems Disqualifying Condition\n(UITS DC) 40(a) (illegal or unauthorized entry into any information technology system or\ncomponent thereof), UITS DC 40(b) (illegal or unauthorized modification, destruction, manipulation\nor denial of access to information, software, firmware, or hardware in an information technology\nsystem), UITS DC 40(c) (use of any information technology system to gain unauthorized access to\nanother system or to a compartmented area within the same system), and UITS DC 40(f)\n(introduction, removal, or duplication of hardware, firmware, software, or media to or from any\ninformation technology system without authorization, when prohibited by rules, procedures,\nguidelines or regulations) all apply in this case. \n\n7\nI have considered all the Use of Information Technology Systems Mitigating Conditions\n(UITS MC), and I especially considered UITS MC 41(a) (so much time has elapsed since the\nbehavior happened, or it happened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and\ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment). Applicant\u2019s\nconduct was very serious and recent, and it casts doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, and good\njudgment. Applicant\u2019s psychiatrist believes his psychological issues contributed to his conduct.\nThose psychological issues are only beginning to be addressed. I am unconvinced that this type of\nconduct will not recur. Applicant has not established UITS MC 41(a).\nGuideline E: Personal Conduct\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to\ncomply with rules and regulations can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability,\ntrustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information. Of special interest is any failure to\nprovide truthful and candid answers during the security clearance process or any other failure to\ncooperate with the security clearance process.\nThe potential Personal Conduct Disqualifying Condition (PC DC) in this case is PC DC 16(e)\n(personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s conduct, that creates a vulnerability\nto exploitation, manipulation, or duress, such as (1) engaging in activities which, if known, may\naffect the person\u2019s personal, professional, or community standing . . . ).\nApplicant\u2019s electronic intrusion into his former company\u2019s system, and disabling of their\ntelephone service is conduct which could affect Applicant\u2019s personal, professional, and community\nstanding. PC DC 16(e) is established.\nI have considered all the Personal Conduct Mitigating Conditions (PC MC), and I especially\nconsidered PC MC 17(c) (the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is so\ninfrequent, or it happened under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast\ndoubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment), PC MC 17(d) (the\nindividual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling to change the behavior or taken\nother positive steps to alleviate the stressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy,\nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur), and PC MC\n17(e) (the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability to exploitation,\nmanipulation, or duress). \nAs discussed above under the mitigating condition applicable under Guideline M, I find\nApplicant\u2019s conduct to be very serious and recent. It casts doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness,\nand good judgment. While he only disrupted the system once, and he is now receiving counseling\nand treatment, I am not convinced that it is unlikely to recur. PC MC 17(c) and PC MC 17(d) are not\napplicable.\nApplicant informed his former company of his actions and made restitution. He also\ninformed friends, associates, and his current company, and they continue to support him. That has\nreduced Applicant\u2019s vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, and duress. PC MC 17(e) is\napplicable.\n\nTr. at 55.\n21\n8\nWhole Person Analysis\nThe adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make\nan affirmative determination that the person is an acceptable security risk. Available, reliable\ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be considered in\nreaching a determination. In evaluating Applicant\u2019s case, I have considered the adjudicative process\nfactors listed in the Directive and AG \u00b6 2(a). I have also considered every finding of fact and\nconclusion discussed above. \nI considered the favorable character evidence, and the evidence presented from the forensic\npsychiatrist and Applicant\u2019s clinical psychologist. The psychiatrist testified he did not believe that\nas Applicant goes through treatment and addresses the problem, that he is at risk of doing something\nlike this again. He based that on Applicant\u2019s behavior pattern throughout his lifetime, and the fact\nthat he only did this once. He stated \u201cthe best predictor of behavior is previous behavior.\u201d21\nApplicant hacked into his former employer\u2019s system and shut down their phone system. That is an\ninexcusable action that reflected directly on Applicant\u2019s judgment, honesty, reliability,\ntrustworthiness, and willingness to comply with rules and regulations. Other than an actual security\nviolation, this is the type of action that causes the greatest concern, and is hopefully preventable\nthrough the security screening process. I agree with the psychiatrist that previous behavior is the best\npredictor of behavior. In this case, Applicant\u2019s previous behavior of hacking into his former\ncompany\u2019s system is so serious that it would be imprudent to grant Applicant a security clearance.\nTo do so would risk Applicant committing similar behavior, with grave implications to national\nsecurity, because this time we would have given him access to classified information or systems. The\nacceptance of such a risk would not be clearly consistent with the national interest. \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions and evaluating all the evidence\nin the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has mitigated the security concerns based\non his personal conduct. He has not mitigated the security concerns based on his use of information\ntechnology systems. \nFORMAL FINDINGS\nThe following are my conclusions as to each allegation in the SOR:\nParagraph 1.  Guideline E:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2.  Guideline M:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\n\n9\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.

Applicant requested that the case be decided on the written record.  On January 23,\n2008, after considering the record, Administrative Judge Henry Lazzaro denied Applicant\u2019s request\nfor a security clearance.  Applicant filed a timely appeal pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.28 and\nE3.1.30.\nApplicant raises the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s finding that Applicant\nhad failed to list a 2005 conviction on his security clearance application (SCA) was error.  We also\nconstrue Applicant\u2019s appeal as claiming that the Judge\u2019s adverse security clearance decision is\narbitrary, capricious, and contrary to law.  Finding no error, we affirm.  \nThe Judge made the following pertinent findings of fact:  Applicant has been employed as\na simulator technician at an Army base.  He has possessed a secret clearance since 1984.\nApplicant has been charged with with DUI four times\u2013in 1982, 1987, 1999, and 2000.

Applicant listed the offenses which had occurred prior to his 2003\nSOR but did not list the 2005 offense.\n The Board has examined the challenged finding and concludes that it is based upon\nsubstantial record evidence.

Part of Applicant\u2019s response to the Government\u2019s file of relevant\nmaterial (FORM) was to show that some of his offenses had been expunged from his record.  The\nJudge stated that Applicant had provided no reason to believe that he was factually innocent of the\nexpunged offenses; consequently, the Judge properly considered them in evaluating Applicant\u2019s\nsecurity concerns.  In addition, the Judge concluded that Applicant\u2019s denial of a deceitful intent in\nfailing to list his 2005 incident on the SCA was not credible.  Examined in light of the entire record,\nthe Judge\u2019s decision articulates \u201ca satisfactory explanation for [his] conclusions, including a rational\nconnection between the facts found\u201d and his adverse decision.

Applicant\nsubmitted an undated response to the SOR that had been notarized on August 6, 2007.\nHe admitted all SOR allegations except subparagraph 2.a, and provided various\nexplanations and clarifications to many of the allegations to which he admitted.

See, e.g., DISCR Case No. 86-3543\nat 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 27,1989). Accordingly, the doctrine of res judicata does not bar an adverse security\nclearance decision when an applicant has engaged in misconduct subsequent to a favorable clearance\ndecision.

Applicant submitted a response to the FORM that was received\nby DOHA on November 27, 2007. Applicant\u2019s response was forwarded to Department\nCounsel on November 28, 2007. Department Counsel indicated he did not object to\nApplicant\u2019s submission. The case was assigned to me on November 30, 2007.\nProcedural Ruling\nMotion to Amend SOR\nDepartment Counsel moved to amend the last sentence of subparagraph 2.a of the\nSOR by deleting the letter \u201ca\u201d from the phrase \u201c1.a through 1.f\u201d and substituting therefore\nthe letter \u201cb.\u201d Applicant did not respond to the motion to amend. In accordance with DoD\nDirective 5220.6, Enclosure 3, Additional Procedural Guidance, Paragraph E3.1.17, that\nmotion is granted and the change has been made on the face of the SOR.\n \nFindings of Fact\nApplicant\u2019s admissions to the allegations in the SOR are incorporated herein. In\naddition, after a thorough review of the pleadings and exhibits, I make the following findings\nof fact:\nApplicant is a 44-year-old man who has been employed as a simulator technician\nat an Army base by a succession of three defense contractors since January 1984. He was\nmarried in July 1986, and that marriage ended in divorce in January 1998. He has two\nchildren from that marriage, ages 20 and 15. Applicant attended college between 1986 and\n1988, but did not earn a degree.\nApplicant has possessed a secret level security clearance since 1984. An SOR was\nissued on July 25, 2003, seeking to revoke that security clearance. The 2003 SOR alleged\nthe same incidents as are alleged in the current SOR as subparagraphs 1.b through 1.h,\nas well as other allegations that are not contained in the current SOR. On December 3,\n2003, a hearing was held on the 2003 SOR. The administrative judge who presided over\nthat hearing issued a decision on March 18, 2004, in which she found for Applicant on all\nallegations.  \n2 3\n\n3\nApplicant was convicted of Driving Under the Influence (DUI) on December 22,\n1982, placed on one-year probation, fined, and sentenced to serve 30 days in jail\n(suspended). In a January 1985 statement, Applicant admitted failing a breath test after\nhe was arrested, but claimed he had only consumed a few beers. He was next convicted\nof DUI on June 22, 1987. This time he was sentenced to serve 11 months and 29 days\nconfinement (all but 10 days suspended), fined and ordered to complete an alcohol\nprogram. Applicant indicated he could not remember the details of this offense in a\nstatement he provided in April 2002. Applicant has consistently attributed these offenses,\nand a third alcohol-related offense that occurred overseas and is not alleged in the SOR,\nto youthful indiscretion.\nApplicant was again charged with DUI on August 7, 1999. In his April 2002\nstatement, Applicant admitted he consumed six or more 12 ounce beers before he was\narrested, failed a field sobriety test, and refused a breath test. The DUI charge was\nreduced to Reckless Driving and Applicant was sentenced to serve six months in jail (all\nbut two days suspended), fined, ordered to complete an alcohol program, and had his\ndriving privileges suspended. Applicant was next convicted of DUI in June 2000. He was\nagain sentenced to serve 11 months and 29 days confinement with the sentence converted\nto reporting probation after he served two actual days of confinement. He was also fined\nand ordered to attend DUI school. In his April 2002 statement, Applicant admitted he\nconsumed six or more beers, was drunk, and was involved in a minor auto accident before\nhe was arrested for this offense. He again refused a breath test. Applicant attributes these\noffenses to the stress caused by the dissolution of his marriage. \nIn July 2001, Applicant was charged with driving on a revoked license and having\nan open container of alcohol in his vehicle. He was convicted of Failure to Exhibit a driver\u2019s\nlicense and fined. In his April 2002 statement and in his response to the July 2003 SOR,\nApplicant claimed the open container was in the vehicle because he had consumed a beer\nwhile packing for a camping trip and had left the empty can in the vehicle. \nThe above incidents were all alleged in the July 2003 SOR. In response to that SOR\nApplicant asserted: \u201cI have since settled down and have had no incidents after (1.e) 2001.\nI have aso [sic] quit drinking alcohol alltogether [sic].\u201d (Item 5) At the December 2003\nhearing held on the SOR, Applicant testified he consumed alcohol after the 2001 incident,\nbut only on weekends. (Item 6, pg. 37) He also testified he last consumed alcohol the prior\nsummer and did not want to drink alcohol in the future. (Item 6, pg. 43)\nApplicant attended a ten-hour DUI class in 1983 as a result of his 1982 conviction,\nand an alcohol education program in 2000 as a result of his 1999 conviction. He obtained\na psychological diagnosis prior to the December 2003 hearing and presented the testimony\nof the psychologist at the hearing. The psychologist opined that although Applicant\nacknowledged past problems with alcohol abuse he did not meet the diagnostic criteria for\nthat diagnosis at that time. That opinion was based in part on Applicant\u2019s self-report of six\nmonths of abstinence. The psychologist recommended Applicant remain abstinent in the\nfuture.\nApplicant was charged with public intoxication on March 30, 2005. He was convicted\nof this offense on April 6, 2005, and fined $25. Applicant provided a statement about this\n\n ISCR Case No. 96-0277 (July 11, 1997) at p. 2.\n4\n ISCR Case No. 97-0016 (December 31, 1997) at p. 3; Directive, Enclosure 3, Item E3.1.14. \n5\n Department of the Navy v.

He stopped to buy\na six pack of beer but, according to his statement, was refused service because he had left\nhis driver\u2019s license in his car. He was confronted by police in the parking lot and assumed\nthe clerk in the store had called them. The arresting officer observed Applicant was\nunsteady on his feet, had a strong odor (presumably of alcohol) about him, and could not\nfollow instructions on at least two of the field sobriety tests that were administered at the\ntime of his arrest.\nApplicant executed and submitted a security clearance application (SF 86) on\nJanuary 31, 2006. In response to question 24, inquiring about alcohol related offenses, he\nlisted all offenses that had been adjudicated during the 2003 hearing. However, he failed\nto list the 2005 public intoxication conviction. Applicant claimed in his responses to the\ncurrent SOR and to the FORM that the omission was unintentional because he thought he\nwas only being asked to update contact and personal information.   \n \nPOLICIES\nThe Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when evaluating a\nperson\u2019s eligibility to hold a security clearance. Chief among them are the disqualifying\nconditions and mitigating conditions for each applicable guideline. Additionally, each\nclearance decision must be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based upon the\nrelevant and material facts and circumstances, the whole person concept, and the factors\nlisted in \u00b6 6.3.1 through \u00b6 6.3.6 of the Directive. Although the presence or absence of a\nparticular condition or factor for or against clearance is not outcome determinative, the\nadjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against this\npolicy guidance. Considering the evidence as a whole, Guideline G (alcohol consumption)\nand Guideline E (personal conduct), with their respective disqualifying and mitigating\nconditions, are most relevant in this case. \n  \nThe sole purpose of a security clearance decision is to decide if it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for an\napplicant.  The government has the burden of proving controverted facts.  The burden of\n4\n5\nproof in a security clearance case is something less than a preponderance of evidence,6\nalthough the government is required to present substantial evidence to meet its burden of\nproof.  \u201cSubstantial evidence is more than a scintilla, but less than a preponderance of the\n7\n\n ISCR Case No. 98-0761 (December 27, 1999) at p. 2.\n8\n ISCR Case No. 94-1075 (August 10, 1995) at pp. 3-4; Directive, Enclosure 3, Item E3.1.15.\n9\n ISCR Case No. 93-1390 (January 27, 1995) at pp. 7-8; Directive, Enclosure 3, Item E3.1.15.\n10\n Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, 531.\n11\n Id at 531.\n12\n Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive.\n13\n5\nevidence.\u201d  Once the government has met its burden, the burden shifts to an applicant to\n8\npresent evidence of refutation, extenuation, or mitigation to overcome the case against\nhim.  Additionally, an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable\n9\nclearance decision.10\nNo one has a right to a security clearance  and \u201cthe clearly consistent standard\n11\nindicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of\ndenials.\u201d   Any reasonable doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access\n12\nto classified information must be resolved in favor of protecting national security.      \n13\nAnalysis\nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption\nAlcohol consumption is a security concern because excessive alcohol consumption\noften leads to the exercise of questionable judgment, unreliability, failure to control\nimpulses, and increases the risk of unauthorized disclosure of classified information due\nto carelessness. Those who abuse alcohol are more likely than others to engage in high\nrisk, thoughtless, and sometimes violent behavior. Recurrent use of alcohol to the point of\nintoxication may affect an individual\u2019s ability to exercise the care, judgment, and discretion\nnecessary to protect classified information.\nAs alleged in the SOR, Applicant was convicted of DUI or other alcohol-related\noffenses in 1982, 1987, 1999, 2000 and 2001. He attended court-mandated alcohol\neducation programs in 1983 and 2000, and obtained an independent alcohol evaluation\nin 2003 in preparation for the hearing on the SOR issued that year. He was obviously made\naware of the security significance of the previous alcohol related offenses, and admitted\nto the psychologist who conducted the 2003 evaluation he felt he had an alcohol problem\nin the past. He was advised by that psychologist that he should remain alcohol abstinent\nin the future. He testified at the 2003 hearing he had not consumed alcohol for at least\nseveral months and did not want to consume alcohol in the future.\nStill, Applicant was charged with yet another alcohol-related offense in 2005. While\nthat charge itself and the fine imposed therefore are relatively minor, it must be noted the\n\n Applicant submitted proof that a number of the offenses of which he was convicted were later\n14\nexpunged from his arrest record and dismissed. There is no indication any of those actions were based upon\ndeterminations that Applicant did not commit the offenses of which he was charged and convicted and, thus,\nthey do not in anyway diminish the security significance of the arrests and convictions themselves.\n6\noffense occurred after Applicant admittedly drove an automobile in the obviously\nintoxicated condition as described in the arresting officer\u2019s report. Disqualifying Condition\n22(a): alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under the influence,\nfighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other incidents of concern,\nregardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol\ndependent applies.\nApplicant\u2019s history, at best, discloses two periods of excessive alcohol consumption,\nseparated by a number of years, that led to multiple arrests and convictions. Those\nconvictions were then followed by a somewhat isolated incident after Applicant was made\naware of the security significance of such misconduct.  Accordingly, I do not find\n14\nApplicant\u2019s excessive alcohol consumption and resulting misconduct is infrequent,\nmitigated by the passage of time or unlikely to recur. Further, Applicant has neither\nadmitted to a continuing alcohol problem nor has he taken positive steps to prevent a\nrecurrence. Therefore, no Guideline G mitigating condition applies and Guideline G is\ndecided against Applicant.\nGuideline E, Personal Conduct\nPersonal conduct is always a concern because conduct involving questionable\njudgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations\ncan raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful and candid\nanswers during the security clearance process or any failure to cooperate with the security\nclearance process.\nApplicant\u2019s explanation for not listing his 2005 arrest and the resulting conviction in\nthe 2006 SF 86 he submitted is not credible. A comparison of the 2006 SF 86 with the one\nhe submitted in 2000 discloses he did much more than merely update personal and\ncontact information. For example, a new employer is listed, a different person who knew\nhim well is listed, all offenses adjudicated at the 2003 hearing are listed in the 2006 SF 86\nas opposed to just the two that are listed in the 2000 SF86, and detailed general remarks\nare provided concerning the 2003 adjudication. Further, it is just not believable Applicant\nwould have taken the time and trouble to list the somewhat detailed information contained\nin the 2006 SF 86 about the offenses he knew the Government was aware of while\nomitting the one he could not know whether or not they aware of if he thought he was only\nupdating personal and contact information.\nDC 16(a): deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from\nany personal security questionnaire, personal history statement, of similar form used to\nconduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status,\ndetermine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities\n\n7\napplies. I have considered every Guideline E mitigating condition and conclude none apply.\nGuideline E is decided against Applicant.     \nThe objective of the security-clearance process is the fair-minded, commonsense\nassessment of a person\u2019s trustworthiness and fitness for access to classified information.\nIndeed, the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept recognizes we should view a person by the totality of\ntheir acts and omissions.\nEach case must be adjudged on its own merits, taking into\nconsideration all relevant circumstances, and applying sound judgment, mature thinking,\nand careful analysis.   \nConsidering all relevant and material facts and circumstances present in this case,\nthe whole person concept, the factors listed in \u00b6 6.3.1 through \u00b66.3.6 of the Directive, the\napplicable disqualifying conditions, Applicant has failed to mitigate the security concerns\ncaused by his alcohol consumption and personal conduct. He has failed to overcome the\ncase against him or satisfy his ultimate burden of persuasion. It is not clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant Applicant a security clearance. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as\nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline G:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a-I:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline E:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.\nClearance is denied.\n________________\nHenry Lazzaro\nAdministrative Judge\n\n",

She has not used any illegal substance\nsince 1999, and she stated that she will not use any illegal substance in the future. When Applicant\ncompleted a Security Clearance Application (SCA) in May 2004, she furnished to the Government\ninformation that was not completely accurate regarding her drug usage, but it was done inadvertently.\nMitigation hast been shown. Clearance is granted.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn February 22,  2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), under\nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry, dated February 20,\n1960, as amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial\nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended and\nmodified, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) (Item 1) to Applicant. The SOR detailed reasons\nunder Guideline H (Drug Involvement), and Guideline E (Personal Conduct) why DOHA could not\nmake the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant, and recommended referral\nto an Administrative Judge to conduct proceedings and determine whether clearance should be\ngranted or denied.\nIn a signed and sworn statement, dated March 13, 2007, Applicant responded to the SOR\nallegations (Item 3). She requested that her case be decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing.\nOn March 22, 2007, Department Counsel prepared the Department's written case. A complete copy\nof the File of Relevant Material (FORM) was provided to Applicant, and she was given the\nopportunity to file objections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation. Response\nwas due on May 2, 2007. Applicant did not submit a response to the FORM. The case was assigned\nto another Administrative Judge on June 14, 2007, but it was reassigned to this Administrative Judge\non September 5, 2007.\nIn the FORM, Department Counsel offered six documentary exhibits (Items 1-6),  which have\nbeen admitted without objection. Applicant offered no documentary evidence into the record. \nFINDINGS OF FACT\nThe Government opposes Applicant's request for a security clearance, based upon the\nallegations set forth in the SOR.  The SOR contains four allegations, 1.a. through 1.d., under\nGuideline H (Drug Involvement), and two allegation, 2.a. and 2.b., under Guideline E (Personal\nConduct). Applicant admitted SOR allegations 1.a. through 1.d., and she denied 2.a. and 2.b.. The\nadmitted allegations are incorporated herein as findings of fact. \nAfter a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, including Applicant's\nAnswer to the SOR and the admitted documents, and upon due consideration of that evidence, I\n\n3\nmake the additional findings of fact: \nApplicant is 56 years old. She is employed by a defense contractor, and she seeks a DoD\nsecurity clearance in connection with her employment in the defense sector.\nParagraph 1 (Guideline H - Drug Involvement) \nThe Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance because\nit states that she has used illegal substances. \n1.a.  Applicant used cocaine at various times during the period from 1968 to 1999. \n1.b.  Applicant used marijuana at various times during the period from 1968 to 1999. \n1.c.  At times, Applicant contributed her own money for the purchase of illegal drugs.\n1.d.  Applicant used cocaine and marijuana during the period from the period from 1985 to\n1999,  when she held a security clearance. \n \nApplicant stated in her RSOR that she last used any illegal substance in 1999, because of a\n\u201clife changing experience.\u201d  In her response to interrogatories, signed by Applicant on December 27,\n2006, (Item 6) she stated that she does not intend to use any illegal substance in the future.\nParagraph 2 (Guideline E - Personal Conduct) \nThe Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance because\nshe exhibited conduct involving questionable judgement, untrustworthiness, unreliability and\ndishonesty.\n2.a.  Applicant executed a signed  SCA on May 26, 2004. Question #27 asks,  \u201cSince the age\nof 16 or in the last 7 years, whichever is shorter, have you illegally used any controlled substance,\nfor example, marijuana, [etc.]?\u201d  Applicant answered \"No\" to this question.  She clearly should have\nlisted her use of cocaine and marijuana from 1968 until 1999, as alleged in paragraphs 1.a and  1.b.,\nabove. However, Applicant  did list her cocaine and marijuana usage from 1968 until 1995 on\nquestion  #28, the next question. Therefore, while Applicant did not list the correct year that she\nstopped using illegal substances, she did furnish a great deal of information about her illegal drug\nusage. Additionally on her RSOR, (Item 3) Applicant averred that when she completed her SCA, on\nMay 26, 2004, she incorrectly believed that June 1995 was the last date that she had used any illegal\nsubstance. \n2.b.  Question #28 of the SCA asks, Have you ever illegally used a controlled substance while\nemployed as a law enforcement officer, prosecutor, or courtroom official; while possessing a security\nclearance or while in a position directly of immediately affecting public safety?\u201d Applicant answered\n\"Yes\" to this question, and as stated above, she did list her cocaine and marijuana  usage from 1968\nuntil 1995. While she should have cited the dates from 1985, the date she first received her security\nclearance, until 1999, I find that Applicant made a good faith effort to provide the information\nrequested by the Government and there was no wilful misrepresentation on either of these questions.\n\n4\nPOLICIES\nSecurity clearance decisions are not made in a vacuum. Accordingly, the Department of\nDefense, in Enclosure 2 of the 1992 Directive, has set forth policy factors which must be given\n\"binding\" consideration in making security clearance determinations. These factors should be\nfollowed in every case according to the pertinent guideline. However, the factors are neither\nautomatically determinative of the decision in any case, nor can they supersede the Administrative\nJudge's reliance on his own common sense, as well as his knowledge of the law, human nature and\nthe ways of the world, in making a reasoned decision. \nIn addition, as set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive at pages 18-19, \"In evaluating the\nrelevance of an individual's conduct, the [Administrative Judge] should consider the following\nfactors [General Factors]:\na. The nature, extent and seriousness of the conduct\nb. The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation\nc. The frequency and recency of the conduct\nd. The individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct\ne. The voluntariness of participation\nf. The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavior changes\ng. The motivation for the conduct\nh. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress\ni. The likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nThe eligibility guidelines established in the DoD Directive identify personal characteristics\nand conduct which are reasonably related to the ultimate question of whether it is \"clearly consistent\nwith the national interest\" to grant an Applicant's request for access to classified information.\nIn the defense industry, the security of classified industrial secrets is entrusted to civilian\nworkers who must be counted upon to safeguard such sensitive information twenty-four hours a day.\nThe Government is therefore appropriately concerned where available information indicates that an\nApplicant for clearance may be involved in acts of alcohol abuse and conduct that demonstrates poor\njudgement, untrustworthiness or unreliability on the Applicant's part.\nThe DoD Directive states, \"Each adjudication is to be an overall common sense\ndetermination based upon consideration and assessment of all available information, both favorable\nand unfavorable, with particular emphasis placed on the seriousness, recency, frequency, and\nmotivation for the individual's conduct; the extent to which conduct was negligent, willful,\nvoluntary, or undertaken with the knowledge of the circumstances or consequences involved; and,\nto the extent that it can be estimated, the probability that conduct will or will not continue in the\nfuture.\" The Administrative Judge can only draw those inferences or conclusions that have a\nreasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record. The Judge cannot draw inferences or\nconclusions based on evidence which is speculative or conjectural in nature. Finally, as emphasized\nby President Eisenhower in Executive Order 10865, \"Any determination under this order...shall be\na determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the\n\n5\nloyalty of the applicant concerned.\"\nCONCLUSIONS\nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all appropriate legal\nprecepts, factors, and conditions, including those described briefly above, I conclude the following\nwith respect to the allegation set forth in the SOR:\nIt is the Government's responsibility to present substantial evidence to support the finding\nof a nexus, or rational connection, between Applicant's conduct and the continued holding of a\nsecurity clearance. If such a case has been established, the burden then shifts to the Applicant to go\nforward with evidence in rebuttal, explanation or mitigation which is sufficient to overcome or\noutweigh the Government's case. Applicant bears the ultimate burden of persuasion in proving that\nit is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him a security clearance.\nParagraph 1 (Guideline H - Drug Involvement) \nWith respect to Guideline H, the Government has established its case. Applicant's improper\nand illegal drug abuse, including the possession, and use of marijuana and cocaine is of concern,\nespecially while she was holding a security clearance, in light of her desire to have access to the\nnation's secrets. Applicant's overall conduct pertaining to her illegal substance abuse clearly falls\nwithin Drug Involvement Disqualifying Condition (DC) 25 (a), any drug abuse, (c), illegal drug\npossession, including cultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution, and (g),\nany illegal drug use after being granted a security clearance.\nBecause Applicant stated that she last used marijuana or cocaine in 1999, and she does not\nintend to use it again, I conclude that Applicant\u2019s conduct does comes within Mitigating Condition\n(MC) (a)., the drug involvement happened so long ago that it is unlikely to recur, and (b), a\ndemonstrated intent not to abuse drugs in the future because of (4) an appropriate period of\nabstinence. \nIn this case, the Government has met its initial burden of proving by substantial evidence that\nApplicant has used illegal drugs under Guideline H. However, Applicant has introduced persuasive\nevidence in rebuttal, explanation or mitigation which is sufficient to overcome the Government's\ncase against her.  Accordingly, Paragraph 1 Guideline H of the SOR is concluded for Applicant.\nParagraph 2 (Guideline E - Personal Conduct)  \nWith respect to Guideline E, the evidence establishes that Applicant provided incomplete and\nincorrect information to the Government in response to  questions  #27 and #28, on the SCA that she\nexecuted on May 26, 2004. However, Applicant did indicate that she had used cocaine and marijuana\nfor a period of 1968 to 1995, rather than 1999.  I conclude that when Applicant answered the SCA,\nshe did not knowingly provide untruthful information to the Government.\nWhile Applicant did exhibit  extremely poor judgement by her use of illegal substances for\nmany years, especially after she received a security clearance, there has now been a period of eight\nyears where Applicant has refrained from using any illegal substances. \n\n6\nIn reviewing the DCs under Guideline E,  I conclude that no DC applies because Applicant\ndid not deliberately provide false information in her SCA.  I resolve Paragraph 2 Guideline E for\nApplicant.\nParagraph 3 (Guideline J - Criminal Conduct)\nI conclude that since the incomplete  information that Applicant furnished to the Government\non the SCA was inadvertent, no criminal conduct was committed, and no Criminal Conduct DC\napplies to this case.\nOn balance, it is concluded that Applicant has overcome the Government's information\nopposing her request for a security clearance.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal findings For or Against the Applicant on the allegations in the SOR, as required by\nParagraph 25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1: FOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a.: For Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b.: For Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c.: For Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d.: For Applicant\nParagraph 2: For APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a.:  For  Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b.:  For Applicant\nParagraph 3: For APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 3.a.:  For  Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.\nMartin H.

He admitted allegations 2.e and 2.f. Based on these admissions, I find that he also admitted the allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.e and 1.f. He denied the factual allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.d and 2.d of the SOR.

His Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) criminal record report indicates that the police in City A arrested and charged him with felony fleeing, driving on a suspended license and possession of marijuana in 1985, when he was 21 years old. The record also reflects that no complaint was filed on the felony fleeing charge and contains no information on the remaining two charges. At the hearing, Applicant denied that he had been arrested in City A because he had lived in City B since 1969.

On December 28, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under Guidelines\nJ, G and E for Applicant. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865,\nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended;\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised\nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and\neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on January 17, 2008. He answered\nthe SOR in writing on January 20, 2008, and again on March 5, 2008. He requested a\nJune 27, 2008\n\nGE 1 (Applicant\u2019s security clearance application, dated February 23, 2006).\n1\nSOR at 1; GE 6 (United States Department of Justice, Federal Bureau of Investigation, Criminal Justice\n2\nInformation Services, dated March 16, 2006) at 2; Tr. 23-24, 48-49.\n2\nhearing before an administrative judge. DOHA received the request in March 2008.\nDepartment Counsel was prepared to proceed on April 17, 2008, and I received the\ncase assignment on April 21, 2008. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on May 9, 2008,\nand the Applicant received the hearing notice on May 13, 2008. I convened the hearing\nas scheduled on June 5, 2008. The government offered 19 exhibits (GE) 1 through 19,\nwhich were received and admitted into evidence without objection. Applicant testified on\nhis own behalf. He submitted one exhibit (AE) A, which was received and admitted into\nevidence without objection. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on June\n16, 2008. The record closed on June 5, 2008.\nFindings of Fact\nIn his Answers to the SOR, dated January 20, 2008 and March 5, 2008,\nApplicant alleged that \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 2.a and 2.b were the same, as were \u00b6\u00b6 1.j, 1.k, 2.g,\nand 2.h. He admitted allegations 2.e and 2.f. Based on these admissions, I find that he\nalso admitted the allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.e and 1.f. He denied the factual allegations in \u00b6\u00b6\n1.d and 2.d of the SOR. Concerning the remaining allegations, Applicant neither\nadmitted nor denied the allegations, although he provided some information on \u00b6\u00b6 1.c,\n1.g, 1.j., 1.k., 2.c, 2.g, 2.h, 3.a, and 3.b. I find these allegations denied.\nApplicant, who is 44 years old, works for a Department of Defense contractor as\na sodder. He began his current job in February 2006. He completed his security\nclearance application at the time he began his job.1\nApplicant began drinking as a young man. His Federal Bureau of Investigation\n(FBI) criminal record report indicates that the police in City A arrested and charged him\nwith felony fleeing, driving on a suspended license and possession of marijuana in\n1985, when he was 21 years old. The record also reflects that no complaint was filed on\nthe felony fleeing charge and contains no information on the remaining two charges. At\nthe hearing, Applicant denied that he had been arrested in City A because he had lived\nin City B since 1969. He, however, did not deny that he had been arrested on the\ncharges identified in the FBI records. He further agreed that he appeared in court in\nJune 1986 on these charges. The court dropped the speeding charge, but fined him $80\non the marijuana charge. He has not smoked marijuana in 13 years and last tried\ncocaine 10 years ago. Based on Applicant\u2019s credible testimony, I find that the\nallegations \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b are the same and are not alcohol-related.2\nIn March 1988, Applicant and a friend stopped at a restaurant and ordered pizza.\nWhile waiting outside for the pizza, they purchased a six-pack of beer and began\ndrinking the beer. After purchasing the pizza, they started to leave. The police stopped\nthem and gave them a ticket for drinking in public. Applicant has no memory of an arrest\n\nGE 4 (Interrogatories and Applicant\u2019s answers, dated October 9, 2007) at 2; GE 6, supra note 2, at 2-3; Tr.\n3\n25-26.\nTr. 26-27, 50.\n4\nGE 1, supra note 1, at 10-11, Tr. 21-22.\n5\nGE 4, supra note 3, at 2; GE 16 (Police report, dated February 15, 1998); GE 18 (Court record); Tr. 27-28,\n6\n52-56.\nGE 19 (Report of alcohol counseling program, dated September 21, 1998).\n7\n3\nin August 1988 for driving under the influence (DUI)- property damage. The government\nsubmitted no documents which establish this incident and it is not listed on the FBI\nreport.3\nIn November 1989, Applicant attended an evening party on the north side of town\nwhere he drank alcohol. On his way to his home on the south side of town, he stopped\nat a construction site to leave a friend, who was working nights, a meal. To reach the\nconstruction site, he drove down a street the wrong way, the only way he could\napproach the construction site. The police observed his conduct, then pulled him over.\nThe police ticketed him for DUI, DUI over.10% and driving the wrong way on a one-way\nstreet. He pled guilty to DUI and the court fined him.4\nApplicant married in 1994. He has a son from this marriage, who is 13 years old.\nHe and his wife, who is a police officer in City B, divorced in 1999. He and his wife have\njoint custody of their son, but she has primary physical custody.5\nIn 1998, while still married, Applicant began drinking at home while taking care of\nhis young son. After consuming the beer at home, he decided to drive to the store to\nbuy more beer. He put his 4-year-old son in the car and drove to the store. At some\npoint in time, an unknown female got in this car. He denies knowing her name or the\nreason she was in his car. The police stopped him; they arrested and charged him with\nchild abuse, a felony, DUI, and DUI with alcohol concentration .10 or more as his\nbreathalyzer results showed an alcohol level of .188. He pled guilty to criminal\nnegligence. The court sentenced him to one day in jail, then placed him on three years\nprobation, which was reduced to 18 months. The court also directed that he attend\nalcohol awareness training, alcohol counseling, and remain sober for two years.   \n6\nApplicant complied with the terms of his sentence, including remaining sober. He\nattended 36 hours of a level one alcohol counseling program. The program information\nsheet indicates that he admitted alcohol abuse, that he was cooperative and compliant,\nbut only minimally participated in the counseling sessions.7\nIn October 2002, Applicant\u2019s former wife refused to allow him his usual weekend\nvisit with his son because Applicant intended to pick up his son and drop his son at\nApplicant\u2019s mother\u2019s house, while Applicant went out for the evening. Later that evening,\n\nGE 15 (Police report, dated October 2002); GE 17 (Court record); Tr. 28-30, 56.\n8\nGE 12 (Police report, dated January 6, 2003); GE 13 (Court disposition record); Tr. 30-31, 56-58.\n9\nGE 14 (Counseling program report, dated June 28, 2003).\n10\nGE 10 (Police report, dated November 29, 2004); GE 11 (Court records); Tr. 32-33, 59.\n11\nGE 6, supra note 2, at 3; GE 7 (Police report, dated January 4, 2006) at 1; GE 8 (Court records, showing\n12\nsame police report number) at 1; Tr. 34-36. \n4\nApplicant observed his former wife at a bar. He learned that she had dropped their son\nat her mother\u2019s house for the evening. Applicant became angry. He called his former\nwife\u2019s house and left an obscene message on her answering machine. She filed a\ncomplaint against him. The police arrested and charged him with harassment in October\n2002. He pled guilty to this charge. Applicant denied alcohol was the reason for his\nconduct.  \n8\nOn January 16, 2003, Applicant started drinking early. He had not eaten when he\nand his brother decided to ride their motorcycles. The police observed a traffic violation\nand stopped them. The police charged him with unsafe lane change, following too\nclosely, DUI, extreme DUI, and DUI with BAC of more than.08. Applicant\u2019s breathalyzer\nresults revealed a blood alcohol content of .193. Applicant pled guilty to DUI and the\ncourt dismissed the remaining charges. The court sentenced him to 90 days in jail, with\n85 days suspended; placed him on 18 months probation; fined him approximately\n$1,400; and directed he attend alcohol counseling.  \n9\nApplicant complied with the terms of his sentence, including remaining sober for\n18 months. He attended 36 hours of alcohol counseling. The program noted his\nabstinence. It concluded that long-term sobriety would be difficult.10\nIn December 2004, Applicant attended a club with a friend. He drank three beers\nwhile watching a game. He and his friend left the club. On his way home, the police\nstopped him and charged him with failure to stop for a red light, improper right turn, DUI,\nand DUI more than .08. His breathalyzer test showed a blood alcohol of .082. At the\ncourt hearing in May 2005, the prosecutor dismissed these charges and the court\ndismissed a charge for violation of a promise to appear.11\nApplicant contends that the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.j, 1.k, 2.g, and 2.h. are the\nsame incident. The police report reflects that the police arrested Applicant on January 4,\n2006 for DUI, stop sign violation, failure to show driver\u2019s license, and DUI with BAC of\n.08 or more, not on January 5, 2005. The police report number is identical to the\nnumber listed on the FBI records report for the January 5, 2005. I find that the date on\nthe FBI report is a clerical error and that the above allegations are the same.12\nOn January 4, 2006, the arresting police officer smelled alcohol on Applicant\u2019s\nbreath when he stopped Applicant for traffic violations. The police officer sought to\n\nGE 7, supra note 12; GE 8, supra note 12; Tr. 34-37. \n13\nTr. 64-68.\n14\nGovernment Exhibit 1, supra note 2, at 1, 10-11.\n15\n5\nperform field sobriety tests and a breathalyzer test, which Applicant refused. The police\nobtained a warrant and drew Applicant\u2019s blood for testing. The results are not in the\nrecord. At a preliminary hearing, the court granted Applicant\u2019s motion to suppress, and\ndismissed all charges against Applicant without prejudice. The State has not re-filed the\ncharges against Applicant.  \n13\nAt the hearing, Applicant admitted that his drinking problem is that he drinks and\nhe wants to drink. He admitted that he sometimes shows questionable judgment when\ndrinking and cannot control his impulses all of the time. He does not participate in any\nalcohol counseling because he did not learn anything from the earlier sessions. He\ndoesn\u2019t drink when his son visits and may not drink for weeks. When he drinks, it may\nbe alone or with others.14\nApplicant completed his SF-86 on February 23, 2006. He answered \u201cno\u201d to the\nfollowing question:15\nQuestion 25. Your Use of Alcohol\n\u201cIn the last 7 years, has your use of alcoholic beverages I\nsuch as liquor, beer, wine) resulted in any alcohol-related\ntreatment or counseling (such as for alcohol abuse or\nalcoholism)?\u201d\nApplicant acknowledged that his answer to this question should have been \u201cyes\u201d.\nHe had no explanation for why he responded \u201cno\u201d.\nApplicant responded \u201cyes\u201d to the following question on his SF-86, but failed to list\nall his alcohol related arrests:\nQuestion 23. Your Police Record\nd. \u201cHave you ever been charged with or convicted of any offense(s)\nrelated to alcohol or drugs?\u201d\n    \nIn responding to this question, Applicant listed his 2001 arrest and his 1986\narrest, but did not list his arrests in 1988, 1989, 1998, 2003, 2004, and 2006. At the\nbeginning of the hearing, Applicant asked why he needed to list any arrests which had\nbeen dismissed. He did not understand the reason for listing the two arrests which had\nbeen dismissed by the courts or the prosecutor. Because the investigator asked him\nabout some of his alcohol-related arrests, he though he had listed them on the SF-86.\n\nGE 1, supra note 1, at 20-22; Tr. 14, 19-20, 39-47.\n16\nAE A (Letter, dated June 5, 2008).\n17\n6\nHe did list his 1998 DUI and alcohol counseling on his 2000 SF-86. He does not recall\nincidents which occurred 15 or 20 years ago.16\nApplicant\u2019s supervisor provided a favorable recommendation on his behalf. She\nstated that he is a dedicated, hard worker who takes pride in his work. He has strong\nproblem solving skills and is self-directed. He arrives to work on time every day as\nscheduled.17\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\n\n7\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk that the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct\nAG \u00b6 30 expresses the security concern pertaining to criminal conduct, \u201cCriminal\nactivity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. By its\nvery nature, it calls into question a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws,\nrules and regulations.\u201d\nAG \u00b6 31 describes conditions that could raise a security concern. The following\nconditions may be disqualifying:\n(a) a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses;\n(c) allegation or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the\nperson was formally charged, formally prosecuted or convicted;\nThe police arrested and charged Applicant with alcohol-related offenses on six\noccasions over a period of 18 years. The police also arrested him once for possession\nof marijuana and once for telephone harassment. The court dismissed two alcohol\narrests; however, the court convicted Applicant on the remaining offenses. The\ngovernment has not established that the arrest in SOR \u00b6 1.d relates to Applicant. Thus,\nthis allegation is found in favor of Applicant. In addition, the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a\nand 1.j are duplicative and are found in favor of Applicant.  Based on the remaining\nallegations in the SOR, Disqualifying Conditions 31 (a) and 31 (c) apply.\nUnder AG \u00b6 32, the following conditions could mitigate security concerns:\n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it\nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur\nand does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or\ngood judgment;\n(c) evidence that the person did not commit the offense; and\n\n8\n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited\nto the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or\nrestitution, job training or higher education, good employment record, or\nconstructive community involvement. \nEven though the prosecutor chose to withdraw the 2004 DUI charges against\nApplicant and the court dismissed the charges related to his January 2006 arrest, these\nfacts do not establish that Applicant did not commit these offenses. Applicant does not\ndeny driving after drinking on these occasions. Thus, Applicant has not established\nmitigation of the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.i and 1.k under AG \u00b6 32 (c).\nMore than 20 years ago, the police arrested Applicant for drug possession, his\nonly arrest for this criminal conduct. He ceased using drugs at least 10 years ago by his\nown choice. There is little likelihood that Applicant will use drugs in the future given his\nconscious decision. Applicant\u2019s telephone call to his former wife happened over six\nyears ago. His arrest and subsequent sentence led to his rethinking this particular\nconduct. He has not made any harassing telephone calls to his former wife and there is\nlittle likelihood he  will do this again. Applicant has mitigated the government\u2019s concerns\nregarding the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.g.\nFor the last 20 years, the police have arrested and charged Applicant with six\nalcohol -related offenses, including his drinking in public. Two offenses occurred nearly\n20 years ago; however, the fact that these offenses are old is not sufficient to establish\nmitigation because Applicant chose to continue drinking and driving, which resulted in\nfour more alcohol arrests, the last just two years ago. Applicant has not mitigated the\ngovernment\u2019s concerns about his drinking and driving conduct because the record\nshows a long history of this conduct. Given that Applicant continues to drink, there is a\nreal possibility he will be arrested in the future for DUI.\nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption\nAG \u00b6 21 expresses the security concern pertaining to alcohol consumption,\n\u201cExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment or\nthe failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about an individual's reliability\nand trustworthiness.\u201d\nUnder AG \u00b6 22, the following disqualifying conditions could raise a security\nconcern in this case:\n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under\nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or\nother incidents of concern, regardless of whether the individual is\ndiagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent;\n\n9\n(c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired\njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol\nabuser or alcohol dependent; and\n(d) diagnosis by a duly qualified medical professional (e.g., physician,\nclinical psychologist, or psychiatrist) of alcohol abuse or alcohol\ndependence;\n(e) evaluation of alcohol abuse or alcohol dependence by a licensed\nclinical social worker who is a staff member of a recognized alcohol\ntreatment program;\nApplicant received five DWIs for driving after drinking and the police arrested him\nonce for drinking in public. Except for the arrests in 1998 and 2003, he continued to\ndrink and drive. He still consumes alcohol, but not on a daily basis. The record does not\ncontain any evidence that shows a diagnosis of alcohol abuse or alcohol dependent. A\nsecurity concern is raised under the disqualifying conditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 22 (a) and (c).\nBecause Applicant cannot remember anything about the 1988 DUI arrest and could\nremember some information about his other DUI arrests, the government has not\nestablished the allegation in SOR \u00b6 2.b. As SOR \u00b6 2.g is the same as \u00b6 2.h, I find this\nallegation in favor of Applicant.\nAG \u00b6 23 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns:\n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it\nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or\ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness,\nor good judgment;\n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her alcoholism or issues of alcohol\nabuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and\nhas established a pattern of abstinence (if alcohol dependent) or\nresponsible use (if an alcohol abuser);\n(c) the individual is a current employee who is participating in a counseling\nor treatment program, has no history of previous treatment and relapse,\nand is making satisfactory progress; and,\n(d) the individual has successfully completed inpatient or outpatient\ncounseling or rehabilitation along with any required aftercare, has\ndemonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or\nabstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations, such as\nparticipation in meetings of Alcoholics Anonymous or a similar\norganization and has received a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified\nmedical professional or a licensed clinical social worker who is a staff\nmember of a recognized alcohol treatment program.\n\nSee ISCR Case No. 03-09483 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov.17, 2004)(explaining holding in ISCR Case No. 02-23133\n18\nat 5 (App. Bd. Jun. 9, 2004)).\n10\n \nApplicant continues to consume alcohol although not on a daily basis. His last\nDUI arrest occurred two years ago and reflects a 20-year pattern of drinking and driving.\nWhile he attended two court ordered alcohol counseling sessions, he does not currently\nparticipate any counseling program, despite a recommendation that he do so by the\ncounselor in 2003. He likes to drink and intends to drink in the future even though he\nacknowledges he sometimes shows questionable judgment when drinking and cannot\nalways control his impulses when he has been drinking. The Applicant has not mitigated\nthe government\u2019s concerns about his alcohol consumption  under AG  \u00b6 23.\nGuideline E, Personal Conduct\nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern pertaining to personal conduct::\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful\nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other\nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\nAG \u00b6 16(a) describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be\ndisqualifying:\n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from\nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or\nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment\nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance\neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities;\nThe government established that Applicant omitted material facts from his SF-86\nwhen he answered \u201cno\u201d to the question Section 25 about his past counseling for alcohol\nconsumption and when he failed to list all his alcohol arrests after answering \u201cyes\u201d to\nquestion d in Section 23. This information is material to the evaluation of Applicant\u2019s\ntrustworthiness to hold a security clearance and to his honesty. For this guideline to\napply, Applicant\u2019s omission must be deliberate. He denies, however, that he deliberately\nfalsified his answer to these questions. When a falsification allegation is controverted,\nthe government has the burden of proving it. Proof of an omission, standing alone, does\nnot establish or prove an applicant\u2019s intent or state of mind when the omission occurred.\nAn administrative judge must consider the record evidence as a whole to determine\nwhether there is direct or circumstantial evidence concerning an applicant\u2019s intent or\nstate of mind at the time the omission occurred.  For DC \u00b6 16 (a) to apply, the\n18\ngovernment must establish that Applicant\u2019s omission, concealment or falsification in his\nanswer was deliberate.\n\nThe other potential mitigating conditions listed under AG \u00b6 17 are not applicable in this case.\n19\n11\nAt the time he completed his SF-86, Applicant knew he had been arrested for\nDUI, public drinking and telephone harassment. Because his last two DUI cases had\nbeen dismissed by the courts, he erroneously assumed that he did not need to list them.\nHis erroneous assumption is insufficient to establish a deliberate intent to hide these\ntwo DUI arrests. However, Applicant\u2019s failure to list any of his DUI\u2019s coupled with his\nfailure to admit he attended alcohol counseling in 1998 and 2003 must be considered\nan attempt to hide the alcohol-related problems, particularly since his problems caused\nby his drinking continued. The disqualifying condition raised by AG \u00b6 16 (a) applies.\nUnder AG \u00b6 17, the following conditions could mitigate the government\u2019s security\nconcerns:\n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is\nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is\nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability,\ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; and\n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate\nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress.19\nIn his 2000 security clearance application, Applicant acknowledged his 1998\narrest and court ordered alcohol counseling. If this were his only alcohol-related arrest\nand only alcohol counseling in the last 10 years, mitigation would be possible because\nof the passage of time and the small likelihood of reoccurrence. However, in the last five\nyears, he has been arrested three more times for DUI and attended an alcohol\ncounseling program for the second time. He continues to drink, an activity which has the\npotential for more arrests. He candidly admits that his drinking can impair his judgment.\nHe has not mitigated the government\u2019s security concerns.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n\n12\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant\u2019s problems with the police\nbegan 20 years ago and are the result of his decision to consume alcohol. He abstains\nfrom drinking when his son visits. His drinking does not impact his work performance,\nhis reliability, or his attendance. However, he has shown a pattern of conduct over the\nlast 20 years, which will continue because he still wants to drink. He knows his drinking\ncan affect his judgment, especially about driving. There is a likelihood that he will be\narrested again for DUI. He has not mitigated the government\u2019s concerns about his\nalcohol use and its impact on his life.\nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s\neligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude\nApplicant has not mitigated the security concerns arising from his alcohol consumption,\ncriminal conduct, and personal conduction. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline J:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.i:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.j:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.k:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline G:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.e:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.f:\nAgainst Applicant\n\n13\nSubparagraph 2.g:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.h:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.i:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.j:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 3, Guideline E:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 3.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 3.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.

BRESLIN\nAPPEARANCES\nFOR GOVERNMENT\nNichol L. Noel, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nSYNOPSIS\nApplicant is a field engineer for a federal contractor, and has worked for federal contractors\nin a variety of positions since at least 1998.  He neglected to pay numerous debts following several\n\n2\nmoves, accumulating over $23,000.00 in delinquent debts.  Applicant failed to mitigate the security\nconcerns arising from his history of financial difficulties.  Clearance is denied.\n\n3\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn December 2, 2005, Applicant submitted an application for a security clearance.  The\nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a security clearance\nfor Applicant under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry\n(Feb. 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel\nSecurity Clearance Review Program (Jan. 2, 1992) (the \u201cDirective\u201d), as amended; and the new\nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and implemented\nby the Department of Defense on September 1, 2006.  On February 2, 2007, DOHA issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its decision: security concerns raised under the\nDirective, Guideline F, Financial Considerations.  \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on February 27, 2007.  He elected to have the matter\ndecided without a hearing.\nDepartment Counsel submitted the government\u2019s case in a File of Relevant Material (FORM)\ndated April 19, 2007.  On April 20, 2007, Department Counsel mailed a complete copy of the FORM\nto Applicant, along with notice of his opportunity to file objections and submit material to refute,\nextenuate, or mitigate the potentially disqualifying conditions.  Applicant received the FORM on\nMay 7, 2007.  Applicant did not submit any additional matter for consideration within 30 days.  The\ncase was assigned to me on July 19, 2007. \nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant denied the allegations in paragraphs 1.c, 1.h, and 1.m, but admitted the remaining\nfactual allegations in the SOR, with explanations.  (Item 2.)  Those admissions are incorporated\nherein as findings of fact.  He denied that the debts are sufficient to raise security concerns.  After\na complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, I make the following additional\nfindings of fact.\nApplicant is 35 years old.  (Item 4 at 1.)  He is a field engineer for a defense contractor\ncurrently working overseas.  (Id. at 2.)  \nHe has worked for federal contractors in a variety of positions requiring security clearances.\n(Item 4 at 2-3, 8.)  Between 1998 and 2003, Appellant worked for a defense contractor in his home\nstate.  (Item 4 at 2-3.)  He then moved to another position with the company in another state, where\nhe worked from August 2003 until August 2004, when he moved to his present position overseas.\n(Id.)  During this period, he also worked temporarily at other locations.\nIn December 2005, Applicant completed an SF 86, Security Clearance Application.  (Item\n4.)  He reported an outstanding delinquency for his company credit card.  (Item 4 at 9.)  Thereafter,\nsecurity investigators obtained a credit bureau report dated March 16, 2006.  (Item 8.)  The credit\nbureau report indicated Applicant had 14 delinquent debts totaling more than $23,000.00, including\na judgment for unpaid utility services and a state tax lien.  \n\n4\nOn February 2, 2007, DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons, listing 13 debts reported as\ndelinquent.  (Item 1.)  Applicant\u2019s response addressed each allegation in order.  He admitted each\nof the allegations, with explanations, except paragraphs 1.c, 1.h, and 1.m.  (Item 2.)  He indicated\nhe moved from his home state in 2003, and lived in several locations since that time, including\noverseas.  He stated many of the delinquent accounts were unpaid final bills for utilities and services,\nwhich had gone \u201cunnoticed\u201d because of his many moves.  He stated creditors had not attempted to\ncollect on these debts.  He never provided a change of address notice to his creditors because his new\naddresses were not established for months after each move.  \nApplicant resolved the debt listed in paragraph 1.e, his employer-issued credit card, and\nprovided a letter indicating it was settled for less than the asserted balance.  (Answer to SOR, at 4.)\nHe stated he was disputing the allegation in paragraphs 1.c, 1.h, and 1.m, but provided no\ndocumentation of this dispute. \nWith regard to the remaining debts, he stated he contacted the creditors to arrange repayment\nagreements.  However, he provided no evidence of any completed agreements, nor did he provide\nproof of any payments toward such agreements.\nPOLICIES\nThe President has \u201cthe authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national\nsecurity and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position \u2026\nthat will give that person access to such information.\u201d  Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S.\n518, 527 (1988).  In Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry\n(Feb. 20, 1960), the President set out guidelines and procedures for safeguarding classified\ninformation within the executive branch. \nTo be eligible for a security clearance, an applicant must meet the security guidelines\ncontained in the Directive.  Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth personnel security guidelines, as\nwell as the disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions under each guideline.  Conditions that\ncould raise a security concern and may be disqualifying, as well as those which could mitigate\nsecurity concerns pertaining to this adjudicative guideline, are set forth and discussed in the\nconclusions below.\n\u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make\nan affirmative determination that the person is eligible for a security clearance.\u201d  (AG, \u00b6 2.)  An\nadministrative judge must apply the \u201cwhole person concept,\u201d and consider and carefully weigh the\navailable, reliable information about the person.  (Id.)  An administrative judge should consider the\nfollowing factors: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances\nsurrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of\nthe conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which\nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral\nchanges; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  (Id.) \n\n5\nInitially, the government must present evidence to establish controverted facts in the SOR\nthat disqualify or may disqualify the applicant from being eligible for access to classified\ninformation.  (Directive, \u00b6 E3.1.14.)  Thereafter, the applicant is responsible for presenting evidence\nto rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts.  (Directive, \u00b6 E3.1.15.)  An applicant \u201chas the\nultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or\ncontinue his security clearance.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002).  \u201cAny\ndoubt as to whether access to classified information is clearly consistent with national security will\nbe resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d  (Directive, \u00b6 E2.2.2.)\nA person granted access to classified information enters into a special relationship with the\ngovernment.  The government must be able to repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those\nindividuals to whom it grants access to classified information.  The decision to deny an individual\na security clearance is not a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  (Exec. Ord. 10865, \u00a7\n7.)  It is merely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President has\nestablished for issuing a clearance.\nCONCLUSIONS\nI considered carefully all the facts in evidence and the legal standards discussed above.  I\nreach the following conclusions regarding the allegations in the SOR.\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set out in \u00b6 18\nof the new adjudicative guidelines.  \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial\nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to\nabide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s\nreliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information.  An individual\nwho is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to\ngenerate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns.  Under \u00b6 19(a), an\n\u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts\u201d is potentially disqualifying.  Similarly, under  \u00b6 19(c),\n\u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d may raise security concerns.  Appellant has been\ndelinquent on many accounts for many years, and has not shown that he is presently able to resolve\nthese debts.  The evidence raises these potentially disqualifying conditions.\nThe guideline also includes several conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising\nfrom financial difficulties.  Paragraph 20(a) may apply where \u201cthe behavior happened so long ago,\nwas so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast\ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d  The behavior in\nquestion is the non-payment of debts.  Most of the listed debts remain unresolved, therefore the\nbehavior is recent.  Moreover, it involves numerous debts arising at different times from divers areas.\nThe available evidence indicates a pattern of leaving unpaid debts when moving to a new location,\n\n6\nand Appellant provided no information to suggest this is unlikely to recur.  I conclude this potentially\nmitigating condition does not apply.\nUnder \u00b6 20(b), it may be mitigating where \u201cthe conditions that resulted in the financial\nproblem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn,\nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual acted\nresponsibly under the circumstances.\u201d  Appellant\u2019s financial problems arose because he failed to pay\nhis bills when he moved from one location to the next.  This was not a circumstance beyond his\ncontrol; therefore, I find this mitigating condition does not apply.\nEvidence that \u201cthe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there\nare clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control\u201d is potentially mitigating\nunder \u00b6 20(c).  Similarly, \u00b6 20(d) applies where the evidence shows \u201cthe individual initiated a good-\nfaith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.\u201d  Appellant provided no evidence\nthat he has obtained financial counseling.  He indicated his intention to negotiate repayment\nagreements; however, in the absence of more substantial evidence, I cannot find his financial\nproblems are under control or that he has made a good faith effort to resolve these debts.  These\npotentially mitigating conditions do not apply.\nParagraph 20(e) provides that it may be mitigating where \u201cthe individual has a reasonable\nbasis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides\ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions to resolve\nthe issue.\u201d  Appellant asserted he intends to dispute three of the listed debts, but provided no proof\nsupporting the basis of his dispute, or evidence of actions taken to resolve the issues.  I find this\nmitigating condition does not apply. \nWhole Person Concept\nI considered carefully all the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in this case\nin light of the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept, keeping in mind that any doubt as to whether access to\nclassified information is clearly consistent with national security must be resolved in favor of the\nnational security.  The documentary evidence and Applicant\u2019s admissions reveal serious, recurring\nfinancial difficulties, extending over many years. Unfortunately, Applicant provided little\ninformation about his background, character, or record of service, other than his employment with\na federal contractor for several years.  Other than evidence of the repayment of one bill, he provided\nno information demonstrating rehabilitation of his financial condition or other pertinent behavioral\nchanges.  He has not provided information from which I could assess the likelihood of a continuation\nof these financial concerns.  Considering all the evidence, I conclude Applicant has not met his\nburden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him a security\nclearance. \n\n7\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nMy conclusions as to each allegation in the SOR are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a-m:\nAgainst Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.\nClearance is denied.\nMichael J.

Since 2000, she accumulated\n\n1\nOn August 30, 2006, the Under Secretary of Defense (Intelligence) published a memorandum directing application of\nrevised Adjudicative Guidelines to all adjudications and other determinations made under the Directive and Regulation,\nin which the SOR was issued on or after September 1, 2006.  A memorandum from the Deputy Under Secretary of\nDefense (Counterintelligence and Security) to Director of DOHA, dated November 19, 2004, states DOHA shall utilize\nprovision of the Directive to resolve contractor cases involving trustworthiness determinations.\nFOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY\nWhen unredacted this document contains information\nEXEMPT FROM MANDATORY DISCLOSURE under the FOIA\nExemption 6 applies\n2\nnumerous debts listed in the Statement of Reasons (SOR), some of which she has resolved or paid.\nShe failed to list the outstanding financial obligations on her Public Trust Application.  She mitigated\nthe concerns raised by financial considerations and personal conduct.  Eligibility for a public trust\nposition is granted.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn March 28, 2005, Applicant submitted a Public Trust Position Application (SF-85) for an\nADP I/II/III position.  On March 7, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant under Department of Defense Directive 5220.6,\nDefense Industrial Security Clearance Review Program (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as\namended and revised.   The SOR alleged trustworthiness concerns under Guideline F (Financial\n1\nConsiderations) and Guideline E (Personal Conduct), and detailed reasons why DOHA recommends\nthe case be referred to an administrative judge to determine whether eligibility for a position of trust\nshould be granted.\nIn an answer dated March 30, 2007, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations and\nrequested a hearing.  On April 23, 2007, the case was assigned to me.  On May 15, 2007, a Notice\nof Hearing was issued, setting the case for hearing on June 4, 2007.  At the hearing, Department\nCounsel submitted four Government Exhibits (GX) that were marked and admitted into the record\nas GE 1-4 without objection.  Applicant submitted four exhibits that were marked and admitted into\nthe record as Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AX) A-D.  Applicant testified and called one witness.  \nThe record was held open until June14, 2007, to give Applicant time to submit additional\ndocuments.  On June 12, 2007, I extended that deadline to June 18, 2007, without objection from\nDepartment Counsel.  Applicant submitted additional evidence on June 18, 2007, which I marked\nas AX E and admitted into evidence without objection.  On June 14, 2007, DOHA received the\nhearing transcript (Tr.).\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nBased on the entire record, including Applicant\u2019s admissions in her answer to the SOR and\nat the hearing, I make the following additional findings of fact:\n\nWhile a student loan is in forbearance, a student is required to pay interest only.\n2\n3\nApplicant is 37 years old and presently separated from her second husband.  Since December\n2004, she has worked as a patient advocate for a medical center that administers health care benefits\nfor the federal government.  She was promoted in September 2006.  From April 3 to June 6, 2007,\nshe was off work due to a medical disability.  Prior to her current job, she worked for other health\ncare institutions and financial instituitions in customer services.  (GX A).\nApplicant attends junior college where she is pursuing a degree in human resources.  She\ninitially enrolled in college in 1988.  She attended until 1996.  She resumed her studies in January\n2007.  While in school previously, she obtained an educational loan in 1993 and one in 1994.  (AX\nE at 6).  After leaving school in 1996, both loans were placed in forbearance for various periods of\ntime and were unpaid at other times.   (AX E at 16; 18).  The loans total about $35,000.  (Tr. 71).\n2\nShe paid $360 per month on the loans from March to December 2006.  (Tr. 64).  They are currently\nin forbearance status until September 2007.  (AX E at 34).  She would not be able to attend school\nif her payments were not current.  (Tr. 69). \nApplicant\u2019s financial difficulties began sometime in 1999, when she left her first husband\nand did not have sufficient funds to manage her bills, including medical expenses.  She was\nsubsequently unemployed for four or five months.  (Tr. 52-54).  In July 2004, she remarried.  Her\nfinancial problems continued because her current husband quit his job and she was sick periodically\nfrom that time to the present.  (Tr. 54-55).  According to credit reports, dated June 2005, December\n2006, and February 2007, her delinquent debts began accruing in 2000.  (GX 2, 3 and 4). \nIn March 2007, the Government filed a SOR and alleged in Paragraph 1 (\u00b6 \u00b6 1.a through 1.v)\nthat Applicant owed 22 delinquent debts, totaling $42,715, of which $33,872 represented student\nloans.  Applicant admitted that she owed all of the delinquent debts listed in the SOR, except the\n$1,820 listed in \u00b6 1.v, which she has disputed, and claimed some of the listed student loans are\ninaccurate and duplicate accounts.  She admitted that she had not contacted all of the creditors to-\ndate.  Subsequent to the hearing, she spoke to a credit counselor and will enter into a repayment plan\nfor the unpaid debts.

Prior to its submission, she\ncompleted a SF-85P Worksheet in January.   In her response to the Question 19: Your Financial\n4\nRecord-Bankruptcy, Liens, Judgments, she recorded a judgment that she paid in 2000.  (AX A).\nHowever, when she submitted the e-QIP in March 2005 and in May 2005, she failed to note that\njudgment under the question.  At the time she completed the worksheet in January, she was unaware\nof the outstanding judgment noted in \u00b6 1.p and the debts listed in \u00b6\u00b6 1.q through 1.v.  The debts listed\nin SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.k, 1.l, 1.m, 1.n and 1.o, included a medical bill and her student loans, all of which she\ndid not believe were delinquent at the time.  (Tr. 49-52; 60-63; 68-69).  In October 2006, she became\naware of some of the delinquent debts because she was applying for a mortgage and reviewed her\ncredit report.  (Tr. 65).  She had not looked at her credit report since 2000 when she was divorced,\nand did not receive her mail after leaving her first husband.  (Tr. 66-67).\nWhile on disability for two months, Applicant received approximately $1,200 per month.\nOut of it, she paid her expenses and some money on her debts.  When she returns to work full time\nin June, she will have a net income of $1,800, leaving her additional monies to continue resolving\n\n5\noutstanding debts.  (Tr. 74).  Presently, she does not have any credit cards or loans other than her\nstudent loan that remains in forbearance while she attends school.  She paid off a car loan in 2006.\n(Tr. 73). She believes her outstanding debt is about $5,000 (not including her student loans).  (Tr.\n71).  Since starting her current job, she has not incurred any additional delinquent debts.  (Tr. 75).\nShe submitted a budget on June, 18, 2007.  (AX E at 34).  \nApplicant testified candidly about her financial problems and acknowledged her\nresponsibility to continue resolving her debts.  She intends to pay all of her obligations.  (Tr. 69).\nSubsequent to meeting with an investigator in May 2006, she continued paying on her student loan\nand resolved a couple debts.  (Tr. 59).  She believes her financial situation has improved since\nDecember 2006.  (Tr. 76).  She appears to be committed to obtaining financial stability. \nApplicant\u2019s sister testified as a character witness.  She believes Applicant is a very\nresponsible individual, who takes her obligations seriously.  (Tr. 80).  Applicant also submitted two\nmemorandums from the commanding officer of the U.S. Army\u2019s medical facility where she works.\nBoth of the documents compliment Applicant on her professional performance and dedication to the\nhospital. (AX C).\nPOLICIES\nIn an evaluation of an applicant\u2019s suitability for a public trust position, an administrative\njudge must consider the \u201cAdjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to\nClassified Information\u201d (Guidelines), which set forth adjudicative guidelines.  In addition to brief\nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines are divided into\nDisqualifying Conditions (DC), and Mitigating Conditions (MC), which are used to determine an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.  By recognizing that individual\ncircumstances of each case are different, the guidelines provide substantive standards to assist an\nadministrative judge in weighing the evidence in order to reach a fair, impartial and common sense\ndecision.\nThese Guidelines are not inflexible ironclad rules of law.  Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, an administrative judge should apply these Guidelines in\nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. Guideline \u00b6 2.  An administrative\njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision.  Because the\nentire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person\nconcept,\u201d an administrative judge should consider all available, reliable information about the\nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. Guideline \u00b6 2(c).\nSpecifically, an administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors\nlisted at Guideline \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6)\nthe presence or absence of rehabilitation and other behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the\nconduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of\ncontinuation or recurrence.\u201d\n\n\u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a\n5\nconclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the record.\u201d ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4,\n2006)(citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1). \u201cThis is something less than the weight of the evidence, and the possibility of\ndrawing two inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent [a Judge\u2019s] finding from being supported\nby \u201csubstantial evidence.\u201d Consolo v. Federal Maritime Comm\u2019n, 383 U.S. 607, 620 (1966). \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d\nis \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than preponderance.\u201d See v. Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375,\n380 (4  Cir. 1994). \nth\n6\nSince the protection of sensitive information is the paramount consideration, the final\ndecision in each case is arrived at by applying the standard that eligibility for a public trust position\nis \u201cclearly consistent with the interest of national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have drawn\nonly those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the evidence contained in the record.\nLikewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nIn the decision-making process, facts must be established by \u201csubstantial evidence.\u201d  The\n5\nGovernment initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish a case which demonstrates,\nin accordance with the Directive, that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant\nor continue an applicant\u2019s access to classified information.  Once the Government has produced\nsubstantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, the burden shifts to Applicant to produce evidence\nand prove a mitigating condition.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 provides, \u201cThe applicant is responsible for\npresenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by\napplicant or proven by Department Counsel, and [applicant] has the ultimate burden of persuasion\nas to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d The burden of disproving a mitigating condition\nnever shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \u201cAny\ndoubt concerning personnel being considered for access to classified information will be resolved\nin favor of national security.\u201d Guideline \u00b6 2(b).  These same burdens of proof apply to\ntrustworthiness determinations for ADP positions.\nA person who seeks eligibility for a public trust position enters into a fiduciary relationship\nwith the government predicated upon trust and confidence.  It is a relationship that transcends normal\nduty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well.  It is because of this special relationship\nthe government must be able to repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to\nwhom it grants access to classified information.  Decisions under this Directive include, by necessity,\nconsideration of the possible risk an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information.  Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible\nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.\nThe scope of an administrative judge\u2019s decision is limited.  Nothing in this Decision should\nbe construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole or in part, on any express or implied\ndetermination as to Applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or patriotism.  Executive Order 10865, \u00a7 7.\nCONCLUSIONS\nI considered all facts in evidence and legal standards, including the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept,\nand concluded the following with respect to the allegations set forth in the SOR.  \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations\n\n7\nGuideline \u00b6 18 articulates the Government\u2019s concern regarding financial problems.  \u201cFailure\nor inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate\npoor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which\ncan raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified\ninformation.  An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal\nacts to generate funds.\u201d\nTwo Financial Considerations Disqualifying Conditions could raise a trustworthiness concern\nand may be disqualifying in this case: \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts\u201d and \u201ca history of\nnot meeting financial obligations.\u201d Guidelines \u00b6 19(a) and (c).  Applicant admitted that she had\ninsufficient funds to meet her debts for a period of time.  According to credit reports, Applicant has\na history of failing to meet her financial obligations since early 2000.  DOHA\u2019s Appeal Board has\nconcluded that \u201c[a] person who is unwilling to fulfill his legal obligations does not demonstrate the\nhigh degree of good judgment and reliability required of persons granted access to classified\ninformation.\u201d ISCR Case No. 98-0810 at 4 (App. Bd. June 8, 2000). \nAfter the Government produced substantial evidence of these two disqualifying conditions,\nthe burden shifted to Applicant to produce evidence and prove a mitigating condition.  Six Financial\nConsiderations Mitigating Conditions under Guidelines \u00b6 20(a)-(e) are potentially applicable:\n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under\nsuch circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the\nindividual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness or good judgment;\n(b) the conditions that resulted in the behavior were largely beyond the\nperson\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected\nmedical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual acted\nresponsibly under the circumstances;\n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and there\nare clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control;\n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or\notherwise resolve debts; \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-\ndue debt, which is the cause of the problem and provides documented proof to\nsubstantiate the dispute or provides evidence of actions to resolve the issue;\n(f) the affluence resulted from a legal source of income.\nBased on my evaluation of the record evidence as a whole, I conclude Guideline \u00b6 20(a) does\nnot apply as several debts are current.  Some of Applicant\u2019s difficulties are attributable to marital\nproblems and medical issues, which trigger the application of Guideline \u00b6 20(b).  However, there is\ninsufficient evidence in the record to indicate that during those periods of difficulties, she acted\n\u201cresponsibly under the circumstance.\u201d Hence, the mitigation provided under this guideline is limited.\nAlthough Applicant has been in touch with a credit counselor and intends to enter into a debt\nconsolidation plan, she did not produce evidence of that agreement, which would be necessary for\nthe application of Guideline \u00b6 20(c).  She has, however, demonstrated that she resolved seven of the\ndebts and her student loan problems.  She has not incurred additional debts since she began her\npresent job.  Once she resumes work full time, she will have sufficient income to continue repaying\nall of her debts, which she expressed a commitment to do.  Because the law does not require her to\nhave paid-off every debt in full, her effort over the past year to pay some creditors, despite a limited\n\n8\nincome, is sufficient mitigation under Guideline \u00b6 20 (d).  Applicant disputed the debt listed in \u00b6 1.v,\nwhich constitutes mitigation under Guideline \u00b6 20(e) for that debt.  Guideline \u00b6 20(f) does not apply.\nGuideline E: Personal Conduct\nGuideline \u00b6 15 articulates the Government\u2019s concern regarding personal conduct: \u201cConduct\ninvolving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules\nand regulations can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information.  Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful and candid\nanswers during the security clearance process or any other failure to cooperate with the security\nclearance process.\u201d \nOne personal conduct disqualifying condition is particularly relevant and potentially\ndisqualifying in this case.  Guideline \u00b6 16(a) provides that the \u201cdeliberate omission, concealment,\nor falsification of relevant facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history\nstatement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications,\naward benefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award\nfiduciary responsibilities\u201d may raise a trustworthy concern.  Applicant\u2019s e-QIP had incorrect answers\nto questions 19 and 20.  Applicant denied that she intentionally falsified her answers.\nWhen a falsification allegation is controverted or denied, the government has the burden of\nproving it.  Proof of an omission, standing alone, does not establish or prove an applicant\u2019s state of\nmind when the omission occurred.  An administrative judge must consider the record evidence as\na whole to determine whether there is direct or circumstantial evidence concerning an applicant\u2019s\nstate of mind at the time the omission occurred.  See ISCR Case No. 03-09483 at 4 (App. Bd.\nNov.17, 2004) (explaining holding in ISCR Case No. 02-23133 at 5 (App. Bd. Jun. 9, 2004).\nApplicant asserted that she did not disclose a January 2004 judgment because she did not\nhave knowledge of it when she submitted her e-QIP in March 2005.  To corroborate her assertion\nthat she did not intentionally falsify her answers, she produced the January 2005 e-QIP worksheet\nin which she listed a judgment she previously paid as an indication of her efforts to be truthful.  She\nindicated that she was unaware of her debt problems until she met with an investigator in May 2006\nand obtained her credit report in October.  She attributes her lack of knowledge to not having\nreviewed a credit report since 2000 and not receiving mail for a period of time.  Based on her\ndemeanor and presentation, her explanations are reasonable and credible.  I believe her omissions\nwere negligent and not intentional.  Hence, the evidence does not establish deliberate falsification.\nAccordingly, Guideline E is found in her favor.\nWhole Person Analysis\nIn addition to the enumerated disqualifying and mitigating conditions, I have considered the\ngeneral adjudicative guidelines related to the whole person concept under Guideline \u00b6 2(a).\nApplicant has made progress in resolving 11 of the SOR debts, as noted by the evidence she\nproduced.  She appears to be committed to paying the rest of them through a debt consolidation plan\nthat she is in the process of entering.  Her student loans, which constitute the majority of her debt,\nhave been current for the last year.  She managed to pay seven debts despite a limited income and\nhas not incurred additional delinquent debts for a couple years.  She has a good job that will afford\nher the means to continue achieving financial stability.  Although her past marital situations have\n\n9\ncreated some of her current obligations, she takes responsibility for their resolution and appears to\nbe on a track of financial management, sufficient to demonstrate reliability and good judgment.  I\ndo not believe she is a security risk nor do I believe her financial problems will recur, given her\nawareness of the potential problems they could create for her employment situation.\nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, all facts and circumstances, in\nthe context of the whole person, I conclude she has mitigated the security concerns raised pertaining\nto financial considerations.  The evidence leaves me with no doubts as to Applicant\u2019s trustworthiness\neligibility and suitability.  Accordingly, Guideline F is decided in her favor.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal Findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required\nby Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are as follows:\nParagraph 1: Guideline F (Financial Considerations)\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a\u20131.v: \nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2: Guideline E (Personal Conduct)\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 2.a - 2.c:\nFor Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances and evidence presented in this case, it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a public trust position.\nEligibility for an ADP I/II/III position is granted.\nShari Dam\nAdministrative Judge\n",

The\n1\nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a security clearance\nfor Applicant.  As required by Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within\nIndustry, dated February 20, 1960, as amended, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6,\nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive), dated January 2,\n1992, as amended, DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) on March 14, 2007, detailing the\nbasis for its decision \u2013 security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of the\nDirective.  The President issued revised adjudicative guidelines (Guidelines) on December 30, 2005.\nDoD implemented them on September 1, 2006.  Pending official amendment/reissue of DoD\nDirective 5220.6, the Guidelines are to be used in all cases when the SOR is dated on or after\nSeptember 1, 2006.  Because the SOR was issued after September 1, 2006, DoD policy requires that\nthis case proceed under the revised guidelines. \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on April 5, 2007, and requested a decision without\na hearing.  Department Counsel submitted a file of relevant material (FORM) in support of the\ngovernment\u2019s case, a copy of which was received by Applicant on May 4, 2007.  Applicant was\nafforded the opportunity to file objections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, or\nmitigation by June 3, 2007.  He filed no response.  The case was assigned to me on July 19, 2007.\n  \nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant admitted the allegations contained in the SOR.  The admissions are incorporated\nherein as findings of fact.  After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and\nupon due consideration of same, I make the following additional findings of fact: \nApplicant is a 43-year-old network administrator employed by a federal government\ncontractor.

He indicated he received several responses from creditors, and\nthat he needed additional information from other creditors.   In his Answer, he stated he had started\n6\nmaking payments on one account, and that he intended to pay his delinquent bills, but he was unable\nto  to do so because he could not send payments until he was sure payments would be posted to the\nproper accounts.   As of November 30, 2006, none of these debts were paid.   His monthly budget\n7\n8\nattached to his interrogatory answers showed a surplus of $473 per month, after all expenses.  \n9\nPOLICIES\nIn an evaluation of an applicant\u2019s security suitability, an administrative judge must consider\nthe \u201cAdjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility For Access to Classified Information\u201d\n(Guidelines).

Because the\nentire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person\nconcept,\u201d an administrative judge should consider all available, reliable information about the\nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.10\nSpecifically, an administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors\nlisted at Guidelines \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency\nand recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5)\nextent to which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d\nSince the protection of the national security is the paramount consideration, the final decision\nin each case is arrived at by applying the standard that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being\n\nGuidelines \u00b6 2(b).\n11\n\u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might  accept as adequate to support a\n12\nconclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the record.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006)\n(citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1).  \u201cThis is something less than the weight of the evidence, and the possibility of drawing\ntwo inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent [a Judge\u2019s] finding from being supported by substantial\nevidence.\u201d  Consolo v. Federal Maritime Comm\u2019n, 383 U.S. 607, 620 (1966).  \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a\nscintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4  Cir. 1994).\nth\nSee ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  The Administrative Judge [considers] the record evidence\n13\n \nas a whole, both favorable and unfavorable, evaluate[s] Applicant\u2019s past and current circumstances in light of pertinent\nprovisions of the Directive, and decide[s] whether Applicant ha[s] met his burden of persuasion under Directive \u00b6\nE3.1.15.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 04-10340 at 2 (App. Bd. July 6, 2006). \nExecutive Order 10865, \u00a7 7. \n14\n5\nconsidered for access to classified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d   In\n11\nreaching this decision, I have drawn conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the record\nevidence , and have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nIn the decision-making process, facts must be established by \u201csubstantial evidence.\u201d   The\n12\nGovernment initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish a case which demonstrates,\nin accordance with the Directive, that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant\nor continue an applicant\u2019s access to classified information.  Once the government has produced\nsubstantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, the burden shifts to Applicant to produce evidence\nand prove a mitigating condition.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 provides, \u201cThe applicant is responsible for\npresenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by\napplicant or proven by Department Counsel, and [applicant] has the ultimate burden of persuasion\nas to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  The burden of disproving a mitigating condition\nnever shifts to the government.13\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with\nthe government predicated upon trust and confidence.  It is a relationship that transcends normal duty\nhours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well.  It is because of this special relationship the\ngovernment must be able to repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to\nwhom it grants access to classified information.  Decisions under this Directive and the guidelines\ninclude, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or\ninadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain\ndegree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.  The scope of an administrative judge\u2019s decision is limited.  Nothing in this\ndecision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole or in part, on any\nexpress or implied determination as to Applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or patriotism.  \n14\nCONCLUSIONS\nGuidelines \u00b618.  The Concern. Failure or inability to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by\nrules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual's reliability,\n\n6\ntrustworthiness and ability to protect classified information.  An individual who is financially\noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.  Compulsive gambling\nis a concern as it may lead to financial crimes including espionage.  Affluence that cannot be\nexplained by known sources of income is also a security concern.  It may indicate proceeds from\nfinancially profitable criminal acts\nGuidelines \u00b619.  Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include:\n(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and\n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.\nGuidelines \u00b6 20.  Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include:\n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such\ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's current\nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;\n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person's\ncontrol (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death,\ndivorce or separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;\n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear\nindications that the problem is being resolved or is under control;\n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve\ndebts;\n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-due debt which\nis the cause of the problem and provides documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute\nor provides evidence of actions to resolve the issue; and \n(f) the affluence resulted from a legal source of income.\nThe government established its case under Guideline F.  Financial Considerations\nDisqualifying Conditions (FC DC) Guidelines \u00b619 (a) (Inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts)\nand FC DC Guidelines \u00b619 (c) (A history of not meeting financial obligations) are applicable.  The\navailable information demonstrates Applicant has a history of not meeting his financial obligations\nfrom 2003 to the present.  He has been delinquent in payments on numerous accounts, had multiple\naccounts charged off or placed for collection.  He provided no evidence that anything more than one\npayment had been made.  The disqualifying conditions are applicable.\nVarious conditions can mitigate the security concerns arising from financial difficulties.\nApplicant provided no evidence as to the cause or causes of his delinquent debts, nor a reason why\nhe has made no effort to resolve indebtedness.  There is no evidence of Applicant establishing a plan\nfor repayment.  He was given an opportunity to provide documentation of efforts to resolve his\nfinancial difficulties.  He chose not to respond.  Absent sufficient evidence to prove a mitigating\n\nDirective \u00b6 E.2.2.1.\n15\nId.\n16\nId.\n17\n7\ncondition, I find none of the mitigating conditions are applicable, and I conclude Guideline F against\nApplicant.\nWhole Person Analysis\n\u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make\nan affirmative determination that the person is eligible for a security clearance.\u201d   \u201cAvailable,\n15\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be\nconsidered in reaching a determination.\u201d   In addition to the disqualifying and mitigating conditions,\n16\nI also considered the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept in evaluating Applicant\u2019s risk and vulnerability in\nprotecting our national interests.   I considered his age (43), his employment, and what might cause\n17\nhim to be in continual financial distress.  He has had a  history of financial delinquencies, including\ncharge-offs and collections,  and he failed to present any evidence showing why he incurred\ndelinquent debts between 2030 and 2005 that remain unpaid.  The record contains insufficient\nevidence to make a determination of why he is indebted and to find any mitigating condition\napplicable.  The underlying reasons for his delinquent obligations can only be conjecture.  Therefore,\nthe totality of the record leads me to conclude that Applicant does not have the ability nor the\nreliability to protect classified information, and cannot exercise the requisite good judgment and\ndiscretion expected of one in whom the government entrusts its interests.  I conclude it is not clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s security clearance.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required\nby E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1.

FOREMAN\nAPPEARANCES\nFOR GOVERNMENT\nDaniel F. Crowley, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nSYNOPSIS\nApplicant used marijuana about 50 times between February 2000 and March 2005, purchased\nmarijuana about 10 times during that period, and used opium twice in December 2002.  He last used\n\n2\nmarijuana while he was employed by a defense contractor and awaiting a decision on his security\nclearance application.  The security concerns raised by his drug involvement are not mitigated.\nClearance is denied.\n\n3\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn December 26, 2006, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its preliminary decision to deny Applicant a\nsecurity clearance.  This action was taken Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified\nInformation within Industry (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified; Department of Defense\nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Jan. 2, 1992),\nas amended and modified (Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines approved by the\nPresident on December 29, 2005, and implemented effective September 1, 2006 (Guidelines).  The\nSOR alleged security concerns raised under Guideline H (Drug Involvement). Applicant answered\nthe SOR in writing on February 12, 2007, and elected to have the case decided on the written record\nin lieu of a hearing. Department Counsel submitted the Government\u2019s written case on March 27,\n2007. A complete copy of the file of relevant material (FORM) was provided to Applicant, who was\nafforded an opportunity to file objections and submit material to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the\ndisqualifying conditions. Applicant received the FORM on April 5, 2007 and responded on May 16,\n2007.  Applicant\u2019s response to the FORM was dated and mailed more than 30 days after his receipt\nof the FORM, but Department Counsel did not object to the untimely response.  Accordingly, I have\nconsidered Applicant\u2019s response in making my decision.  The case was assigned to me on May 29,\n2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant's admissions in his answer to the SOR and response to the FORM are incorporated\ninto my findings of fact.  I make the following findings:\nApplicant is a 25-year-old software engineer for a defense contractor.  He received a bachelor\nof science degree in computer engineering in May 2005 and began working for his current employer\nimmediately thereafter.  He has never held a security clearance.\nApplicant executed a security clearance application in July 2005, in which he disclosed using\nmarijuana about 50 times between February 2000 and March 2005, and using opium twice in\nDecember 2002.  In his answer to the SOR, he admitted this conduct (alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.d).\nHe also admitted purchasing marijuana at least ten times (alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.c), and using marijuana\nonce during a college reunion in September 2005 (alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b).\nIn his response to the FORM, Applicant declared his willingness to undergo \u201ccontinual and\nregular drug screenings\u201d and \u201cto enroll in a drug counseling program as deemed necessary by the\nGovernment of the United States.\u201d  There is no evidence he has submitted to drug screening or\nsought drug counseling.\nPOLICIES\n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d  Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S.\n518, 528 (1988).  As Commander in Chief, the President has \u201cthe authority to . . . control access to\ninformation bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently\n\n4\ntrustworthy to occupy a position . . . that will give that person access to such information.\u201d  Id. at\n527.  The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants\neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with\nthe national interest to do so.\u201d  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within\nIndustry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.  \u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination\nof a sufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the person is an\nacceptable security risk.\u201d  Guidelines \u00b6 2(a)  Each clearance decision must be a fair, impartial, and\ncommonsense decision based on the relevant and material facts and circumstances, the whole person\nconcept, the disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions under each specific guideline, and\nthe factors listed in the Guidelines \u00b6\u00b6 2(a)(1)-(9).\nA person granted access to classified information enters into a special relationship with the\ngovernment.  The government must be able to have a high degree of trust and confidence in persons\nwith access to classified information.  However, the decision to deny an individual a security\nclearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  See Exec. Or. 10865\n\u00a7 7.  It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the\nSecretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.\nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the personal\nor professional history of the applicant which disqualify, or may disqualify, the applicant from being\neligible for access to classified information.  See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is\n\u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth.,\n36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994).  The Guidelines presume a nexus or rational connection between\nproven conduct under any of the criteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability.  See\nISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).  \nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial evidence, the\nburden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts.  See Directive \u00b6\nE3.1.15.  An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with\nthe national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App.\nBd. Dec. 19, 2002).  \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of\ndenials.\u201d  Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see Guidelines \u00b6 2(b). \nCONCLUSIONS\nGuideline H (Drug Involvement)\nThe concern under this guideline is as follows: \u201cUse of an illegal drug or misuse of a\nprescription drug can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both\nbecause it may impair judgment and because it raises questions about a person\u2019s ability or\nwillingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations.\u201d Guidelines \u00b6 24. This guideline\nencompasses involvement with \u201c[d]rugs, materials, and other chemical compounds identified and\nlisted in the Controlled Substances Act of 1970, as amended (e.g., marijuana or cannabis,\ndepressants, narcotics, stimulants, and hallucinogens).\u201d  Guidelines \u00b6 24(a)(1).  Drug abuse is \u201cthe\nillegal use of a drug or use of a legal drug in a manner that deviates from approved medical\ndirection.\u201d  Guidelines \u00b6 24(b).\n\n5\nDisqualifying conditions under this guideline include \u201cany drug abuse,\u201d and \u201cillegal drug\npossession, including cultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or\npossession of drug paraphernalia.\u201d  Guidelines \u00b6 25(a) and (c).  The evidence in this case establishes\nthese two disqualifying conditions.\nSince the government produced substantial evidence to raise \u00b6\u00b6 25(a) and (c), the burden\nshifted to Applicant to produce evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts.  Directive\n\u00b6 E3.1.15.  An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, and the burden of\ndisproving it is never shifted to the government.  See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep.\n22, 2005).  \nSecurity concerns raised by drug involvement may be mitigated by showing that \u201cthe\nbehavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened under such circumstances that it is\nunlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or\ngood judgment.\u201d  Guidelines \u00b6 26(a).  The first clause of \u00b6 26(a) (\u201chappened so long ago\u201d) focuses\non the recency of drug involvement.  There are no \u201cbright line\u201d rules for determining when conduct\nis \u201crecent.\u201d  The determination must be based on a careful evaluation of the totality of the evidence.\nISCR Case No. 02-24452 at 6 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2004).  If the evidence shows \u201ca significant period\nof time has passed without any evidence of misconduct,\u201d then an administrative judge must\ndetermine whether that period of time demonstrates \u201cchanged circumstances or conduct sufficient\nto warrant a finding of reform or rehabilitation.\u201d  Id.  \nApplicant\u2019s drug involvement occurred during his college years and continued during his\ncurrent employment.  When he executed his SF 86 in July 2005, he was on notice that drug\ninvolvement raised security concerns.  Nevertheless, he succumbed to peer pressure during his\ncollege reunion in September 2005 and again used marijuana.  While he apparently has not used\ndrugs since September 2005, he has been living under a microscope since he received the SOR in\nDecember 2006.  His abstinence from drugs for about 20 months is \u201ca significant period,\u201d but it must\nbe considered in the context of a five-year pattern of frequent and regular drug use that continued\nafter he applied for a security clearance.  I am not convinced Applicant has left behind his casual\nattitude about drug use.  His drug use while his application was pending raises serious doubts about\nhis judgment and his willingness to follow rules.  I conclude Applicant has not carried his burden\nof establishing the mitigating condition in Guidelines \u00b6 26(a).\nSecurity concerns arising from drug involvement also may be mitigated by evidence of \u201ca\ndemonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future, such as: (1) disassociation from drug-using\nassociates and contacts; (2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; [or] (3)\nan appropriate period of abstinence.\u201d  Guidelines \u00b6 26(b)(1)-(3).  Applicant has declared his intent\nto abstain from drugs, but he has not demonstrated that intent.  He readily succumbed to peer\npressure in September 2005.  He has produced no evidence of a lifestyle change, disassociation from\ndrug users, counseling, or other support systems to reinforce abstinence from drugs.  He has declared\nhis willingness to under drug screening and enroll in a drug counseling program, but he has not\nundergone screening or sought counseling.  His period of abstinence, standing alone, is insufficient\nto establish this mitigating condition, especially when considered in the context of his five-year\nhistory of frequent and regular drug use.\nThe Whole Person\n\n6\nIn addition to considering the specific disqualifying and mitigating conditions under\nGuideline H, I have also considered: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency\nand recency of the conduct; (4) the applicant\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the\nextent to which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  Guidelines\n\u00b6\u00b6 2(a)(1)-(9).  Several of these factors are incorporated in the discussion of Guideline H, but some\nmerit additional comment.\nApplicant\u2019s illegal drug abuse was serious misconduct, in which he participated willingly and\nfrequently.  When he last used marijuana, he was a 23-year-old college graduate employed by a\ndefense contractor and awaiting a decision on his application for a security clearance.  The likelihood\nof recurrence once he is relieved from the pressure of qualifying for a clearance cannot be\ndetermined on the basis of this record.\nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline H, and evaluating\nall the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the\nsecurity concerns based on his drug involvement.  Accordingly, I conclude he has not carried his\nburden of showing that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him a security\nclearance.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nThe following are my conclusions as to each allegation in the SOR:\nParagraph 1.  Guideline H:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a- 1.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all of the circumstances in this case, it is not clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant Applicant a security clearance.

On January 4, 2007, DOHA issued a statement of reasons advising Applicant of the basis\nfor that decision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline H (Drug Involvement), Guideline E\n\n2\n(Personal Conduct), and Guideline J (Criminal Conduct) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6\n(Jan. 2, 1992), as amended (Directive).  Applicant requested the case be decided on the written\nrecord.  On May 24, 2007, after considering the record, Administrative Judge Joan Caton Anthony\ndenied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant timely appealed pursuant to the\nDirective \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raises the following issue on appeal: whether the Administrative Judge\u2019s decision\nis arbitrary, capricious, and contrary to law.  \nIn this case, Applicant had a history of cocaine use, including while he held a security\nclearance.  He purchased cocaine and on two occasions pled guilty to cocaine possession, a felony.\nFollowing another arrest, for possession of a controlled substance, Applicant was not prosecuted.\nApplicant was arrested four times for driving while intoxicated or driving under the influence and,\non one of those occasions, for driving with a suspended license.  Applicant provided only some of\nthe above information when he filled out security clearance applications in 1992 and 2005.   \n \nApplicant admitted most of the allegations, and those admissions were sufficient to establish\nthe government\u2019s case against him.  The burden of proof then shifted to Applicant to rebut, explain,\nextenuate, or mitigate the case against him.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  With regard to the falsification\nallegations, Applicant explained that his omissions were due either to inadvertence or to his\nmisunderstanding of the questions.  In mitigation of the Guideline H concerns, Applicant stated that\nhe had completely stopped using cocaine and had changed his lifestyle for the better due to his\nreligious involvement.  He also pointed out that he has held a security clearance for 31 years,  been\na dutiful employee, and never compromised national security.  Applicant did not submit any\ndocumentary exhibits or witness statements. \nWith regard to Applicant\u2019s work record, the federal government need not wait until an\napplicant actually mishandles classified material before it can deny or revoke access to such material.\nSee Adams v. Laird, 420 F. 2d 230, 238-239 (D.C. Cir. 1969), cert. denied, 397 U.S. 1039 (1970).\nAn applicant with good or exemplary job performance may engage in conduct that has negative\nsecurity implications.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-11172 at 2 (App. Bd. Sep. 4, 2007).  In this case,\nApplicant admitted using cocaine while he held a security clearance. \n  \nApplicant objects to the Judge\u2019s statement, under each of the Guidelines, that there was no\ncredible evidence to support Applicant\u2019s statement as it related to each of the Guidelines.\nApplicant\u2019s statement regarding his present drug-free lifestyle and his explanation of his failure to\nprovide certain information on his security clearance applications were relevant and material\nevidence.  However, Applicant\u2019s statement were not binding and conclusive on the Judge.  Rather,\nthe Judge had to consider Applicant\u2019s statement  in light of the record evidence as a whole.  See, e.g.,\nISCR Case No. 99-0005 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 19, 2000).  In this case, Applicant elected to have his\ncase decided upon the written record\u2014a circumstance which deprived the Judge of an opportunity\nto question Applicant about her concerns and evaluate his credibility in the context of a hearing.  In\nresponse to the government\u2019s File of Relevant Material (FORM), Applicant did not submit any\ndocumentary evidence or witness statements, other than his own statement.  The Judge did not find\nApplicant\u2019s statement credible.  Applicant has not met his burden of demonstrating that the Judge\nerred in concluding that the government\u2019s security concerns had not been mitigated.   \n\n3\nEven if she had found some evidence of mitigation, that alone would not compel the Judge\nto make a favorable security clearance decision.  As the trier of fact, the Judge has to weigh the\nevidence as a whole and decide whether the favorable evidence outweighs the unfavorable, or vice\nversa.  An applicant\u2019s disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, or an ability to argue\nfor a different interpretation of the evidence, is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed the\nevidence or reached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.\nOrder\nThe Judge\u2019s adverse security clearance decision is AFFIRMED.\n          \nSigned: Jeffrey D.

On January 4, 2007, under the applicable Executive Order  and Department\n1\nof Defense Directive,  DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its\n2\ndecision\u2013security concerns raised under Adjudicative Guidelines H (Drug Involvement), J (Criminal\nConduct), and E (Personal Conduct), promulgated December 29, 2005, and applicable in DoD\nadjudications of SORs issued as of September 1, 2006, and thereafter.  With the SOR, DOHA provided\nApplicant with a copy of the Directive and the applicable Adjudicative Guidelines.  On February 9,\n2007, Applicant executed a notarized answer to the SOR.  He requested his case be determined on the\nrecord in lieu of a hearing.  The Government compiled its File of Relevant Material (FORM) on March\n7, 2007.  The FORM contained documents identified as Items 1 through 6.  \nOn March 13, 2007,  Applicant was provided a copy of the FORM, with instructions to submit\nany additional information and/or objections within 30 days of receipt.  He submitted additional\ninformation within the 30-day time period, and Department Counsel did not object to the admission\nof Applicant\u2019s submission.  On April 16, 2007, the case was assigned to me for a decision.  After a\ncareful review of Applicant\u2019s submission in response to the FORM, I admitted it to the record as\nApplicant\u2019s Exhibit (Ex.) A.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant is 50 years old, never married, and employed as a nuclear pumper by a defense\ncontractor.  He is the father of an adult daughter. He has worked for his present employer since 1975,\nand he has held a security clearance since 1976. (Item 4; Item 5.)\nThe SOR (Item 1) alleges under Guideline H, Drug Involvement, that Applicant used cocaine,\nwith varying frequency, from about 1989  to about November 1997 and from 2004 to at least June\n3\n2005 (SOR\u00b6 1.a.) and that he purchased cocaine (SOR  \u00b6 1.b.).  The SOR also alleges Applicant was\narrested in about November 1996 and charged with Possession of Drugs, a felony. (See Item 6.)\nApplicant pled guilty to Possession of Cocaine, was sentenced to two years probation, and ordered to\nattend drug counseling. (SOR \u00b6 1.c.)\n\n3\nThe SOR further alleges Applicant was arrested again in about March 1998 and charged with\nPossession of Drugs, a felony. (See Item 6.)  At that time, Applicant pled guilty to Possession of\nCocaine, was sentenced to two years probation, and was ordered to attend drug counseling  (SOR \u00b6\n1.d.).\nThe SOR alleges, and Item 6 corroborates, that in October 1998, Applicant was arrested and\ncharged with Possession of Controlled Substance, a felony.  The charge was Nolle Pressed. (SOR \u00b6\n1.e.)  The SOR alleges under Guideline H that Applicant used cocaine while holding a security\nclearance in 1976.  (SOR \u00b6 1.f.)  Applicant admitted all Guideline H allegations.  His admissions are\nincorporated herein as findings of fact.\nIn February 1992, Applicant completed a Department of Defense National Agency\nQuestionnaire (NAQ).  (Item 5)  Question 20 on the NAQ reads as follows: \u201c20. Drug/Alcohol Use\nand Mental Health  Have you ever tried or used or possessed any narcotic (to include heroin or\ncocaine), depressant (to include quaaludes), stimulant, hallucinogen (to include LSD or PCP), or\ncannabis (to include marijuana or hashish), or any mind-altering substance (to include glue or paint),\neven one-time or on an experimental basis, except as prescribed by a licensed physician?\u201d Applicant\nresponded \u201cno\u201d to Question 20.  On February 11, 1992, he signed and dated the following certification\nupon completion of the NAQ: \u201cI certify that the entries made by me are true, complete, and accurate\nto the best of my knowledge and belief and are made in good faith.  I understand that a knowing and\nwillful false statement on this form can be punished by fine or imprisonment or both.  (See U.S. Code,\nTitle 18, Section 1001).\u201d  DOHA alleged Applicant falsified material facts by deliberately failing to\nlist his cocaine use from 1989 to at least 1992, as set forth in SOR allegation 1.a. (SOR \u00b6 2.a.)\nIn September 2005, Applicant executed an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations\nProcessing (e-QIP).  (Item  4.)  Section 24 on the e-QIP reads as follows: \u201cSection 24: Your Use of\nIllegal Drugs and Drug Activity  The following questions pertain to the illegal use of drugs or drug\nactivity.  You are required to answer the questions fully and truthfully, and your failure to do so could\nbe grounds for an adverse employment decision or action against you, but neither your truthful\nresponses nor information derived from your responses will be used as evidence against you in any\nsubsequent criminal proceeding.  a. Since the age of 16 or in the last 7 years, whichever is shorter,\nhave you illegally used any controlled substance, for example, marijuana, cocaine, crack cocaine,\nhashish, narcotics (opium, morphine, codeine, heroin, etc.), amphetamines, depressants (barbiturates,\nmethacholine, tranquilizers, etc.), hallucinogenic (LSD, PCP, etc.) or prescription drugs?\u201dApplicant\nanswered \u201cyes\u201d and stated he used cocaine about six times from March 1997 to October 1998.  After\ncompleting the questionnaire, Applicant signed and certified the following statement: \nMy statements on this form, and any attachments to it, are true,\ncomplete, and correct to the best of my knowledge and belief and are\nmade in good faith. I understand that a knowing and willful false\nstatement on this form can be punished by fine or imprisonment or\nboth. (See Section 1001 of title 18, United States Code.)\nDOHA alleged Applicant materially falsified material facts in his answer by deliberately failing to fully\ndisclose his use of cocaine to at least June 2005.  (SOR \u00b6 2.b.)\nIn the SOR, DOHA also alleged under Guideline E that Applicant used cocaine while holding\na security clearance granted in 1976.  (SOR \u00b6 2.c.)  Applicant admitted all Guideline E allegations,\n\n4\nwhich are admitted herein as findings of fact.  In mitigation, Applicant stated he had no intention to\nfalsify his answers to Question 20 and Section 24.  He also stated he had changed his life drastically\nand had become a religious person.  (Item 3 at 2.)  He also claimed he did not clearly understand the\nquestions and should have proofread his answers thoroughly before submitting them.  (Item 3 at 2.)\nIn his response to the FORM, Applicant admitted he did not include his 2004 cocaine use in\nhis answer to Section 24 on the e-QIP because he was not convicted of the use and mistakenly thought\nSection 24 required him to list only convictions for illegal drug use.  He pointed out he had answered\n\u201cyes\u201d to Section 24 and offered his affirmative answer as proof of his intent not to deceive the\ngovernment.  (Response to FORM at 1-2.)\nAlso in his response to the FORM, Applicant stated he answered \u201cno\u201d to Question 20 by\nmistake and did not intend to deliberately falsify material facts on his 1992 NAQ.  (Response to\nFORM at 1-2.)  Applicant further asserted he had not used cocaine since 2005, had possessed a\nsecurity clearance since 1976, and his recent conduct presented no threat to national security.\n(Response to FORM at 2-3.)\nIn the SOR, DOHA alleged under Guideline J, Criminal Conduct, that the information alleged\nin subparagraphs 2.a. and 2.b. under Guideline E above constituted a violation of Federal law, pursuant\nto section 1001 of Title 18, U.S.C. and was a felony crime.  (SOR \u00b6 3.a.)  DOHA also alleged that the\ninformation set forth in SOR allegations 1.c., 1.d., and 1.e. under Guideline H also constituted criminal\nconduct. (SOR \u00b6 3.b.)\nDOHA also asserted in the SOR that criminal conduct security concerns were raised by the\nfollowing: that Applicant was arrested in about 1977 and charged with Driving Under the Influence\n(DUI) (SOR \u00b6 3.c.); that he was arrested in 1978 and charged with DUI (SOR \u00b6 3.d.); that he was\narrested in November 1987, charged with Driving While Intoxicated (DWI), found guilty, referred by\nthe court to a substance abuse program, and his driver\u2019s license was suspended for six months (SOR\n\u00b6 3.e.); that he was arrested in March 1998, charged with (1) DWI and (2) Driving Under Revocation\nor suspension, that he was found guilty on both counts, and his driver\u2019s license was suspended for one\nyear for Count (1) and 90 days for Count (2) (SOR \u00b6 3.f.).  Applicant admitted all Guideline J\nallegations and asserted he had \u201cattended all classes and followed the rules and guidelines set forth in\nall programs that were issued to [him] and completed them accordingly.\u201d (Item 3 at 2.)  He provided\nno credible evidence to corroborate his assertion.  Applicant\u2019s admissions are admitted herein as\nfindings of fact.\nPOLICIES\n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d  Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518,\n528 (1988).  As Commander in Chief, the President has \u201cthe authority to . . . control access to\ninformation bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently\ntrustworthy to occupy a position . . . that will give that person access to such information.\u201d  Id. at 527.\nThe President has restricted eligibility for access to classified information to United States citizens\n\u201cwhose personal and professional history affirmatively indicates loyalty to the United States, strength\nof character, trustworthiness, honesty, reliability, discretion, and sound judgment, as well as freedom\nfrom conflicting allegiances and potential for coercion, and willingness and ability to abide by\nregulations governing the use, handling, and protection of classified information.\u201d  Exec. Or. 12968,\n\n5\nAccess to Classified Information \u00a7 3.1(b) (Aug. 2, 1995).  Eligibility for a security clearance is\npredicated upon the applicant meeting the security guidelines contained in the Directive.\nBy Memorandum dated August 30, 2006, the Under Secretary of Defense directed\nimplementation of revised Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified\nInformation, promulgated December 29, 2005, and effective September 1, 2006, as modified. The\nrevised Adjudicative Guidelines replaced the guidelines published in Enclosure 2 to DoD Directive\n5220.6 and Appendix 8 to DoD 5200.2-R, and they apply to all adjudications and other determinations\nin which a SOR had not been issued by September 1, 2006.  Accordingly, since the SOR in this case\nwas issued January 4, 2007, the revised Adjudicative Guidelines apply.\nThe revised Adjudicative Guidelines set forth personal security guidelines, as well as the\ndisqualifying conditions  and mitigating conditions under each guideline.  In evaluating the security\nworthiness of an applicant, the administrative judge must also assess the adjudicative process factors\nlisted in \u00b6 6.3 of the Directive.  The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not\nnecessarily a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7.  It is merely\nan indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of\nDefense have established for issuing a security clearance.\nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the personal\nor professional history of the applicant that disqualify, or may disqualify, the applicant from being\neligible for access to classified information.  See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  The Directive presumes a\nnexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the disqualifying conditions listed\nin the guidelines and an applicant\u2019s security suitability.  See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 (App. Bd.\nMay 2, 1996).  \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial evidence, the burden\nshifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts.  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at\n3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002); see Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of\ndemonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security\nclearance.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3.\nCONCLUSIONS\nGuideline H - Drug Involvement\nAn individual\u2019s use of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug raises questions of\nreliability and trustworthiness because drug use or misuse can impair judgment and raise questions\nabout the person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations.  Guideline H, \u00b6\n24.  Guideline H defines drugs as mood and behavior altering substances. . . . Drugs include: (1)\nDrugs, materials, and other chemical compounds identified and listed in the Controlled Substances\nAct of 1970, as amended (e.g., marijuana or cannabis, depressants, narcotics, stimulants, and\nhallucinogens), and (2) inhalants and other similar substances.  Guideline H, \u00b6 24(a)(1) and \u00b6\n24(a)(2).  The Guideline further defines drug abuse as the illegal use of drug or use of a legal drug in\nan manner that deviates from approved medical direction.  Guideline H, \u00b6 24(b).\n\n DC 25(a) reads: \u201cany drug abuse [as defined in \u00b6 24(b)].\u201d  DC 25(c) reads: \u201cillegal drug possession, including\n4\ncultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution, or possession of drug paraphernalia.\u201d  DC 25(g)\nreads: \u201cany illegal use after being granted a security clearance.\u201d\nSpecific examples of demonstrated intent that might apply under MC26(b) are as follows: (1) disassociation\n5\nfrom drug-using associates and contacts; (2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; (3) an\nappropriate period of abstinence; and (4) A signed statement of intent with automatic revocation of clearance for any\nviolation. \n6\nApplicant\u2019s admitted using cocaine, an illegal drug, with varying frequency, from about 1989\nto about November 1997, and from 2004 until at least June 2005.  He admitted purchasing cocaine,\nand he admitted using cocaine while holding a security clearance granted in 1976.  This conduct raises\nsecurity concerns under Disqualifying Conditions (DC)  25(a), 25(c), and 25(g) of Guideline H.  \n4\nSeveral Mitigating Conditions (MC) under Guideline H might be applicable to Applicant\u2019s\ncase.  If the drug abuse behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened under such\ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability,\ntrustworthiness, or good judgment, then MC 26(a) might apply.  If Applicant intended not to abuse\ndrugs in the future and demonstrated that intent in one of the four ways specified in the Guideline,\nthen MC 26 (b) might apply.   Additionally, drug abuse that is of security concern can be mitigated\n5\nunder MC 26(d) by satisfactory completion of a prescribed drug treatment program, including but not\nlimited to rehabilitation and aftercare requirements, without recurrence of abuse, and a favorable\nprognosis by a duly qualified medical professional.\nThe record shows that Applicant\u2019s cocaine abuse began in about 1989 and continued through\n1997.  Between 2004 and at least June 2005, he abused cocaine again.  Thus, his drug abuse is recent,\nand Applicant provided no credible evidence to corroborate his assertion that he no longer uses drugs\nand has no intent to use them in the future.  During his nearly ten years of cocaine use, Applicant held\na security clearance granted him in 1976. While he stated he had completed drug rehabilitation, he\nprovided no credible evidence that he had actually done so. Moreover, Applicant provided no credible\nevidence to demonstrate his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. Accordingly, I\nconclude that none of the Guideline H MCs apply to the facts of Applicant\u2019s case. \nGuideline E - Personal Conduct\nPersonal Conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability,\ntrustworthiness and ability to protect classified information.  Of special interest is any failure to\nprovide truthful and candid answers during the security clearance process or any other failure to\ncooperate with the security clearance process. Guideline E, \u00b6 15.   \nUnder Guideline E, a security concern is raised by an individual\u2019s deliberate omission,\nconcealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal\nhistory statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment\nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness,\nor award fiduciary responsibilities. Guideline E, \u00b6 16(a). \nApplicant completed a Department of Defense NAQ in February 1992.  Applicant\u2019s signed\nand dated NAQ is entered in the record as Item 5.  In his responses to Question 20,  Applicant denied\n\nDC 31(a) reads: \u201ca single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses.\u201d \n6\n7\nillegal use of drugs and purchase of illegal drugs, conduct which he later admitted occurred from at\nleast 1989 through 1997.  In September 2005, Applicant completed an e-QIP as a part of his security\nclearance investigation.  Applicant\u2019s completed, signed, and certified e-QIP is entered in the record\nas Item 4.  In response to Section 24, Applicant listed cocaine use about six times in 1997 and 1998\nbut failed to list his use of cocaine to at least June 2005.  Through Applicant\u2019s admissions and the\nrecord evidence, the Government established a prima facie case that Applicant falsified his answers\nto Question 20 and Section 24.  The burden of proof thus shifted to Applicant to rebut or mitigate the\nGovernment\u2019s allegations.  Applicant denied he falsified his answers to the questions, but he provided\nno credible evidence in support of his denials.  \nTwo Guideline E mitigating conditions (MC) might be applicable to Applicant\u2019s conduct.\nPursuant to MC 17(a),  personal conduct security concerns might be mitigated if the individual made\nprompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, concealment, or falsification before being\nconfronted with the facts.  Pursuant to MC 17(e), personal conduct security concerns might be\nmitigated if the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability to exploitation,\nmanipulation, or duress.\nApplicant provided no credible evidence to mitigate his failure to list his illegal drug use on\nhis 1992 and 2005 security clearance questionnaires.  At the time he completed his NAQ in 1992,\nApplicant was approximately 25 years old and a mature adult.  In 2005, when he completed his e-QIP,\nhe was 48 years old and had held a security clearance since 1976.  Although he knew, or should have\nknown, the importance of telling the truth to the Government, he had reason to attempt to minimize\nhis knowledge of his drug use.  His assertions that his falsifications were inadvertent were not credible.\nHe did not make good-faith efforts to correct his omissions, concealment, or falsifications before being\nconfronted with the facts, and he did not take positive steps to reduce or eliminate the vulnerability to\nexploitation, manipulation, or duress caused by his on-going use of illegal drugs.  I conclude that MC\n17(a) and MC 17(e) do not apply to the facts of Applicant\u2019s case.\nGuideline J - Criminal Conduct\nThe record in this case shows that Applicant was arrested in once in 1996 and once in 1998\nand charged with cocaine possession.  Also in 1998, he was arrested and charged with possession of\na controlled substance.  In addition, he was arrested and charged with DUI in 1977 and 1978.  In 1987,\nhe was arrested for DWI, found guilty, referred to a substance abuse program, and his driver\u2019s license\nwas suspended for six months.  In 1998, Applicant was again arrested and charged with (1) DWI and\n(2) Driving Under Revocation or suspension.  He was found guilty on both counts, and his driver\u2019s\nlicense was suspended for one year for Count (1) and for 90 days for Count (2)  Additionally,\nApplicant falsified his drug activity on two security clearance applications and failed to rebut the\nGovernment\u2019s prima facie case that his falsifications were deliberate and therefore criminal conduct\nunder 18 U.S.C. section 1001.\nCriminal conduct creates a security concern because it raises doubts about an individual\u2019s\njudgment, reliability, and trustworthiness.  Additionally, it raises doubts about a person\u2019s ability or\nwillingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations.  Applicant\u2019s admitted criminal activity raises\nsecurity concerns under Disqualifying Condition (DC) 31(a)  of Guideline J.\n6\n\n8\nTwo mitigating conditions under Guideline J might apply to the facts of Applicant\u2019s case.\nApplicant\u2019s admitted criminal conduct might be mitigated under Mitigating Condition (MC) 32(a) if\nhe provided credible evidence to show that so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior\nhappened, or it happened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not\ncast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.  MC 32(d) might apply\nif there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited to the passage of time\nwithout recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or restitution, job training or higher education, good\nemployment record, or constructive community involvement.  Some of Applicant\u2019s criminal conduct\ndates to the 1970s and 1980s, while other criminal conduct occurred as recently as 2005.  Applicant\u2019s\ncriminal activity is recent, and it also suggests a pattern of conduct, since it spans approximately 28\nyears, from 1977 to 2005.  There is no credible evidence in the record to indicate successful\nrehabilitation.  Applicant\u2019s criminal conduct raises serious doubts not only about his reliability,\ntrustworthiness, and good judgment but also about his ability to follow laws, rules, and regulations.\nApplicant failed to provide credible evidence under MC 32(a)  and MC 32(d) to mitigate the criminal\nconduct alleged in the SOR.  No other MCs apply.\nWhole Person Analysis\nIn addition to evaluating the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under each guideline, an\nadministrative judge must thoroughly consider and review all available reliable information about the\nappellant, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, to arrive at a balanced decision.  DoD\nRegulation 5200.2-R, Appendix 8, describes this process of scrutiny and evaluation as \u201cthe whole\nperson concept.\u201d  The factors to be considered in a whole person analysis include the nature, extent,\nand seriousness of the conduct; the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; the frequency and recency of the conduct; the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time\nof the conduct; the voluntariness of participation; the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\npertinent behavioral changes; the motivation for the conduct; the potential for pressure, coercion,\nexploitation, or duress; and, the likelihood for continuation or recurrence.\nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the record evidence establish that he failed to offer credible\nevidence of drug rehabilitation, and it is reasonable to conclude his drug-related conduct is likely to\nrecur, a situation that casts doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment.\nApplicant\u2019s criminal conduct spans a period of 28 years, and he offered no credible evidence of\nrehabilitation, also casting doubt on his trustworthiness.  Finally, Applicant deliberately misled the\nGovernment regarding his illegal drug use, and he used illegal drugs while holding a security\nclearance.  These actions cast serious doubts on his security worthiness.\nIn ISCR Case No. 98-0761 at 3 (Dec. 27, 1999), DOHA\u2019s Appeal Board states that an\nadministrative judge, in deciding an Applicant\u2019s security worthiness, \u201cmust consider the record as a\nwhole (Directive Section F.3.) and decide whether the favorable evidence outweighs the unfavorable\nevidence, or vice versa.\u201d  I have considered the record as a whole and have evaluated Applicant\u2019s\nconduct under the whole person concept of the Directive.  I conclude that Applicant has neither\nrebutted nor mitigated the security concerns raised by the allegations in the SOR, and he has not\ndemonstrated that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him a security clearance.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\n\n9\nThe following are my conclusions as to each allegation in the SOR:\nParagraph 1.: Guideline H:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a.  through 1.f:\nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2.: Guideline E.:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 2.a. through 2.c.:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 3.: Guideline J.:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 3.a. through 3.f.:\nAgainst Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.  Clearance\nis denied.\nJoan Caton Anthony\nAdministrative Judge \n",

DeLaney, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\nSeptember 18, 2008\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nTESTAN, Joseph, Administrative Judge:\nOn March 24, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued\na Statement of Reasons (SOR) to applicant detailing the security concerns under\nGuidelines J, H and E. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865,\nSafeguarding Classified Information Within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended;\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised\nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and\neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on April 8, 2008, and requested an\nAdministrative Determination by an Administrative Judge (AJ). Department Counsel\nissued a File of Relevant Material (FORM) on May 9, 2008. Applicant filed a response to\nthe FORM on June 23, 2008. The case was assigned to me on July 2, 2008. Based\nupon a review of the case file, pleadings, and exhibits, eligibility for access to classified\ninformation is denied.\n\n2\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 32 year old employee of a defense contractor.\nIn 1997, applicant was cited for a noise violation. He was found guilty and fined\n$60.00. In his response to the SOR, applicant stated he was the social chair of a\nfraternity, and \u201cpart of the duties of the acting social chair were to accept the charges for\nany noise violation at a fraternity held function and [he] did so without question.\u201d\nIn 1998, applicant was arrested and charged with Assault and Battery. He was\nconvicted of the charge, fined, placed on probation, and ordered to pay his victim\u2019s\nmedical expenses. In his response to the SOR, applicant stated this incident was the\nresult of him going to the aid of one of his fraternity brothers when he saw him \u201con the\nground on his back being beaten up by three unnamed men.\u201d \nIn November 1998, applicant received non-judicial punishment under Article 15 of\nthe UCMJ for assault on a superior officer. As a result, he was reduced in rank. In his\nresponse to the SOR, applicant stated this charge was the result of him accidentally\nsplashing hot coffee on the chest and face of his superior.\nIn November 1998, applicant was arrested and charged with Breaking and\nEntering with the Intent to Commit Assault and Battery. The Court placed him in a\ndiversion program and ordered him to serve 100 hours of community service. After\napplicant completed the community service, the charge was dismissed. In his response\nto the SOR, applicant admitted that he participated in a brawl with 16-20 fraternity\nbrothers and their associates, but believes he was \u201csingled out\u201d because he looked like\none of the other brawlers.\nIn October 1999, applicant was charged with Assault and Battery on his former\ngirlfriend. He was found not guilty of the charge.\nIn November 2000, applicant was arrested and charged with Shooting or\nThrowing Missiles at Occupied Vehicles, a felony. He pleaded guilty to the\nmisdemeanor charge of Property Damage and was fined $500.00. In his response to\nthe SOR, applicant stated this incident started with him throwing an empty soda can out\nof his car and ended with him colliding with a van. According to the driver of the van, the\nsoda can hit the van, causing him to lose control and collide with applicant\u2019s vehicle.\nApplicant has a different theory. He believes that the driver of the van became enraged\nafter being hit by the soda can and then sped up and rammed applicant\u2019s vehicle. \nIn November 2002, applicant was arrested for Driving While Intoxicated. He was\nfound guilty of the charge.\nApplicant used illegal steroids in 1997 and 1998, cocaine once in either 2001 or\n2002 and twice in 2004, and marijuana approximately ten times in 1999 and at least\nseven times between 2003-2006.\nApplicant completed an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing\n(e-QIP) on September 27, 2006. In response to Question 24, applicant indicated his\n\nThe SOR alleges applicant falsified material facts on a 2000 e-QIP when he failed to disclose his cocaine\n1\nuse. However, as Department Counsel concedes in the FORM, there is no evidence that applicant used\ncocaine prior to 2001. This allegation is therefore found for applicant.\n3\nillegal drug use had consisted of using marijuana ten times in 1999. This response was\nfalse because, as noted above, he had used marijuana between 2003 and 2006.1\nApplicant denies that he tried to mislead the DoD with his answer. In Exhibit 5, he stated\nhis omission was due to an \u201cunintentional oversight.\u201d In his response to the SOR, he\nappeared to be stating that his mistake was due to him simply copying the information\nhe provided on his 2000 e-QIP onto his 2006 e-QIP without updating it. He stated the\nfollowing:\nIn my effort to fill out the appropriate form in a timely manner I had pulled\nmy previous file from my first application, SF86, for Security Clearance.\nThis form did not have the new data on it as it was filled out in 2000. Once\nI realized my omission and mistake I immediately contacted my security\nofficer at the time who instructed me to simply make the statements during\nmy personal interview with my OPM Security Officer. I did so, initiating the\ndialogue proactively making all forthright statements about my previous\ndrug use during that face to face interview.\nWhen the information on applicant\u2019s 2000 e-QIP is compared to the information\non his 2006 e-QIP, this explanation is not credible. In response to a question about drug\nuse on his 2000 e-QIP, applicant stated he used marijuana 10 times from 1/1999 to\n3/1999. When he responded to the drug use question on his 2006 e-QIP, he stated he\nused marijuana 10 times from 2/1999 to 5/1999. In addition, he provided an explanation\nabout his marijuana use with his 2006 answer, something he did not do with his 2000\nanswer. The difference in dates and the added explanation belie applicant\u2019s explanation\nthat he simply copied the information from one e-QIP onto the other e-QIP. He clearly\nread the question and provided fresh information. Based on the foregoing, I find that\napplicant intentionally provided the false information. I further find his uncorroborated\nstatements (1) that he talked with his security officer about his \u201comission and mistake\u201d\nand was told to \u201csimply make the statements during [his] personal interview with [the]\nOPM Security Officer\u201d and (2) implying that he voluntarily disclosed his 2001-2003\nmarijuana use to the OPM investigator before being questioned about it, to be\nincredible.\nPolicies\nThe President has \u201cthe authority to . . . control access to information bearing on\nnational security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to\noccupy a position that will give that person access to such information.\u201d (Department of\nthe Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518,527 (1988).) In Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information Within Industry (February 20, 1960), the President set out\nguidelines and procedures for safeguarding classified information within the executive\nbranch. The President authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant\napplicants eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is\nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d (Exec. Ord. 10865, Section 2.)\n\n4\nTo be eligible for a security clearance, an applicant must meet the security\nguidelines contained in the Directive. Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth personnel\nsecurity guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions\nunder each guideline.\nInitially, the Government must present evidence to establish controverted facts in\nthe SOR that disqualify or may disqualify the applicant from being eligible for access to\nclassified information. (Directive, Paragraph E3.1.14.) Thereafter, the applicant is\nresponsible for presenting evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts.\n(Directive, Paragraph E3. 1.15.) An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating\nthat it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security\nclearance.\u201d (ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002).) \u201cAny doubt as to\nwhether access to classified information is clearly consistent with national security will\nbe resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d (Directive, Paragraph E2.2.2.)\nA person granted access to classified information enters into a special\nrelationship with the government. The government must be able to repose a high\ndegree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information. The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not a\ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant. (Exec. Ord. 10865, Section 7.) It is\nmerely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President\nhas established for issuing a clearance.\nAnalysis\nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct\nThe security concern for criminal conduct is set forth in Paragraph 30 of the AG,\nand is as follows:\nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and\ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person's ability\nor willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations.\nParagraph 31 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may\nbe disqualifying: Under Paragraph 31.a., \u201ca single serious crime or multiple lesser\noffenses\u201d may be disqualifying. And, under Paragraph 31.c., an \u201callegation or admission\nof criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was formally charged, formally\nprosecuted or convicted,\u201d may be disqualifying. Applicant\u2019s multiple convictions and his\nintentional misrepresentation of material facts on the 2006 e-QIP (a felony under 18\nU.S.C. 1001) raise these two disqualifying conditions.\nParagraph 32 of the AG sets forth conditions that could mitigate security\nconcerns. I have considered each of them and conclude none apply.\n\n5\nGuideline H:  Drug Involvement\nThe security concern for drug involvement is set forth in Paragraph 24 of the\nAG, and is as follows:\nUse of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because it may\nimpair judgment and because it raises questions about a person\u2019s ability\nor willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations.\nParagraph 25 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may\nbe disqualifying. Under Paragraph 25.a., \u201cany drug abuse\u201d may be disqualifying. This\ndisqualifying condition is applicable.\nParagraph 26 of the AG sets forth conditions that could mitigate security\nconcerns. Under Paragraph 26.a., it may be mitigating if \u201cthe behavior happened so\nlong ago, was so infrequent, or happened under such circumstances that it is unlikely to\nrecur or does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or\ngood judgment.\u201d Under Paragraph 26.b., it may be mitigating if there is \u201ca demonstrated\nintent not to abuse any drugs in the future,\u201d such as \u201cdisassociation from drug-using\nassociates and contacts,\u201d and \u201can appropriate period of abstinence.\u201d Applicant used last\nused an illegal drug, marijuana, in 2006. According to applicant, he had stopped using\nmarijuana in 1999, only to resume his use of it in 2003, long after he graduated from\ncollege, and after he had applied for a security clearance. The evidence does not\nsupport a finding that he is unlikely to use it again. I conclude that neither of these\nmitigating conditions is applicable. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set forth in\nParagraph 15 of the AG, and is as follows:\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful\nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other\nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\nParagraph16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be\ndisqualifying. Under Paragraph 16.a., the \u201cdeliberate omission, concealment, or\nfalsification of relevant facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history\nstatement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment\nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or\ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities,\u201d may be disqualifying. This\ndisqualifying condition is applicable because applicant intentionally provided false\nmaterial information on the e-QIP.\n\n6\nParagraph 17 sets forth conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I\nconsidered each of them and conclude none apply.\n\u201cWhole Person\u201d Analysis \nUnder the whole person concept, the AJ must evaluate an applicant\u2019s security\neligibility by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all the circumstances.\nAn AJ should consider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG Paragraph\n2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances\nsurrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and\nrecency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct;\n(5) extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the\nconduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the\nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d Under AG Paragraph 2c, the ultimate\ndetermination of whether to grant a security clearance must be an overall common\nsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines and the whole\nperson concept.       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is a mature man with a\nhistory of numerous arrests and convictions, illegal drug use, and dishonesty. Although\nhe appears to have started to straighten out his life, the various statements and\nexplanations he provided for most his criminal conduct, statements and explanations\nthat consistently and incredibly downplay his culpability and attempt to make him look\nlike an innocent victim of circumstances, together with his relatively recent intentional\nfalsification of material facts about his drug use on the e-QIP, and his relatively recent\nillegal drug use, indicate that he still has some work to do before he can be deemed\nsufficiently reliable and trustworthy to hold a security clearance. Applicant failed to\nmitigate the security concerns arising from Guidelines J, H and E.\nFormal Findings     \nFormal findings for or against applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline J: AGAINST APPLICANT\nParagraph 2, Guideline H: AGAINST APPLICANT\nParagraph 3, Guideline E: AGAINST APPLICANT\n\n7\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national security to grant applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n                                              \n_________________\nJOSEPH TESTAN\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Moreover, she falsified her public trust position application. Eligibility for \na public trust position and access to sensitive information is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted her Public Trust Position Application (SF 85P) (GE 1) on \nDecember 28, 2005. On July 18, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals \n(DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the Government\u2019s security \nconcerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) and Guideline E (Personal \nConduct).1  \n \n1  The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), Department of \nDefense (DoD) Regulation 5200.2-R, Personnel Security Program, dated Jan. 1987, as amended \n(Regulation), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December \n29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \nMarch 26, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                          \n  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on October 4 and November 19, 2007, and \nrequested a hearing before an Administrative Judge. The case was assigned to me on \nDecember 24, 2007. On January 3, 2008, Applicant requested a hearing date on the \nfirst week of February 2008, because she had just delivered a baby. DOHA issued a \nNotice of Hearing on January 16, 2008. I convened the hearing as scheduled on \nFebruary 8, 2008. The government offered exhibits (GE) 1 through 4, which were \nreceived without objection. Applicant testified on her own behalf and submitted exhibits \n(AE) 1 through 4, which were received without objection.2 DOHA received the transcript \nof the hearing (Tr.) on February 19, 2008.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nIn her Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted SOR \u00b6 1.a-1.c, 1.h, 1.i, and 1.o \nwith explanations. She denied the allegations in SOR \u00b6 1.d-1.g, 1.j-1.n, and 2a. Her \nadmissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a thorough review of the \nevidence, including Applicant\u2019s demeanor, I make the following additional findings of \nfact.  \n \nApplicant is a 28-year-old information technology engineer employed by a \ngovernment contractor. Applicant has had a difficult upbringing. At age nine, she was \nplaced in foster care due to her mother\u2019s drug abuse and neglect. At age 15, she had \nher first child. And, at age 17, she undertook the responsibility of raising two of her \nyounger sisters, then ages 11 and five.  \n \nShe married her spouse in February 1999. She currently has four children for \nwhom she provides care and support; her 13-year-old daughter, her 15-year-old autistic \nsister, a seven-year-old child in her foster care since around July 2007, and a one-\nmonth-old baby she just delivered (Tr. 71, 104). Applicant\u2019s State provides her with \nfinancial assistance for taking care of her autistic sister (approximately $650 a month), \nand for taking care of a foster child (approximately $1,300 a month) (Tr. 118). At the \ntime of the hearing, she was considering filing for divorce (Tr. 103). She is attending her \nsophomore year in college. \n \nApplicant\u2019s work history (GE 1) reflects she has been, for the most part, \nconsistently employed since August 1998 to the present as a typist, receptionist, clerical \nsupport, and office administrator. From November 2002 to July 2005, she worked for a \nfederal contractor as a word processor II. In December 2005, she was hired by her \ncurrent employer, a federal contractor, and requires access to sensitive information to \nperform her job. Since 1998, she has been unemployed during the following periods of \ntime: from July to December 2005, and from January to April 2000 (GE 1). \n \n \n \n2  AE 4 was submitted post-hearing. I kept the record open to allow Applicant time to submit additional \ndocumentation. Department Counsel\u2019s memorandum, stating no objections to me considering Applicant\u2019s \npost-hearing submission is included in AE 4. \n\n \n3 \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s background investigation addressed her financial situation and \nincluded the review of her April 2007 response to DOHA interrogatories (GE 2), and two \ncredit bureau reports (CBRs) from January 2006 (GE 4), and November 2006 (GE 3). \nThe SOR alleges 15 delinquent/charged off accounts totaling approximately $12,600. \nThe alleged debts are supported by the government\u2019s evidence.  \n \nApplicant and her husband acquired most of her delinquent/charged off debts \nwhen she was young and immature (around age 18), and was not aware of the adverse \nconsequences of having bad credit. She grew up alone, and with no adult supervision or \nmentoring. She and her husband opened credit card accounts, maxed out their credit, \nand never attempted to pay or resolve their debts (Tr. 50-52). It was not until July 2006, \nwhen she was confronted by a government investigator about her delinquent debts that \nshe realized the number and extent of her bad debts. Until then, she believed she only \nowed around $3,000 on bad debts (Tr. 57).  \n \nAfter her interview with the government investigator, Applicant claimed she \nbegan her attempts to resolve her bad debts by identifying the creditors (successor \ncollection agencies), and contacting some of the creditors to establish payment \nagreements. She presented no documentary evidence to support her claim. It was not \nuntil after receipt of the July 2007 SOR that she began her efforts to resolve her debts.  \n \nConcerning her charged off debts over seven years old (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.e), \nApplicant has elected not to contact those creditors and avail herself of the protection of \nthe stature of limitations. She was told by a credit consultant that if she was to contact \nthose creditors, they would re-open the charged off accounts and charge her with \nadditional fees, interests, and penalties.  \n \nApplicant claims to have an off-and-on relationship with her husband. Through \nout their years together, he has provided limited or no financial support to Applicant or \nher children. She averred most of her financial problems are due to his taking her \nmoney and not paying for rent, mortgage, and other debts. Since they have been \ntogether, they have been evicted at least three times for their failure to pay rent. In \n2000, Applicant and her husband purchased two time share properties. She claimed \nshe was paying for one, and she believes her husband is not paying for the other time \nshare (Tr. 98-99). She was trying to sell her time share property.  \n \nIn July 2006, Applicant and her husband purchased a $305,000 home with a \nmonthly mortgage of $2,900. In October 2007, she stopped making mortgage payments \nbecause she did not have the money, and the mortgage is in default. As of her hearing, \nshe had the home under contract on a \u201cshort sale\u201d (AE 4). The short sale would pay for \nthe first mortgage, but would not cover the $60,000 second mortgage. She claimed the \nsecond mortgage holder told her they would not come after her for the $60,000 she \nwould owe after defaulting on the second mortgage (Tr. 88-91, 114). She presented no \nevidence, other than her testimony, to corroborate this claim. \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s monthly income fluctuates because she does not work 40-hour weeks \nconsistently. When she is allowed to work 40-hour weeks her take home pay is around \n$2,400 a month. Since July 2007, she has not been able to work 40-hour weeks \nbecause of health problems, and she is not entitled to paid sick leave or vacations. She \nstopped working completely around November 2007 due to her pregnancy. She was \nsupposed to start working again during the later part of February 2008. She has been \nusing some of her autistic sister\u2019s and foster child money to pay for daily expenses and \nher current debts.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s evidence shows she made the following payments (AE 4): (1) two \n$40 payments in November 2007 and February 2008 allegedly to the debt collector for \nSOR \u00b6 1.h; (2) in February 2008, she made a $50 payment to the collector of the debt in \nSOR \u00b6 1.o; (3) one $50 payment to the creditor in SOR \u00b6 1.c; (4) apparently, in \nFebruary 2008, she refinanced the delinquent debt in SOR 1.b, and now has a current \ndebt of $2,245; (5) concerning SOR 1.i (unpaid judgment from December 2002, for a \nbounced check) on February 29, 2008, she agreed to pay $40 monthly for a debt now \nowing $1,481; (6) concerning SOR \u00b6 1.l, she offered to pay $265 in March 25, 2008 to \nsettle this debt; and, (7) concerning SOR \u00b6 1.m, she made arrangements to return past \ndue cable TV equipment to the provider. She claimed she has not been able to identify \nthe collectors for the delinquent debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d, 1.g, 1.k, and 1.n. \n \nThree of these debts are related to medical bills which she failed to pay and now \nclaims she cannot identify either the provider or the debt collector. Ten of the delinquent \ndebts listed could be considered small debts because the total owed per debt is less \nthan $1,000. She plans to pay any remaining delinquent debts using her 2008 income \ntax refund. She claimed she talked to a debt consolidation service once, but elected not \nto use their services. She has never received or participated in any financial counseling. \n \nApplicant raised numerous factors that could be considered mitigating \ncircumstances that prevented her from paying her debts, i.e., being a single mother, \ninadequate or lack of financial support from her husband, medical and health problems, \nproviding care and support for four children, and fluctuating or inadequate income.  \n \nApplicant stated numerous times her willingness to pay her delinquent debts; \nhowever, at the present she cannot afford to do so. Her income is not sufficient to pay \nfor her debts and her day-to-day living expenses. Applicant presented no evidence of \nany measures she has taken to avoid future financial difficulties. She did not seek or \nreceive any financial counseling. Applicant\u2019s references consider her strong-minded, \nconsiderate, and loyal. Her references confirm most of her current problems were \ncaused by her husband\u2019s neglect and lack of financial support.  \n \nIn December 2005, Applicant submitted a public trust position application (GE 1). \nIn response to question 20 (asking whether she was or had ever been 180 days \ndelinquent on any loan or financial obligation), she answered \u201cNo,\u201d and deliberately \nfailed to disclose her delinquent debts identified in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.1-1.n. \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \n                                                          \nApplicant offered several explanations for her failure to disclose the required \ninformation, i.e., she misunderstood the questions, she did not understand the security \nclearance process, she was not aware of a lot of the delinquent debts, she believed \nsome of the debts were paid by her husband, a credit consultant told her to disregard \ndebts over seven years delinquent, and when she answered \u201cNo,\u201d she did not mean to \nsay she had no delinquent debts (Tr. 37-38, 42).  \n \nPolicies \n \nPositions designated as ADP I and ADP II are classified as \u201csensitive positions.\u201d3 \n\u201cThe standard that must be met for . . . assignment to sensitive duties is that, based on \nall available information, the person\u2019s loyalty, reliability, and trustworthiness are such \nthat . . . assigning the person to sensitive duties is clearly consistent with the interests of \nnational security.\u201d4 The Deputy Under Secretary of Defense (Counterintelligence and \nSecurity) Memorandum, dated November 19, 2004, indicates trustworthiness \nadjudications will apply to cases forwarded to DOHA by the Defense Security Service \nand Office of Personnel Management.  Department of Defense contractor personnel are \nafforded the right to the procedures contained in the Directive before any final \nunfavorable access determination may be made.5  \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a public trust position, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s controlling \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d6 In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \n \n3  See Regulation \u00b6\u00b6 C3.1.2.1.1.7 and C3.1.2.1.2.3.   \n \n4  See Regulation \u00b6 C6.1.1.1. \n \n5  See Regulation \u00b6 C8.2.1.    \n \n6  See Department of the Army v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528, 531 (1988). \n\n \n6 \n \n \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \n \nUnder Guideline F, the trustworthiness concern is that an Applicant\u2019s  \n \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds. AG \u00b6 18. \n \n \nAs of her hearing day, Applicant had 15 delinquent debts, including a judgment \nwhich had been charged off or in collection for many years, totaling approximately \n$12,600. AG \u00b6 19(a) (inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts), AG \u00b6 19(c) (a history of \nnot meeting financial obligations), and AG \u00b6 19(e) (consistent spending beyond one\u2019s \nmeans . . .), apply in this case.  \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \n                                                          \n \nAG & 20 lists six conditions that could mitigate the financial considerations \nsecurity concerns. After considering all the mitigating conditions (MC), and the record \nevidence as a whole,7 I conclude that none of the mitigating conditions fully apply. \nApplicant presented little evidence of efforts taken to contact creditors, or to resolve any \nof the debts since she acquired them up to the date she received the SOR. Nor is there \nany evidence that she has participated in any financial counseling.  \n \n \nI specifically considered AG \u00b6 20(b) (\u201cThe conditions that resulted in the financial \nproblem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances)\u201d and AG \u00b6 20(d) (\u201cthe individual \ninitiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts\u201d), and \nconclude that they apply, but only to a limited extent.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s testimony raised mitigating factors that may be considered as \ncircumstances beyond her control contributing to her inability to pay her debts, i.e., she \nwas a single mother at age 15, received inadequate or no financial support from her \nhusband, medical and health problems, providing care and support to four children, and \nfluctuating or inadequate income.  \n \nThese claims demonstrate circumstances beyond her control; however, \nApplicant\u2019s evidence is not sufficient to show she has dealt responsibly with her \nfinancial obligations. She presented little evidence to show paid debts, settlement \nagreements, \ndocumented \nnegotiations, \npayment \nplans, \nbudgets, \nfinancial \nassistance/counseling from the day she acquired the debts to the day she received the \nSOR. Conversely, the evidence shows she maxed out her credit card accounts, \npurchased a vehicle, two time shares, bought a $300,000 home, and indulged in other \nluxuries without regard to her delinquent obligations. Applicant\u2019s failure to pay or resolve \na December 2002 judgment filed against her for a bounced check until after her DOHA \nhearing shows her lack of financial responsibility. \n \n \nRegarding AG \u00b6 20(d), I considered all of Applicant\u2019s recent efforts to pay or \nresolve her delinquent obligations. Notwithstanding, Applicant\u2019s last minute efforts to \npay long delinquent debts, and to make payment arrangements to pay other debts, do \nnot constitute good-faith efforts to resolve her debts. Applicant failed to establish a track \nrecord of financial responsibility, that she received financial counseling, or that the \nproblem is being resolved or is under control (AG \u00b6 20(c)). She also failed to show that \nshe properly disputed the legitimacy of any of the debts (AG \u00b6 20(e)). Based on the \navailable evidence, her financial problems are recent, not isolated, ongoing, and are \nlikely to be a concern in the future.  \n \n \n7  See ISCR Case No. 03- 02374 at 4 (App. Bd. Jan. 26, 2006) (citing ISCR Case No. 02-22173 at 4 (App. \nBd. May 26, 2004)). When making a recency analysis for FC MC 1, all debts are considered as a whole. \n\n \n8 \n \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions about an \nindividual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. Of \nspecial interest is any failure to provide truthful and candid answers during the security \nclearance process or any other failure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \nAG & 15. \n \nThe record evidence established Applicant deliberately failed to disclose relevant \ninformation in her answers to question 20 of her public trust application. Numerous \nfactors weighed in my analysis to reach that conclusion, including: Applicant=s age, her \nlevel of education, her employment history, her demeanor and testimony, the number \nand value of the debts, her long term disregard of the debts, and the lack of credibility of \nher excuses. She knew or should have known the importance of accurate completion of \nher public trust position application, and nevertheless failed to provide information that \nwas material to making an informed trustworthiness determination. Disqualifying \nConditions (DC) 16(a): deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant \nfacts from any personnel security questionnaire . . ., and DC 16(e): personal conduct or \nconcealment of information about one=s conduct, that creates a vulnerability to \nexploitation, manipulation, or duress . . ., apply. \n \nI specifically considered all Guideline E Mitigating Conditions (MC) and conclude \nthat none apply. Applicant=s falsification is recent, and her favorable information is not \nsufficient to apply any of the MCs. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a),  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d Under AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon \ncareful consideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \n\n \n9 \n \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is a mature, hard-working \nwoman. She has been successful working since at least 1998 as a clerk, typist, and \noffice assistant. She has worked for defense contractors for approximately five years. \nShe is a dedicated mother who takes care of her children, her sister, and a foster child.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence fails to convince me of Applicant\u2019s eligibility and \nsuitability for a public trust position. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant failed to \nmitigate the trustworthiness concerns arising from her financial considerations and \npersonal conduct.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.o:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a :  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a public trust \nposition. Eligibility for access to sensitive information is denied. \n \n \n \n \n_________________ \nJUAN J. RIVERA \nAdministrative Judge \n",

DOHA acted under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified\nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense\nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program\n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG).\n.\nApplicant timely responded to the SOR, denied all allegations in the SOR with\nexplanation, and requested a hearing. DOHA assigned the case to me on July 26, 2010.\nDOHA issued a Notice of Hearing on September 10, 2010. Department Counsel offered\nfour exhibits, which were admitted without objection as Government Exhibits (GE) 1-4.\nApplicant testified and presented eight exhibits, which were admitted without objection\nas Applicant Exhibits (AE) A-H. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) On October 18,\n2010. Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility\nfor access to classified information is granted.\nNovember 19, 2010\n\n2\nFindings of Fact\nUnder Guideline M, the government alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a that Applicant\nintentionally used (reconfigured and installed) a wireless router that exceeded\nauthorized access to the internet computer networks in about November or December\n2003, while employed with a defense contractor. In SOR \u00b6 1.b, the government alleged\nin about December 2003, Applicant was investigated by the Office of the Inspector\nGeneral and found in violation of SSC-Network Policy, section 4.3.3, \u201cWireless Devices\u201d\nand 18 U.S.C. Section 1030, \u201cFraud and Related Activity in Connection with\nComputers\u201d.\nUnder Guideline E, the government alleged in SOR \u00b6 2.a the same information\nalleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a and 1.b.\nUnder Guideline J, the government alleged in SOR \u00b6 3.a the same information as\nalleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a. In SOR \u00b6 3.b the government alleged that information alleged in\nSOR \u00b6 1.b constitutes a violation of Federal law, Title 18 U.S.C. Section 1001, a felony.\nAfter a thorough review of the pleadings, and exhibits, I make the following findings of\nfact.\nApplicant is 37 years old. Applicant served in the U.S. military from 1991 until\n1996, and held a security clearance since approximately 1995. (GE 1) He graduated\nfrom college in 2001, and received his Master of Business Administration degree in\n2007 (AE E). He is divorced and has no children. (Tr. 23)\nApplicant has worked as an engineer (civilian employee) since approximately\n1997 various contractors. He is currently a key management employee of his own\ncompany. (Tr. 24) The company is a service-disabled veteran-owned company. (AE C). \nIn December 2003, while employed with a defense contractor, Applicant installed\na wireless router in a cubicle space based on the request of Applicant\u2019s co-worker, who\nwas a government employee. Applicant\u2019s co-worker purchased the router because the\npersonnel working in that area could not access network resources to accomplish their\njobs. (GE 1) \nOn December 31, 2003, a report of a suspicious person outside the military\ncompound that may have been trying to gain access or gain a signal from a government\nagency came to light. The report of the incident led to an inspection of the work area\nwhere Applicant and his co-worker had installed the wireless router. In January 2004,\nthe router was discovered. Applicant\u2019s employer removed the router. At the time,\nApplicant was on vacation.\nApplicant was interviewed concerning the installation of the wireless router and\nabout the location of the wireless router. Applicant explained that he found an elevated\nplace between cubicles and that there was no other place that would work quite as well.\nHe explained he was not aware of any policy that prohibited the installation of a wireless\nrouter. He also acknowledged that was not a good excuse. He also stated that the\n\n3\nrouter gave him access to the same resources (files) that he had already been allowed\nto access. (Tr. 37) The interviewer\u2019s comment was \u201cthat Applicant\u2019s explanation was not\npersuasive.\u201d Applicant further explained that he did what he thought necessary by\nsetting an encryption feature on the device so all wireless traffic to and from the device\nwould be secured. (GE 1)\nAn investigation conducted by Applicant\u2019s employer resulted in a report\ngenerated in July 2004. The report revealed that Applicant\u2019s government co-worker\nshowed poor judgment by asking Applicant to install and reconfigure a wireless router.\nApplicant\u2019s co-worker knew or should have known that this was against policy and put\nApplicant in \u201can unacceptable position.\u201d It clearly noted that Applicant acted on the\nrequest and advice of the long-term government employee. However, Applicant as an\nengineer in the filed \u201cshowed a lack of concern for the network and information\ntechnology systems security.\u201d He did not show due diligence in protecting the wireless\naccess point itself, its wireless clients, and ultimately the command network.\nPersons who are found to be involved in \u201cexceeding unauthorized access\u201d to a\ncomputer or network may be prosecuted under 18 U.S.C. Section 1030, \u201cFraud and\nRelated Activity in connection with Computers,\u201d which is a felony charge. The incident in\nthis case was referred to the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for potential prosecution. (GE 4)\nAs a result of the investigation, Applicant was reprimanded by his employer. He\nwas advised that there would be no criminal prosecution. The report noted that the\nagency has not finalized a regulation addressing wireless security policy. Since its\nestablishment in 2001, however, wireless security policy for the SSC has been clearly\ndelineated and readily available on the command Intranet. \nApplicant was candid and forthcoming at the hearing. He was credible in his\nexplanation of the events that occurred. He was asked to help his government co-\nworker, who had been working there for 20 years, solve a problem and he offered to\ninstall the wireless router. The co-worker did not express knowledge of network security\npolicy. Applicant received good evaluations that year and continued to work in that\ncapacity until 2006. (Tr. 76)\nApplicant submitted ten letters of recommendation from supervisors and\ncolleagues from 1992 until 2006. Each describes him as a person of excellent\ncharacter. He is professional and tenacious. He possesses expert knowledge. Former\nprogram managers describe Applicant as a person who is an enthusiastic engineer with\nexcellent communication skills. He is a joy to work with. Applicant is  detail oriented and\ndetermined. He is a critical member of the team. He delivered extraordinary technical\nsupport and management expertise to the program. Applicant resolves problems\nquickly. He has demonstrated a rare combination of exceptional technical skill,\ninnovative problem solving and superior organizational skills that have led directly to the\nsuccess in the project. He understands the technical issues and the military\norganization and environment. (AE D)\n\n Directive. 6.3.\n1\n Commonly referred to as the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept, these factor are: (1) the nature, extent, and\n2\nseriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual's age and maturity at the time\nof the conduct; (5) the extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation\nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\n See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988).\n3\n4\nApplicant earned awards and letters of appreciation during his military career. He\ngraduated from a specialized manager course with distinction. He is and has maintained\nstrict responsibility and accountability for a great deal of secret information. \nApplicant acknowledged that in retrospect, he should have received written\npermission from someone in the government before installing a wireless router.\nHowever, he was trying to help his \u201ccustomer\u201d and to provide service. He had no\nmalicious intent in the use of the wireless router. He realizes that he should have\nresearched the issue to find specific policies that were applicable. Applicant testified\ncredibly that at the time he was not aware of the existing policy section affecting\nwireless routers (4.3.3). He admitted that he learned a lesson from the incident and that\nhe is sure it will not happen again.\nPolicies\nEach security clearance decision must be a fair, impartial, and commonsense\ndetermination based on examination of all available relevant and material information,\nand consideration of the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in the adjudicative\nguidelines (AG).  Decisions must also reflect consideration of the factors listed in \u00b6 2(a)\n1\nof the AG.  The presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating conditions is not\n2\ndeterminative of a conclusion for or against an applicant. However, specific applicable\nguidelines must be followed whenever a case can be measured against them as they\nrepresent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of a clearance. In this case, the\npleadings and the information presented by the parties require consideration of the\nsecurity concerns and adjudicative factors addressed under Guideline M (misuse of\ninformation technology systems), at AG \u00b6 39, Guideline E (personal conduct) at AG \u00b6\n15, and Guideline J (criminal conduct) at AG \u00b6 30.\nA security clearance decision is intended to resolve whether it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest  for an applicant to either receive or continue to\n3\nhave access to classified information. The government bears the initial burden of\nproducing admissible information on which it based the preliminary decision to deny or\nrevoke a security clearance for an applicant. Additionally, the government must be able\nto prove controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If the government meets its burden, it\nthen falls to the applicant to refute, extenuate or mitigate the government\u2019s case.\nBecause no one has a right to a security clearance, an applicant bears a burden of\n\n See Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, 531.\n4\n See Egan; Revised Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 2(b).\n5\n5\npersuasion.  A person who has access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\n4\nrelationship with the government based on trust and confidence. The government,\ntherefore, has a compelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite\njudgement, reliability and trustworthiness of one who will protect the national interests.\nThe \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any\nreasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the government.5\nAnalysis\nMisuse of Information Technology Systems.\nUnder Guideline M, \u201c[n]oncompliance with rules, procedures, guidelines, or\nregulations pertaining to information technology systems\u201d may raise security concerns\nabout an individual's reliability and trustworthiness, calling into question the willingness\nor ability to properly protect sensitive systems, networks, and information. Information\nTechnology Systems include all related computer hardware, software, firmware, and\ndata used for the communication, transmission, processing, manipulation, storage, or\nprotection of information.\u201d (AG \u00b6 39). Applicant acknowledged that in 2003, he installed\nand reconfigured a wireless router which exceeded authorized access to a government\nclassified network. The information requires consideration of the disqualifying conditions\nlisted at AG \u00b6 40(a) (illegal or unauthorized entry into any information technology\nsystem or component thereof); AG 40(c) (use of any information technology system to\ngain unauthorized access to another system or to a compartmented area within the\nsame system); AG \u00b6 40(e) (unauthorized use of a government or other information\ntechnology system) and \u00b6 40(f) (introduction, removal, or duplication of hardware,\nfirmware, software, or media to or from any information technology system without\nauthorization, when prohibited by rules, procedures, guidelines, or regulations).\nI find that AG \u00b6\u00b6 40(a), 40(c), 40(e), and 40 (f) apply because a router is an\ninformation technology system that was used to gain unauthorized access to a\nclassified network in violation of information technology rules, procedure, or guidelines. \nThe record supports consideration of Guideline M mitigating conditions listed in\nAG \u00b6 41. This conduct occurred in December 2003. Applicant explained that he was\nrequested to install the router purchased by his government co-worker to help alleviate\na situation. He complied with the request. He was not aware of a policy that prohibited\nthe wireless router. He used means to encrypt the system.  He believed this would allow\na more efficient use of time. Applicant was on vacation and when he returned the\nwireless router was confiscated. He cooperated with the investigation. He was\ncounseled or reprimanded by his employer. He continued to work as a contractor and\nhe received letters of appreciation for his work. He then read the relevant policy. He\nnow realized that it was imprudent to follow the request of his government co-worker\nwithout researching the issue and obtaining approval. Applicant has held a security\n\n6\nclearance during his Navy service and as a contractor without any other incident.  (AG \u00b6\n41(a) (so much time has elapsed since the behavior happened, or it happened under\nsuch unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the\nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment) applies. The other mitigating\nconditions are not applicable.\nPersonal Conduct.\nThe security concern about Applicant\u2019s personal conduct, as expressed in the\nAG \u00b6 15, is that \u201c[c]onduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty,\nor unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions about an\nindividual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information.\u201d \nAs to SOR \u00b6 2.b, available information requires consideration of the disqualifying\nconditions listed in AG \u00b6 16(d)(4) (evidence of significant misuse of Government or\nother employer\u2019s time or resources) and AG \u00b6 16(e)(1) (personal conduct, or\nconcealment of information about ones\u2019 conduct, that creates a vulnerability to\nexploitation, manipulation, or duress, such as (1) engaging in activities which, if known,\nmay affect the person\u2019s personal, professional, or community standing). Certainly,\nApplicant\u2019s violation of company policy by unauthorized installation of a router over a\nsensitive network is conduct a person might wish to conceal, as it adversely affects a\nperson\u2019s professional and community standing.\nThe mitigating conditions outlined in AG \u00b6 17 (c) (the offense is so minor, or so\nmuch time has passed, or the behavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such\nunique circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the\nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment); AG \u00b6 17(d) (the individual has\nacknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling to change the behavior or taken\nother positive steps to alleviate the stressors, circumstances, or factors that caused\nuntrustworthy, unreliable or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely\nto recur) and AG \u00b6 17(e) (the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate\nvulnerability, to exploitation, manipulation, or duress) apply. Applicant acknowledged\nthat he installed the wireless router as discussed above under Guideline M. This\nincident occurred in 2003. Applicant has held a security clearance for many years. He\ncooperated with the investigation after the complaint was made. He did not alert his\nemployer because he was on vacation and the router was already confiscated when he\nreturned to work. Applicant takes responsibility for his actions.\nCriminal Conduct.\nThe security concerns about Applicant\u2019s criminal conduct, as expressed in the\nAG \u00b6 30, is that \u201ccriminal activity creates doubt about a persons\u2019 judgment, reliability,\nand trustworthiness, By its very nature, it calls into question a persons\u2019s ability or\nwillingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations.\u201d\nAG \u00b6 31(a) (a single serious crime or multiple lesser offense) is an applicable\ndisqualifying condition.  \n\n See footnote 2, supra.\n6\n7\nAG \u00b6 31(c) (allegation or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether\nthe person was formally charged, formally prosecuted or convicted) is an applicable\ndisqualifying condition. However, after an investigation, never presented to the U.S.\nAttorney\u2019s Office, the office did not prosecute Applicant. Applicant was reprimanded by\nhis employer for the installation of the wireless router. He read the applicable policy\nafter the incident and then complied with the policy.\nTitle 18, U.S.C. Section 1030 requires \u201cintent to defraud, reckless damage or\nintent to extort among other things. In this case, Applicant did not present the required\nintent. Thus, he is not in violation of the statute. \nAn applicant might be able to mitigate Guideline J security concerns. One such\nmitigating condition (so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened,\nor it happened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does\nnot cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment), AG \u00b6\n32(a) may apply. For the reasons discussed above, I do not believe Applicant would\ncompromise national security to avoid public disclosure of the incident. Any criminal\nconduct security concerns pertaining to the incident are dealt with more thoroughly\nunder Guideline M and Guideline E in this decision. Criminal conduct security concerns\nare mitigated. \nWhole- Person Concept. \nI have evaluated the facts presented in this record and have applied the\nappropriate adjudicative factors, pro and con, under Guidelines M, E, and J. I have also\nreviewed the record before me in the context of the whole-person factors listed in \u00b6 AG\n2(a).  Applicant is a mature adult who served in the military. He held a security\n6\nclearance for many years. However, when working for a defense contractor in 2003, he\ninstalled a wireless router at the request of a government employee in violation of a\npolicy against such wireless routers. He acknowledges his mistake and is sorry for the\nincident. The positive information about Applicant is sufficient to overcome the adverse\ninformation about his conduct at his previous job under Guideline M and Guideline E.\nThis does not raise doubts about his reliability and trustworthiness. He has mitigated the\nsecurity concerns under the above-referenced guidelines. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by section\nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline M:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\n\n8\nParagraph 2, Guideline E:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 3, Guideline J:\nFOR Applicant\nSubparagraph 3.a-3b:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the foregoing, it is clearly consistent with the national interest to\ngrant Applicant access to classified information.

He works for the U.S. Air Force there, and has the complete support of his\nchain of command.  His wife is an elementary school teacher.  The Applicant\u2019s 69 year old father-in-\nlaw, has been retired for 24 years.  He worked as a clerk at Korea\u2019s intelligence agency.  He has\n\u201cvery limited knowledge of . . .

Mitigation is shown.  Clearance is granted.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn January 10, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to\nExecutive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2,\n1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant, which detailed the reasons why DOHA\ncould not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant and\nrecommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether a clearance should be denied\nor revoked.\nApplicant filed an Answer to the SOR on January 29, 2007.\nThe case was received by the undersigned on April 25, 2007.  A notice of hearing was issued\non May 1, 2007, and the case was heard on May 23, 2007.  The Government submitted documentary\nevidence.  Testimony was taken from the Applicant, who also submitted documentary evidence.  The\ntranscript (TR) was received on June 5, 2007.  The issues raised here are whether the Applicant's\nperceived Foreign Influence militates against the granting of a security clearance.  [The Applicant\nadmits the underlying factual basis of all of the allegations.]\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nThe following Findings of Fact are based on Applicant's Answer to the SOR, the documents\nand the live testimony.  The Applicant is 35 years of age, and is employed by a defense contractor\nwho seeks a security clearance on behalf of the Applicant.  After a complete and thorough review\nof the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of the same, I make the following\nadditional Findings of Fact.\nGuideline B - Foreign Influence\nThe Applicant came to the U.S. with his family at the age of 14 (TR at page 45 lines 4~5, and\nGovernment Exhibit (GX) 1 at page 5).  He was naturalized as a U.S. citizen in January of 1992,\nmore than 15 years ago (TR at page 28 lines 10~18, and GX 1 at page 1).  He currently works for\nthe U.S. Air force in Korea (GX 1 at page 2).  In five years he intends to return to the U.S. with his\n\n3\nfamily, where he owns property worth about $350,000 (TR at page 47 lines 5~9, and at page 49 line\n22 to page 50 line 4).\n1.a.  The Applicant\u2019s wife, who has permanent resident status in the U.S., lives with the\nApplicant in Korea (TR at page 47 line 15 to page 50 line 4, and Applicant\u2019s Exhibit (AppX) B at\npages 7~8).  She is an elementary school teacher (Id).\n1.b. and 1.c.  The Applicant\u2019s 69 year old father-in-law, has been retired for 24 years (TR at\npage 50 line 15 to page 51 line 15, and AppX B at pages 9~10).  He worked as a clerk at Korea\u2019s\nintelligence agency (Id).  He has \u201cvery limited knowledge of . . . [his] son-in-law\u2019s occupation\u201d\n(AppX B at pages 9~10).  He has limited contact with his son-in-law (Id).  The Applicant\u2019s mother-\nin-law has always \u201cbeen a housewife\u201d (TR at page 50 lines 6~14).  She also avers as to their limited\ncontact with their son-in-law (AppX B at pages 11~12)  The Applicant has no dealings with two\nbrother-in-laws, who are only step brothers to the Applicant\u2019s wife (TR at page 37 lines 23~24, and\nat page 51 lines 20~25).  However, the Applicant also has four sister-in-laws (TR at page 41 line 25\nto page 42 line 6, and at page 52 lines 1~25).  One sister-in-law is an elementary school teacher, and\nthe other three are \u201chousewives\u201d (Id).\nAs the Applicant\u2019s wife and in-laws are citizens of and reside in South Korea, Korea must\nalso be considered.  South Korea is a highly developed, stable, democratic republic.  Its government\nhas generally respected the human rights of its citizens.  In the past 30 years, Korea has experienced\nextraordinary economic growth and possesses the eleventh-largest economy in the world.  Despite\nKorea\u2019s prominence as the seventh largest trading partner with the U.S., some Koreans are critical\nof U.S. policies and the presence of the U.S. military in their country.  Korea also has a long,\nongoing history of collecting protected U.S. information.  South Korean collection activities are\nevidenced by criminal prosecution linking espionage as directly involving the Korean government.\nPOLICIES\nEnclosure 2 and Section E.2.2. of the 1992 Directive set forth both policy factors, and\nconditions that could raise or mitigate a security concern.  Furthermore, as set forth in the Directive,\neach clearance decision must be a fair and impartial common sense determination based upon\nconsideration of all the relevant and material information and the pertinent criteria and adjudication\npolicy in enclosure 2, including as appropriate:\na. Nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct, and surrounding\ncircumstances.\nb. Frequency and recency of the conduct.\nc. Age and maturity of the applicant.\nd. Motivation of the applicant, and the extent to which the conduct\nwas negligent, willful, voluntary, or undertaken with knowledge of\nthe consequence involved.\n\n4\ne. Absence or presence of rehabilitation.\nf. Probability that circumstances or conduct will continue or recur in\nthe future.\u201d\nThe Administrative Judge, however, can only draw those inferences or conclusions that have\na reasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record.  The Judge cannot draw inferences or\nconclusions based on evidence that is speculative or conjectural in nature.\nThe Government must make out a case under Guideline B (Foreign Influence), which\nestablishes doubt about a person's judgment, reliability and trustworthiness.  While a rational\nconnection, or nexus, must be shown between an applicant's adverse conduct and his ability to\neffectively safeguard classified information, with respect to sufficiency of proof of a rational\nconnection, objective or direct evidence is not required.\nThen, the Applicant must remove that doubt with substantial evidence in refutation,\nexplanation, mitigation or extenuation, which demonstrates that the past adverse conduct is unlikely\nto be repeated, and that the Applicant presently qualifies for a security clearance.\nAn individual who is subject to Foreign Influence, may be prone to provide information or\nmake decisions that are harmful to the interests of the United States.  The Government must be able\nto place a high degree of confidence in a security clearance holder to abide by all security rules and\nregulations at all times and in all places.\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe Applicant's wife, and in-laws reside in Korea..  The first and second disqualifying\nconditions are arguably applicable as this contact \u201ccreates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation,\ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion,\" and creates \u201ca potential conflict of interests\nbetween the individual\u2019s obligation to protect sensitive information or technology and the\nindividual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person . . . by providing that information.\u201d  Under the facts of\nthis particular case, however, these are clearly countered by the first and second mitigating\nconditions.  The nature of the Applicant\u2019s relationship with his Korean relatives is \u201csuch that it is\nunlikely the individual will be placed in a position of having to choose between the interests of . .\n. [his family] and the interests of the U.S.\u201d  Also, the Applicant \u201chas such deep and longstanding\nrelationships and loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any conflict of\ninterest in favor of the U.S. interest.\u201d\nFurthermore, I am not limited to the mitigating conditions, delineated in the Directive, in\ndeciding if an Applicant has demonstrated extenuation or mitigation.  The Applicant\u2019s U.S. Air\nForce chain of command aver that he is trustworthy (Appellant\u2019s Exhibit B at pages 1~6).  The\ntotality of the Applicant\u2019s conduct and circumstances, as set forth at length above, clearly warrants\na favorable recommendation under the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d  Mitigation is shown.  Guideline B\nis found for the Applicant.\nConsidering all the evidence, the Applicant has rebutted the Government's case regarding his\n\n5\nperceived Foreign Influence.  The Applicant has thus met the mitigating conditions of Guideline B,\nand of Section E.2.2. of the Directive.  Accordingly, he has met his ultimate burden of persuasion\nunder Guideline B.\n\n6\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal Findings required by paragraph 25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive are:\nParagraph 1: Foreign Influence\nFOR THE APPLICANT\na.   For the Applicant.\nb.   For the Applicant.\nc.   For the Applicant.\nFactual support and reasons for the foregoing are set forth in FINDINGS OF FACT and\nCONCLUSIONS, supra.\nDECISION\nIn light of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly consistent with\nthe national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant.\nRichard A.

Nagel, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nMASON, Paul J., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted her Security Clearance Application (SCA), on June 8, 2005.\nOn October 11, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under foreign preference\n(Guideline C) and foreign influence (Guideline B). The action was taken pursuant to\nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February\n20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial\nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended\n(Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President\non December 29, 2005, and made effective within the Department of Defense for SORs\nissued on or after September 1, 2006. \nApplicant submitted her answer to the SOR on November 12, 2007. She elected\nto have her case decided administratively without a hearing. A copy of the government\u2019s\nFile of Relevant Material (FORM, the government\u2019s evidence in support of the SOR)\nwas sent to Applicant on February 5, 2008. Applicant received the FORM on February\n26, 2008. Applicant\u2019s response was due by March 26, 2008. No response was received.\nApril 30, 2008\n\n2\nThe case was assigned to this administrative judge on April 17, 2008. Based upon a\nreview of the FORM, Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nFindings of Fact\nApplicant admitted all allegations under paragraph 1 (foreign preference) and\nparagraph 2 (foreign influence). Applicant is 55 years old, married since 1972, and has\nbeen employed since 1981 as a specialist assembler for a defense contractor. She\nseeks a security clearance. \nForeign Preference (FP)\nUnder module 3 of her SCA (Item 4) that she completed and certified in June\n2005, Applicant entered information about her citizenship status in the United States\n(U.S.). Applicant indicated she became a naturalized U.S. citizen in December 2000.\nShe also indicated she had never held a U.S. passport. She answered \u201cyes\u201d to the last\nquestion under module 3 that she is a dual citizen (SOR 1.a.) of the U.S. and Mexico.\nUnder module 15 (in the last 7 years, have you had an active passport issued by a\nforeign government?), Applicant answered \u201cNo.\u201d\nApplicant provided a sworn statement to an investigator of the Office of\nPersonnel Management (OPM) on June 25, 2007. She was asked to provide\ninformation about her citizenship and the circumstances surrounding her detention or\narrest in March 1988 for alien smuggling. She and her husband maintain dual\ncitizenship with Mexico because they may want to retire (SOR 1.b.) in the country\nsomeday. Applicant voted in a Mexican election in 2006, and planned to vote in 2007\n(SOR 1.c.) because it is the best way to maintain Mexican citizenship. \nIn her June 25, 2007 sworn statement, Applicant also provided details of being\nstopped in March 1988 for transporting her mother\u2019s neighbor in a car across the\nborder. As she and her husband were leaving her mother\u2019s residence in Mexico, her\nmother asked Applicant to bring a neighbor back to the U.S. At the border crossing, the\nborder patrol asked for the passports of the occupants of Applicant\u2019s car. Applicant and\nher husband displayed their green cards, and the neighbor presented her passport for\ninspection. When the neighbor\u2019s passport was checked, it turned out to be Applicant\u2019s\npassport that Applicant lost in 1972. Applicant became perturbed as she wondered how\nher passport wound in the neighbor\u2019s possession. Applicant was charged with alien\nsmuggling. (SOR 1.d.) Her criminal record (Item 6) indicates no disposition. From the\ninformation provided in the FORM, including Applicant\u2019s statement, it is impossible for\nme to find how providing transportation constitutes evidence of preference under the\nforeign preference guideline. SOR 1.d. is found in Applicant\u2019s favor. \nForeign Influence (FI)\nApplicant was born in Mexico on December 3, 1952. Applicant\u2019s mother, 72\nyears old, is a retired, resident citizen of Mexico (SOR 2.a.) Applicant visits her mother\n\n3\ntwo or three times a week (SOR 2.b.) Applicant\u2019s 55-year-old brother, a truck driver, is a\nresident citizen of Mexico (SOR 2.c.), and she visits him about two or three times a\nmonth (SOR 2.d.) Applicant\u2019s sister, not referenced in the SOR, is a 42-year-old\nresident citizen of Mexico and unemployed. (Item 4) Applicant\u2019s niece is employed in\noffice and building maintenance. Applicant\u2019s sister-in-law and niece are resident citizens\nof Mexico. (SOR 2.e., Item 5)\nApplicant has two children who were born in the U.S. Her son is single and\nemployed as a sheriff in the U.S. Her daughter is married and employed as a translator.\nHer three sisters, nieces, and nephews live in the U.S. No additional information was\nprovided. \nCharacter Evidence\nApplicant did not provide any evidence to dispute, explain, or mitigate the\nallegations of the SOR. She provided no evidence that addresses her job performance.\nAdministrative Notice\nI have taken official notice of the following U.S. government agency publications:\n1. U.S. Department of State Background Note: Mexico, dated February 2007.\n(Exhibit 7)\n2. U.S. Department of State, Consular Affairs, Travel Warning: Mexico, dated\nOctober 24, 2007. (Exhibit 8)\nThe noticed documents indicate that after becoming a republic in 1824, Mexico\nimplemented its first constitution in 1917, providing for three branches of government,\nthe executive, legislative and judicial. In the last decade, the Mexican Congress has\nbecome a more important component of the Mexican government through increased\nrepresentation of opposition political groups in the legislative chamber. Mexico has been\nand continues to be a strong ally of the U.S. Their close relationship has resulted in\nmany important agreements, accords, and partnerships in commercial, cultural,\neducational areas, as well as security objectives such as the war on terrorism, and\ndecreasing the flow of drugs into the U.S. However, the October 2007 travel warning\nalerts U.S. travelers to be vigilant due the presence of criminal activity in many parts of\nthe country. Though there is no indication that U.S. citizens have been targeted, a large\nnumber of kidnappings (some still unresolved) of U.S. citizens have occurred in recent\nyears. \nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\n\n4\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are flexible rules of law that are applied in conjunction with the\ngeneral policy factors of the whole person concept. The Administrative Judge must\nconsider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable\nand unfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national interest is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2b.\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship is not restricted to normal duty hours. Rather, the relationship is an-around-\nthe-clock responsibility. The Government places a high degree of trust and confidence\nin individuals to whom it grants access to classified information. Decisions include\nconsideration of the possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to\nprotect or safeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of\nlegally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise\nof classified information.\nForeign Preference (FP)\nActing in a way that shows one\u2019s preference for a foreign country brings the\nindividual\u2019s conduct with the FP guideline.\nForeign Influence (FI) \nForeign contacts and financial interests may be a security concern when they\nhave the potential to be used to exert influence or pressure on an applicant in a way\nthat forces him into a position of having to choose between the foreign entity and the\nU.S. \n\n5\nAnalysis\nForeign Preference (FP)\nThe FP guideline is activated by actions taken by an individual that demonstrates\na preference for a foreign country over the U.S. Following her naturalization as a U.S.\ncitizen in December 2000, Applicant\u2019s statements and actions regarding her dual\ncitizenship activate FP disqualifying conditions (DC) 10a. (exercise of any right, privilege\nor obligation of foreign citizenship after becoming a U.S. citizen or through the foreign\ncitizenship of a family member). This includes but is not limited to: 5. (using foreign\ncitizenship to protect financial or business interests in another country); and, 7. (voting\nin foreign elections). Applicant declared her dual citizenship in her SCA in June 2005.\nShe voted in a Mexican city election in 2006, and plans to vote regularly in that election\nin the future to maintain her citizenship. Finally, Applicant maintains her dual citizenship\nbecause she may want to retire in Mexico in the future. \nWhile the FP guideline has six potentially mitigating conditions, none are\napplicable. FP MC 11.a. (dual citizenship is based solely on parents\u2019 citizenship or birth\nin a foreign country) does not apply because the statements and actions of Applicant\nover the last four years demonstrating a preference for Mexico. FP MC 11.b. (the\nindividual has expressed a willingness to renounce dual citizenship) is inapplicable\nbased on Applicant\u2019s behavior to preserve not renounce her Mexican citizenship. FP\nMC 11.c. (exercise of the rights, privileges, or obligations of foreign citizenship occurred\nbefore the individual became a U.S. citizen or when the individual was a minor) does\nnot apply due to Applicant\u2019s statements and actions of preference that occurred after\nshe obtained her U.S. citizenship in December 2000. The remaining three MC are\nirrelevant to the facts of this case. The FP guideline is found against Applicant. \nForeign Influence (FI)\nForeign contacts and interests result in security concerns where those contacts\nand interests create divided loyalties, or may be manipulated or induced by a foreign\nentity that is harmful to U.S., or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by any foreign\nentity. Decisions under this guideline should include the foreign country where the\ncontact or financial interest is located, including, but not limited to whether the foreign\ngovernment targets U.S. citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated\nwith the risk of terrorism. \nThe mere possession of family ties in a foreign country is not automatically\ndisqualifying under the foreign influence guideline. When assessing the family ties, it is\nimportant to weigh the totality of these ties in a foreign country, rather than trying to\nweigh them in isolation. ISCR Case No. 01-22693 at 7 (App. Bd. Sept. 22, 2003)\nConsidering the record as a whole, the government has established its case under the\nFI guideline. FI DC 7.a. (contact with a foreign family member, business or professional\nassociate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a foreign country if\nthat contact creates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation,\n\n6\npressure, or coercion) applies. Appellant visits her mother two or three times a week\nand her brother two or three times a month. \nThree of the six mitigating conditions under the FI guideline may apply to the\nfacts and circumstances of this case: \nFC MC 8.a. (the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the\ncountry in which these persons are located, or the position or activities of\nthose persons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will\nbe placed in a position of having to choose between the interests of a\nforeign individual, group, organization, or government and the interests of\nthe U.S.); \nFI MC 8.b. (there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s\nsense of loyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or\ncountry is minimal, or the individual has such deep and long lasting\nrelationships and loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected\nto resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest);\n FI MC 8.c. (contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual\nand infrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for\nforeign influence or exploitation).\nFI MC 8.a has limited application. Applicant\u2019s mother is retired and was never\nemployed nor an agent of the Mexican government. There is no evidence that\nApplicant\u2019s brother is an agent of the Mexican government. Applicant indicated her\nthree sisters and nieces live in the U.S., but she provided no other information about\ntheir citizenship or the current status of her sister-in-law, and her niece referred to in the\nSOR. SOR 2.d. is found against Applicant. While there is no indication that Mexico\ntargets U.S. citizens or is involved in terrorism, there is significant criminal activity in\nparts of the country. Applicant\u2019s frequent trips to see her family members in Mexico\nheighten the risk that pressure could be exerted on and through her family members to\nher. The limited application of FI MC 8.a. is insufficient to find in Applicant\u2019s favor under\nthe FI guideline. \nFI MC 8.b. is inapplicable as Applicant has not shown she can be expected to\nresolve any foreign conflict of interest in favor of U.S. interests. Her yearly voting in the\nMexican elections clearly compromises the loyalty she has for the U.S. FC MC 8.c. is\nunavailable for mitigation because Applicant\u2019s contact with her mother and brother is\nmore than casual and infrequent. Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns\nassociated with the FI guideline. \nWhole Person Concept (WPC)\nMy finding against Applicant under the FI and FP guidelines must still be\nevaluated in the context of nine variables known as the whole person concept. In\n\n7\nevaluating the relevance of an individual\u2019s conduct, the administrative judge should\nconsider the following factors: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2)\nthe circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3)\nthe frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the\ntime of the conduct; (5) the extent to which the participation was voluntary; (6) the\npresence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the\nmotivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. Based on the heightened\nrisk of foreign pressure being exerted through her family members to Applicant, and her\nstatements and actions demonstrating her desire to maintain Mexican citizenship, I am\nunable to find in Applicant\u2019s favor under the FP or FI guidelines. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1 (Foreign Preferences, Guideline C):\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d.\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2 (Foreign Influence, Guideline B):\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a. \nAgainst  Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.c.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.d.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.d.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.e.\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n                       \nPaul J. Mason\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Howry, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nAlan V. Edmunds, Esq.\n\n2\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On April 26, 2007, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of\nthe basis for that decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant\nrequested a hearing.  On October 31, 2007, after the hearing, Administrative Judge Darlene Lokey\nAnderson granted Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Department Counsel filed a timely\nappeal pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nDepartment Counsel raised the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge erred in her\napplication of the Financial Consideration Mitigating Conditions (FCMC); and whether the Judge\u2019s\nfavorable security clearance decision is arbitrary, capricious, and contrary to law.  Finding error, we\nreverse.  \nWhether the Record Supports the Judge\u2019s Factual Findings\nA.  Facts\nThe Judge made the following pertinent findings of fact: Applicant has a history of financial\ndifficulties, owing between $60,000 and $70,000 to twenty different creditors.  He has filed for\nbankruptcy three times, the first in 1995 under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code.  At that time his\ntotal liabilities amounted to $56,900.  He was discharged in bankruptcy later that year.  He filed\nagain for Chapter 13 bankruptcy in March 2006, but a judge subsequently dismissed it due to\nApplicant\u2019s having failed to comply with the trustee\u2019s payment plan.  Applicant filed a Chapter 13\npetition again in January 2007.  He began making payments under the plan in March 2007.  As of\nthe date of the decision, the plan will take three to five years to complete.\nThere are a number of incidents in Applicant\u2019s past which have a bearing upon his financial\ncondition.  He has lost two jobs, once being discharged Under Other Than Honorable Conditions\n(UOTHC) from the Air Force in lieu of court-martial.  The second, in 2004, was from a civilian\nemployer who fired Applicant for misuse of a company credit card.  He had used the card to pay for\nvisits to his mother, who was ill with cancer.  He was unemployed for four to five months following\nthis event.  He withdrew money from his retirement account in order to cover living expenses.  After\nsecuring new employment, Applicant again misused a company credit card, for which he was\ncounseled and warned that if he did it again he would be fired.   In addition to his lost jobs, in 1996\nhis employment contract expired, and he was forced to take a 25% pay cut and move to a new state,\nwhich also had an impact on his finances.\nIn addition to his employment difficulties, Applicant\u2019s daughter has had medical problems.\nIn 1994 she had cochlear implant surgery, which cost Applicant $2,000 out of pocket.  Batteries for\nthe implant cost Applicant about $50.00 a week.  In 2006 he incurred approximately $25,000.00 in\nlegal fees on behalf of his son, who had been arrested following a high school prank.  \nB.  Discussion\n\nDirective \u00b6 E2.18.\n1\n3\nThe Appeal Board\u2019s review of the Judge\u2019s findings of facts is limited to determining if they\nare supported by substantial evidence\u2013\u201csuch relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept\nas adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the record.\u201d  Directive\n\u00b6 E3.1.32.1.  \u201cThis is something less than the weight of the evidence, and the possibility of drawing\ntwo inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent an administrative agency\u2019s finding\nfrom being supported by substantial evidence.\u201d  Consolo v. Federal Maritime Comm\u2019n, 383 U.S.\n607, 620-21 (1966).  In evaluating the Judge\u2019s findings, we are required to give deference to the\nJudge\u2019s credibility determinations.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1. \nWhether the Record Supports the Judge\u2019s Ultimate Conclusions\n A Judge is required to \u201cexamine the relevant data and articulate a satisfactory explanation\nfor\u201d the decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the facts found and the choices made.\u2019\u201d\nMotor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n of the United States v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43\n(1983)(quoting Burlington Truck Lines, Inc. v. United States, 371 U.S. 156, 168 (1962)).  \u201cThe\ngeneral standard is that a clearance may be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests\nof the national security.\u2019\u201d  Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  The Appeal\nBoard may reverse the Judge\u2019s decision to grant, deny, or revoke a security clearance if it is arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.  Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.32.3 and E3.1.33.3.  \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility, there is a strong\npresumption against the grant or maintenance of a security clearance.  See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913\nF. 2d 1399, 1401 (9  Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991).  After the government presents\nth\nevidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the applicant to establish any appropriate\nmitigating conditions.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  \u201cThe application of disqualifying and mitigating\nconditions and whole person factors does not turn simply on a finding that one or more of them apply\nto the particular facts of a case.  Rather, their application requires the exercise of sound discretion\nin light of the record evidence as a whole.\u201d  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 05-03635 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec.\n20, 2006).\nThe security concern raised by Guideline F recognizes that \u201c[f]ailure or inability to live\nwithin one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack\nof judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information.\u201d   In\n1\nthe instant case the Judge properly concluded that the Government had presented substantial\nevidence of security significant unpaid debt.  Department Counsel\u2019s appeal challenges the Judge\u2019s\nconclusion that Applicant had met his burden of persuasion as to mitigation.\n\nDirective \u00b6 E2.23(b).   \u201c[T]he conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s\n2\ncontrol (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or\nseparation), and the individual acted responsibility under the circumstances . . .\u201d  \nApplicant was alleged to have secured  medical treatment at government expense on behalf of his ex-wife, who,\n3\nfollowing the divorce, would not have been entitled to it.  Government Exhibit (GE) 11 is a statement by Applicant on\nthis matter, in which he explains that he was honestly mistaken as to his marital status at the time in question, given the\nfact that he and his wife had each filed for divorce in different jurisdictions.  GE 12, however, is a statement by a fellow\nofficer to the effect that Applicant admitted that he knew his wife was not entitled to dependent benefits at the time she\nreceived them.  Applicant paid the government back for the cost of the services.  GE 11 at 3.     \nDirective \u00b6 E2.20(c).  \u201c[T]he person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are\n4\nclear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control . . .\u201d\nDirective \u00b6 E2.20(d).  \u201c[T]he individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise\n5\nresolve debts . . .\u201d  \nApplicant Exhibit (AE) N.\n6\n4\nDepartment Counsel disagrees, for example, with the Judge\u2019s conclusion that Applicant had\nestablished FIMC 23(b) .  The Judge pointed out that Applicant\u2019s debt problems were affected by\n2\nlost employment, family medical difficulties, and a divorce.  However, Department Counsel argues\nthat these misfortunes are not significant mitigating factors in Applicant\u2019s lengthy history of bad\ndebt.  Department Counsel\u2019s argument has merit.  The Board notes, for example, that Applicant\nresigned from the Air Force in lieu of court-martial, receiving a UOTHC, for allegedly obtaining\nservices to which he was not entitled.   Furthermore, his having been fired for misusing a company\n3\ncredit card resulted in several months of unemployment.  While these incidents may have had some\nbearing on his poor financial condition, it cannot be said that twice having been terminated for cause\nis a matter beyond Applicant\u2019s control.  By the same token, while Applicant incurred medical\nexpenditures on behalf of his daughter, the evidence does not support the conclusion that these debts\nwere ever a major portion of Applicant\u2019s difficulties, and in any event there is no reason to believe\nthat the $2,000.00 he spent on her surgery affects his current financial condition, as this expenditure\npredates his 1995 Chapter 7 bankruptcy discharge.  In addition, his divorce occurred in 1989, and\nthe evidence supplied by Applicant does not demonstrate that it continues to play a meaningful role\nin his ongoing financial worries.  To the extent that Applicant has faced difficulties beyond his\ncontrol, the record does not support the conclusion that they are quantitatively different from what\nan average person might expect to encounter during the course of a lifetime.  As it is, evidence\nsupplied by Applicant does not demonstrate that he has acted responsibly in addressing his financial\nproblems.     \nNeither are the other mitigating conditions which the Judge favorably applied\u2013the receipt of\ncounseling  and good-faith efforts to replay creditors \u2013supported by the weight of the record\n4\n5\nevidence.  While Applicant did engage the services of a credit counselor, he did so in January 2007\nas a precondition to filing for bankruptcy.  The counseling certificate, which he submitted as part of\nhis court filing, states that no debt repayment plan was prepared during the course of this \u201cbriefing,\u201d\nsuggesting that it was pro-forma,  thereby reducing the weight to which the counseling is entitled.6\n\nAE H at 4.  \n7\n5\nThat he apparently received similar counseling prior to his 2006 bankruptcy petition,  which was\n7\nsubsequently dismissed due to non-payment, is significant record evidence contrary to the Judge\u2019s\nconclusion under FCMC 20(c) that Applicant has demonstrated \u201cclear indications that the problem\nis being resolved or is under control.\u201d  Furthermore, Applicant\u2019s lengthy history of financial\nproblems, going back to the repossession of his car in 1986, makes it difficult to conclude that his\nhaving made payments under his most recent bankruptcy proceeding demonstrates good faith\nsufficient to mitigate the security concerns established by the Government\u2019s evidence.  Given\nApplicant\u2019s financial history, as reflected in the record evidence, his having made six months of\npayments on a second Chapter 13 plan, expected to extend years into the future, is not sufficient to\nsupport the Judge\u2019s conclusion under FMCM 20(d). \nDepartment Counsel argues that the Judge subjected Applicant\u2019s case to a piecemeal analysis.\nThe Board finds this argument persuasive.  While any one factor, such as divorce or illness,\nconsidered in isolation, might put Applicant\u2019s credit history in a sympathetic light, a Judge must\nevaluate the various aspects of an applicant\u2019s case in light of the totality of the record evidence.  See\nU.S. v. Bottone, 365 F. 2d 389, 392 (2d Cir. 1966), cert. denied 385 U.S. 974 (1966) (\u201cThe trier is\nentitled, in fact bound, to consider the evidence as a whole; and, in law as in life, the effect of this\ngenerally is much greater than the sum of the parts.\u201d)  In this case the Judge\u2019s decision runs counter\nto the weight of the record evidence.  See ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Jun. 2, 2006).\nThe  record, viewed  as a whole, does not support a conclusion that Applicant has met his burden\nof persuasion that it is \u201cclearly consistent with the interests of national security\u201d for him to have a\nclearance.

He has made a good faith effort to resolve his indebtedness and has shown that he\nis now financially responsible.  Clearance is granted.\n\n2\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn April 26, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to\nExecutive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2,\n1992, (as amended) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant, which detailed reasons\nwhy DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant and\nrecommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether clearance should be denied\nor revoked.\nThe Applicant responded to the SOR in writing on May 19, 2007, and requested a hearing\nbefore DOHA Administrative Judge.  This case was assigned to the undersigned on July 11, 2007.\nA notice of hearing was issued on August 15, 2007, scheduling the hearing for September 26, 2007.\nAt the hearing the Government presented fourteen exhibits.

Following this, the Applicant was unemployed for a time which caused\nfinancial difficulties.  \nIn 1990, the Applicant was still trying to financially recover from his previous divorce.  His\nex-wife had spent money without considering the consequences, and purchased things they really\n\n3\ncould not afford and did not need.  She did not pay their bills on time; and as a result, the Applicant\nwas deeply indebted.  Following the divorce, the Applicant absorbed all of the debt from the\nmarriage and the divorce expenses.\n By 1992, the Applicant had recovered from the debt he incurred during his first marriage.\nIn February 1988, the Applicant remarried and they had a daughter. By 1994, the Applicant had\ndetermined that there was something wrong with his daughter.  The Applicant explained that his\ndaughter\u2019s medical bills caused him to fall behind on his other bills and he was forced to resort to\nbankruptcy.  He explained that when his daughter was fourteen months old, she was over-medicated\nby her pediatrician.  This caused severe and permanent nerve damage to her ear and she lost her\nhearing.  (Tr. p. 54).   It was determined that she needed surgery that would entail a cochlear implant.\nHis daughter had the surgery which cost the Applicant $2,000.00 out of pocket.  The Applicant also\nexplained that in order to maintain the implant, batteries cost about $50.00 a week that must be\nprovided on a daily basis for the implant to work. The implant must to be replaced every two to three\nyears. It was also about this time, between 2003/2004, the Applicant  learned that his mother had\ncancer and he did everything he could to help her and spend time with her before she died.  Already\nin financial straits, he accumulated more debt.   \nOn June 23, 1995, the Applicant filed for bankruptcy under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy\nCode.  He listed assets of $5,765.00 and total liabilities of $56,909.00.  On October 13, 1995, the\nApplicant\u2019s debts were discharged.  (See Government Exhibits 9 and 10).\nFollowing his Chapter 7 bankruptcy, the Applicant was debt free.  In 1996, the Applicant\u2019s\nemployment contract expired and his employer gave him the option of being laid off or taking a 25%\npay reduction and move to Florida.  The Applicant took the pay reduction and move.  It was also\nabout this time that he and his wife had two more children and their living expenses increased.  Just\nafter moving to Florida and purchasing a house, the Applicant was offered a permanent job in\nCalifornia.  He moved back to California with his family and took the job.  The house in Florida sat\nvacant for three months before he could sell it, but he continued to pay the mortgage on it while still\npaying his living expenses in California.  This caused additional financial difficulties. \nOn March 30, 2006, the Applicant filed for bankruptcy protection under Chapter 13 of the\nBankruptcy Code.  At that time he listed total liabilities of $293,148.00 and total assets of\n$37,533.00.  On November 6, 2006, the Chapter 13 was dismissed for failing to comply with the\ntrustee\u2019s payment plan.  The Applicant explained that his son in high school pulled a prank at school\nand was arrested.  To get him out of juvenile hall, the Applicant paid the costs of bail and legal fees\nto represent his son.  In total these expenses cost the Applicant as much as $25,000.00.  (See\nApplicant\u2019s Exhibit H and Tr. p. 59).    \nThe Applicant admits each of the allegations in the SOR that includes indebtedness to twenty\ndifferent creditors for a total of between $60,000 and 70,000.  (See Government Exhibits 3, 4 and\n5, Applicant\u2019s Answer to SOR, and Tr. p. 71). \nThe Applicant re-filed on January 12, 2007, for bankruptcy protection under Chapter 13 of\n\n4\nthe Bankruptcy Code.  The Applicant testified and the documentation substantiates that the Chapter\n13 bankruptcy plan includes each of the creditors listed in the SOR.  (See Applicant\u2019s Exhibit O and\nTr. p. 45).  He plans to resolve each of these debts through the Chapter 13.  The plan requires that\nhe pay $1,700.00 a month to the bankruptcy trustee to be distributed to his creditors.  These funds\nare automatically deducted out of his payroll check.  Presently, the Applicant has paid approximately\n$6,100.00 towards the plan since he started it in March 2007.  He plans to continue with the program\nuntil his debts are paid in full.  The plan schedule indicates that it will take three to five years to pay\nall of the Applicant\u2019s debts, with 100 percent being paid to unsecured creditors.  (See Applicant\u2019s\nAnswer to SOR and attachments that include Chapter 13 Petition, Schedules and Plan).\nOn January 17, 2007, the Applicant received Consumer Credit Counseling as required by law\nwhen filing Chapter 13 Bankruptcy.  (See Applicant\u2019s Exhibit N) \n  \nIn June 2004, the Applicant was employed by another defense contractor.  From 2003\nthrough 2004, he misused the corporate credit card by using it for personal expenses.  To afford to\ntravel to visit his mother while she was ill, the Applicant used his corporate credit card for airplane\ntickets, gas and other related expenses.  He is indebted in the amount of $6,000.00.  He was\nterminated by this defense contractor for this misconduct.\nThe Applicant was unemployed for four to five months before he got another job with a\ndefense contractor.  During this period, his wife was also unemployed and he withdrew money from\nhis retirement account to help cover their living expenses.  He was so desperate for money and the\ndesire to spend time with his mother that he again started using his corporate credit card for personal\nexpenses.  In 2005, the Applicant was counseled by his employer for using his corporate credit card\nfor personal expenses; and told that if he were ever to do it again, he would be terminated from\nemployment.\nNumerous letters of recommendation from the Applicant\u2019s superiors, coworkers and friends\nsome of who know the Applicant during his time at the Air Force Academy attest to the Applicant\u2019s\nsense of integrity, honesty, reliability, loyalty to the United States, positive attitude, and maturity.\nThey say that his character is simply beyond reproach.  He is considered to be a hard worker and\nteam player with a strong commitment to the Department of Defense.  He is said to be an in valuable\nasset to the program and an outstanding individual in every way.  The Applicant is highly\nrecommended for a position of trust.  (See Applicant\u2019s Exhibits A, B, C, D, E, F, J and K).  \nThe Applicant currently earns $110,000 annually and his income comfortably covers his bills\nand expenses.\nPOLICIES\nEnclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudication policies divided into \"Disqualifying\nFactors\" and \"Mitigating Factors.\"  The following Disqualifying Factors and Mitigating Factors are\nfound to be applicable in this case:\n\n5\nGuideline F (Financial Considerations)\n18.  The Concern.  Failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial\nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and\nregulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and\nability to protect classified information.  An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of\nhaving to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nConditions that could raise a security concern:\n19(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; \n19(c) a history of not meeting financial obligation; \n19(e) consistent spending beyond one\u2019s means, which may be indicated by excessive\nindebtedness, significant negative cash flow, high debt-to-income ration, and/or other financial\nanalysis. \nConditions that could mitigate security concerns:\n20(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s\ncontrol (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death,\ndivorce or separation), and the individual has acted responsibly under the circumstances;\n20(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear\nindications that the problem is being resolved or is under control;\n20(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise\nresolve debts.\n \nIn addition, as set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive at pages 16-17,  in evaluating the\nrelevance of an individual\u2019s conduct, the Administrative Judge should consider the following general\nfactors:\n a.  The nature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding circumstances\nb.  The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation\nc.  The frequency and recency of the conduct\nd.  The individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct\ne.  The voluntariness of participation\n\n6\nf.  The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavior changes\ng.  The motivation for the conduct \nh. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress\n \ni.  The likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nThe eligibility criteria established in the DoD Directive identify personal characteristics and\nconduct which are reasonably related to the ultimate question, posed in Section 2 of Executive Order\n10865, of whether it is \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d to grant an Applicant\u2019s request\nfor access to classified information.\nThe DoD Directive states, \u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period\nof a person\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the person is an acceptable security risk.\nEligibility for access to classified information is predicted upon the individual meeting these\npersonnel security guidelines.  The adjudicative process is the careful weighing of a number of\nvariables known as the whole person concept.  Available, reliable information about the person, past\nand present, favorable and unfavorable should be considered in reaching a determination.\u201d The\nAdministrative Judge can draw only those inferences or conclusions that have reasonable and logical\nbasis in the evidence of record.  The Judge cannot draw inferences or conclusions based on evidence\nwhich is speculative or conjectural in nature.  Finally, as emphasized by President Eisenhower in\nExecutive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under this order . . . shall be a determination in terms\nof the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the Applicant\nconcerned.\u201d\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn the defense industry, the security of classified industrial secrets is entrusted to civilian\nworkers who must be counted upon to safeguard such sensitive information twenty-four hours per\nday, seven days per week.  The Government is therefore appropriately concerned when available\ninformation indicates that an Applicant for clearance may be involved in instances of financial\nirresponsibility which demonstrates poor judgment or unreliability.\nIt is the Government\u2019s responsibility to present substantial evidence to support the finding\nof a nexus, or rational connection, between the Applicant\u2019s conduct and the holding of a security\nclearance.  If such a case has been established, the burden then shifts to the Applicant to go forward\nwith evidence in rebuttal, explanation or mitigation which is sufficient to overcome or outweigh the\nGovernment\u2019s case.  The Applicant bears the ultimate burden of persuasion in proving that it is\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant his a security clearance.\nIn this case the Government has met its initial burden of proving that the Applicant has been\n\n7\nfinancially irresponsible (Guideline F).  This evidence indicates poor judgment, unreliability and\nuntrustworthiness on the part of the Applicant.  Because of the scope and nature of the Applicant's\nconduct, I conclude there is a nexus or connection with his security clearance eligibility.\nConsidering all of the evidence, the Applicant has introduced persuasive evidence in rebuttal,\nexplanation or mitigation that is sufficient to overcome the Government's case.  With respect to his\nfinances, the Applicant poor financial history was partially caused by episodes of poor judgment and\npoor financial management as well as circumstances beyond his control, namely his daughter\u2019s\nmedical condition, his son\u2019s unexpected legal fees, his mother\u2019s death, and his job transfer and pay\nreduction.  In regard to the debts listed in the SOR, each of them has now been included in a payment\nplan under Chapter 13 of the Bankruptcy Code.  The Applicant has been making payments toward\nthese debts for about six months and will continue to follow the requirements of the payment plan\nfor the next three to five years or until he is debt free.  He has also received credit counseling that\nwill assist him in maintaining his budget.  Under the circumstances, he has made a good faith effort\nto resolve his indebtedness, and there is evidence of financial rehabilitation.  The Applicant has\ndemonstrated that he can properly handle his financial affairs.  \nIn the event that the Applicant does not continue to follow the trustee\u2019s plan under the\nChapter 13 and pay off his debts accordingly, his security clearance will once again be in immediate\njeopardy.  Furthermore, the Applicant understands the policy prohibiting the use of corporate or\ngovernment credit cards for personal use.  He will never ever use his corporate credit card for\npersonal expenses under any circumstances, unless it is specifically authorized.  Under Guideline\nF (Financial Considerations), Disqualifying Conditions 19(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy\ndebts; 19(c) a history of not meeting financial obligation; 19(e) consistent spending beyond one\u2019s\nmeans, which may be indicated by excessive indebtedness, significant negative cash flow, high debt-\nto-income ration, and/or other financial analysis apply.  Mitigating Conditions 20(b) the conditions\nthat resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of\nemployment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or\nseparation), and the individual has acted responsibly under the circumstances, 20(c) the person has\nreceived or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear indications that the\nproblem is being resolved or is under control and 20(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort\nto repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts also apply.  Accordingly, I find for the\nApplicant under Guideline F (Financial Considerations).  \nOn balance, it is concluded that the Applicant has overcome the Government's case opposing\nhis request for a  security clearance.  Accordingly, the evidence supports a finding for the Applicant\nas to the factual and conclusionary allegations expressed in Paragraph 1 for the  Government's\nStatement of Reasons.  \nFORMAL FINDINGS\n\n8\nFormal findings For or Against the Applicant on the allegations in the SOR, as required by\nParagraph 25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive are:\nParagraph 1 For the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.a.:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.b:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.c:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.d:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.e:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.f:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.g:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.h:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.i:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.j:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.k:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.l:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.m:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.n:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.o:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.p:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.q:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.r:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.s:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.t:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.u:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.v:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.w:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.x:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.y:\nFor the Applicant.\n   \nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant.\n  Darlene Lokey Anderson\n\n9\nAdministrative Judge\n",

LEONARD\nAPPEARANCES\nFOR GOVERNMENT\nRobert E. Coacher, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nSYNOPSIS\nApplicant has a history of financial problems. She did not present sufficient evidence to\nrebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the financial considerations security concern. Eligibility for a\nsecurity clearance is denied.\n\n Executive Order 10865, dated February 20, 1960, as amended, and DoD Directive 5220.6, dated January 2,\n1\n1992, as amended (Directive).\n See Memorandum from the Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence, dated August 30, 2006, Subject:\n2\nImplementation of Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information (December\n29, 2005). \n2\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nApplicant contests the Defense Department\u2019s intent to deny or revoke her eligibility for a\nsecurity clearance. Acting under the relevant Executive Order and DoD Directive,  dated January 2,\n1\n1992, as amended (Directive), DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) to Applicant on February\n22, 2007. The SOR\u2014which is equivalent to an administrative complaint\u2014details the factual basis\nfor the action and alleges a security concern under Guideline F for financial considerations based on\nmultiple delinquent  debts, to include student loans, and under Guideline E for personal conduct\nbased on falsification of Question 39 on the security-clearance application.\nIn addition to the Directive, this case is brought under the revised Adjudicative Guidelines\nfor Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information (Revised Guidelines) approved by\nthe President on December 29, 2005. The Revised Guidelines were then modified by the Defense\nDepartment, effective September 1, 2006. They supersede or replace the guidelines published in\nEnclosure 2 to the Directive and Appendix 8 to DoD Regulation 5200.2-R. They apply to all\nadjudications and other determinations where an SOR has been issued on September 1, 2006, or\nthereafter.  Both the Directive and the Regulation are pending formal amendment. The Revised\n2\nGuidelines apply to this case because the SOR is dated February 22, 2007, which is after the\neffective date.  \nApplicant timely replied to the SOR in writing on March 14, 2007, and on April 27, 2007.\nShe elected to have her case decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. In her written reply\nto the SOR, she admitted all indebtedness alleged under Guideline F. Also, she provided a two-page\nhandwritten explanation of her financial situation. She did not respond to the falsification allegation\nunder Guideline E, and her lack of response is construed as a denial.   \nOn May 8, 2007, the government submitted its written case consisting of all relevant and\nmaterial information that could be adduced at a hearing. This so-called file of relevant material\n(FORM) was mailed to Applicant and it was received by her May 21, 2007. Her reply to the FORM\nis a one-page handwritten letter, which was received within the 30-day period. It was reviewed by\ndepartment counsel who voiced no objections, and it is admitted into the record as Exhibit A. The\ncase was assigned to me on June 25, 2007.   \n\n3\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant\u2019s admissions to the SOR allegations under Guideline F are incorporated herein as\nfindings of fact. Based on the record evidence as a whole, I find the following facts:\n1.\nApplicant is a 24-year-old employee of a company engaged in federal contracting. She earned\nan associate\u2019s degree from a technical institute in June 2004. One month later, she started her current\njob working as an associate designer. \n2.\nApplicant completed a security-clearance application in July 2004. A security-clearance\napplication requires an individual to disclose information about their background, to include their\nfinancial record. In response to Question 38 about financial delinquencies, Applicant answered the\nquestion \u201cyes,\u201d and she reported that she had, in the last seven years, been more than 180 days\ndelinquent on a debt. She then listed a $1,263 credit card account. In response to Question 39 about\nfinancial delinquencies, Applicant answered the question \u201cyes,\u201d and she reported that she was\ncurrently more than 90 days delinquent on a debt. She then listed a $1,201 hospital bill and noted\nthat it was involved in a legal dispute. When signing the application, Applicant certified that her\nstatements were true, complete, and correct to the best of her knowledge and belief, and were made\nin good faith. Also, she acknowledged that a knowing and willful false statement could be punished\nunder federal law. \n3.\nApplicant has a history of financial problems, as evidenced by derogatory information in\ncredit reports from 2005 and 2007. For example, the public record section of the 2005 report\nrevealed a $705 civil judgment filed in January 2003. The report also reveals past-due accounts, bad\ndebts, and eight accounts in the collections section of the report. The 2007 credit report further\nrevealed or confirmed Applicant\u2019s unfavorable financial history.  \n4.\nThe SOR alleges that Applicant has 17 delinquent debts for about $10,796. Based on the\nrecord evidence as a whole, I find that the 17 delinquent debts are established by substantial\nevidence. In particular, Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts are established by the 2005 and 2007  credit\nreports and her admissions. Her indebtedness includes a number of unpaid medical accounts and\nseveral past-due student loans. \n5.\nIn her written responses to the SOR and the FORM, Applicant attempted to explain the\ncircumstances surrounding her financial problems. She said that her student loans were placed into\nforbearance for one year as of March 14, 2007, but she did not present any documentary evidence\nverifying her statement. She attributed the multiple unpaid medical bills to a series of health\nproblems followed by periods where she was could not work. She explained that she is doing what\nshe can to pay her delinquent debts, but has limited means to do so after paying regular living\nexpenses. Other than her written responses to the SOR and the FORM, Applicant did not present\nproof of payment or other documentary evidence about the debts in question, nor did she present\ndocumentary evidence about  her overall financial situation. \nPOLICIES\n\n Executive Order 10865, \u00a7 7.\n3\n ISCR Case No. 96-0277 (App. Bd. Jul. 11, 1997).\n4\n ISCR Case No. 02-18663 (App. Bd. Mar. 23, 2004).\n5\n Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.14.\n6\n Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n7\n Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n8\n Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988) (\u201cit should be obvious that no one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a\n9\nsecurity clearance\u201d); Duane v. Department of Defense, 275 F.3d 988, 994 (10  Cir. 2002) (\u201cIt is likewise plain that there\nth\nis no \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance, so that full-scale due process standards do not apply to cases such as Duane\u2019s.\u201d).\n Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.\n10\n4\nThe Revised Guidelines sets forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when evaluating a\nperson\u2019s security clearance eligibility, including disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating\nconditions (MC) for each guideline. In addition, each clearance decision must be a fair and impartial\ncommonsense decision based upon consideration of all the relevant and material information, the\npertinent criteria and adjudication factors, and the whole-person concept. A person granted access\nto classified information enters into a special relationship with the government. The government\nmust be able to have a high degree of trust and confidence in those persons to whom it grants access\nto classified information. The decision to deny a person a security clearance is not a determination\nof an applicant\u2019s loyalty.  Instead, it is a determination that the applicant has not met the strict\n3\nguidelines the President has established for granting eligibility for a security clearance.\nBURDEN OF PROOF\nThe only purpose of a security-clearance decision is to decide if it is clearly consistent with\nthe national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for an applicant.  There is no\n4\npresumption in favor of granting or continuing access to classified information.  The government\n5\nhas the burden of presenting evidence to establish facts alleged in the SOR that have been\ncontroverted.  An applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or\n6\nmitigate facts that have been admitted or proven.  In addition, an applicant has the ultimate burden\n7\nof persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.8\nNo one has a right to a security clearance.  As noted by the Supreme Court in Department\n9\nof Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe clearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations\nshould err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d  Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the\n10\nDirective, any doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified information\nwill be resolved in favor of protecting national security.\nCONCLUSIONS\n\n Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.2. \n11\n Examples of other large bureaucratic institutions that rely heavily on documentation include banks, insurance\n12\ncompanies, hospitals, universities, and the Armed Forces. \n5\nPersonal conduct under Guideline E addresses issues of questionable judgment,\nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules\nand regulations. In this regard, the deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of a material\nfact in any written document or oral statement to the government when applying for a security\nclearance or in other official matters is a security concern. It is deliberate if it is done knowingly and\nwillfully. An omission of relevant and material information is not deliberate if the person genuinely\nforgot about it, inadvertently overlooked it, misunderstood the question, or genuinely thought the\ninformation did not need to be reported.\nAt issue here is the truthfulness of Applicant\u2019s answer to Question 39 of her security-\nclearance application. Although her answer was incomplete and did not reveal the full extent of her\nfinancial delinquencies, the record evidence is insufficient to prove that she intentionally withheld\nor concealed her financial delinquencies. There is no evidence that Applicant was confronted and\ninterviewed about this issue during a background investigation, and a written statement was\napparently not obtained from Applicant. Likewise, there is no evidence that the agency confronted\nher via written interrogatories or by an interview as allowed under the Directive.  Given the skimpy\n11\nrecord here, I cannot conclude that Applicant gave a deliberately false answer to Question 39.\nAccordingly, Guideline E is decided for Applicant.  \nUnder Guideline F for financial considerations, a concern typically exists due to significant\nunpaid debts. Failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial\nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and\nregulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and\nability to protect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of\nhaving to engage in illegal or unethical acts to generate funds to meet financial obligations.\nSimilarly, an individual who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, unconcerned,\nnegligent, or careless in properly handling and safeguarding classified information.   \nHere, based on the record evidence as a whole, a security concern is raised by significant\nunpaid debts. Applicant has a well-established history of financial problems. Her derogatory\nfinancial history is a security concern because it indicates inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts\nand a history of not meeting financial obligations within the meaning of Guideline F.\nI reviewed the MC under the guideline and conclude none apply. She did not present\nsufficient evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the financial considerations concern. In\nparticular, the record evidence is insufficient to establish that she has made a good-faith effort to pay\nor otherwise resolve her indebtedness. Given the lack of documentation, I cannot accept her claim\nthat her student loans are in forbearance. Likewise, her failure to provide reliable, documentary\nevidence about her medical problems, the resulting unemployment, and her finances weakens her\nclaims and explanations. Large bureaucratic institutions\u2014like the Defense Department and the\nsecurity-clearance programs it administers\u2014do not run on word-of-mouth.  They run on\n12\ndocumentation. The documentation can be stored electronically or on paper, but it is up to Applicant\n\n Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.15. \n13\n6\nto produce reliable evidence, to include documentary evidence, to rebut, explain, extenuate, or\nmitigate the facts admitted by her and proven by the credit reports.  Although Applicant is not\n13\nlegally required to produce documentary evidence to prevail, the lack of documentation in a financial\ncase makes it difficult to reach a favorable decision under the clearly-consistent standard. \nAt this point, Applicant\u2019s history of financial problems\u2014including past-due student\nloans\u2014militates against granting her eligibility for a security clearance. Applicant did not met her\nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision. In reaching this conclusion,\nI also considered Applicant\u2019s case under the whole-person concept and my whole-person analysis\ndoes not support a favorable outcome for Applicant.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nHere are my conclusions for each allegation in the SOR:\nSOR \u00b6 1\u2013Guideline F:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraphs a\u2013q:\nAgainst Applicant\nSOR \u00b6 2\u2013Guideline E:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph a:\nFor Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all the facts and circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the national interest\nto grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.

None of these documents bears Applicant\u2019s signature.\n2\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On August 31,  2007, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of\nthe basis for that decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant\nrequested a hearing.  On February 21, 2008, after the hearing, Administrative Judge Charles D.\nAblard granted Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Department Counsel filed a timely\nappeal pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nDepartment Counsel raised the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge erred in his\napplication of the Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions (FCMC); whether he substituted\na favorable credibility determination for record evidence; and whether the Judge\u2019s conclusion as to\none of the allegations in the SOR is inconsistent with the record evidence.  Finding error, we reverse\nthe decision of the Judge.\nWhether the Record Supports the Judge\u2019s Factual Findings\nA.  Facts\nThe Judge made the following pertinent findings of fact: Applicant is an employee of a\ndefense contractor.  He holds a B.S. in electrical engineering from a well-known university.\nApplicant has two delinquent debts, both of which arose from his interactions with a member of his\nfamily, an uncle.  The first of the two concerns two houses which Applicant had purchased, along\nwith his uncle, in order to generate rental income.  Applicant had given his uncle a power of attorney\nfor him to arrange for the purchase.  However, the uncle did not make payments, and one of the\nhouses was sold at a foreclosure sale.  Applicant owes a $95,000 deficiency resulting from this sale.\nAdditionally, Applicant\u2019s uncle filed for bankruptcy protection three times in 2002 and 2003, in\nApplicant\u2019s name.  Applicant has requested dismissal of these bankruptcies.  Applicant claims that\nthe house that was subject to the foreclosure sale was seriously overvalued at the time he purchased\nit.  He claims that it was merely a shell of a house, having been damaged by the elements and by fire.\nHe has sought a new appraisal of the house.  He submitted some documents after the hearing,\naddressed to local, state, and federal officials advising them that he believes that he was a victim of\nfraud.  Applicant also attempted to hire an attorney to represent him \u201cbut the attorney declined to\ntake the case because of the distance from his office to the courts where the action occurred.\nApplicant has since attempted to resolve the matter himself.  He filed a fraud and identity theft\ncomplaint against his uncle.\u201d   Decision at 3 (citations omitted).  The second delinquent debt\n1\nconcerns a repossessed car, purchased in Applicant\u2019s name by the same uncle.  This debt had been\nremoved from Applicant\u2019s credit report \u201cbecause the creditor has agreed that it was obtained through\nidentify theft.\u201d  Id.    \n\n3\nApplicant lives with a woman and their two children.  Applicant and his partner have a joint\nincome of over $5,000 a month, with over $1,000 left over after expenses.  \n   B.  Discussion\nThe Appeal Board\u2019s review of the Judge\u2019s findings of facts is limited to determining if they\nare supported by substantial evidence\u2013\u201csuch relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept\n as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the same record.\u201d\nDirective  \u00b6 E3.1.32.1.  \u201cThis is something less than the weight of the evidence, and the possibility\nof drawing two inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent an administrative\nagency\u2019s finding from being supported by substantial evidence.\u201d  Consolo v. Federal Maritime\nComm\u2019n, 383 U.S. 607, 620 (1966).  In evaluating the Judge\u2019s findings, we are required to give\ndeference to the Judge\u2019s credibility determinations.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1.\nDepartment Counsel contends that the Judge\u2019s decision is not supported by record evidence.\nThe Board will address this contention in the discussion below.  \nWhether the Record Supports the Judge\u2019s Ultimate Conclusions\n A Judge is required to \u201cexamine the relevant data and articulate a satisfactory explanation\nfor\u201d the decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.\u2019\u201d\nMotor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n of the United States v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43\n(1983)(quoting Burlington Truck Lines, Inc. v. United States, 371 U.S. 156, 168 (1962)).  \u201cThe\ngeneral standard is that a clearance may be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests\nof the national security.\u2019\u201d  Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  The Appeal\nBoard may reverse the Judge\u2019s decision to grant, deny, or revoke a security clearance if it is arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.  Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.32.3 and E3.1.33.3.  \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility, there is a strong\npresumption against the grant or maintenance of a security clearance.  See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913\nF. 2d 1399, 1401 (9  Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991).  After the government presents\nth\nevidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the applicant to establish any appropriate\nmitigating conditions.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  \u201cThe application of disqualifying and mitigating\nconditions and whole person factors does not turn simply on a finding that one or more of them apply\nto the particular facts of a case.  Rather, their application requires the exercise of sound discretion\nin light of the record evidence as a whole.\u201d  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 05-03635 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec.\n20, 2006).\nIn deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are arbitrary or capricious, the Board\nwill review the Judge's decision to determine whether:  it does not examine relevant evidence; it fails\nto articulate a satisfactory explanation for its conclusions, including a rational connection between\nthe facts found and the choice made; it does not consider relevant factors; it reflects a clear error of\njudgment; it fails to consider an important aspect of the case; it offers an explanation for the decision\nthat runs contrary to the record evidence; or it is so implausible that it cannot be ascribed to a mere\n\nThe Judge identified four Financial Considerations Disqualifying Conditions (FCDC) \u201cthat might be\n2\napplicable\u201d in this case.  Directive \u00b6 E2.19(a): \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts;\u201d (b): \u201cindebtedness caused\nby frivolous or irresponsible spending and the absence of any evidence of willingness or intent to pay the debt or\nestablish a realistic plan to pay the debt;\u201d (c) \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations;\u201d and (d) \u201cdeceptive or illegal\nfinancial practices such as embezzlement, employee theft, check fraud, income tax evasion, expense account fraud, filing\ndeceptive loan statements, and other intentional financial breaches of trust.\u201d  Decision at 5.  \n4\ndifference of opinion.  In deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are contrary to law,\nthe Board will consider whether they are contrary to provisions of Executive Order 10865, the\nDirective, or other applicable federal law.  See ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Jun. 2,\n2006).\nThe Judge properly concluded that Applicant\u2019s case raised security concerns under Guideline\nF.   Department Counsel argued, however, that the Judge erred in his application of the pertinent\n2\nmitigating conditions.  The Judge identified three such conditions as applicable to this case.  The\nfirst, FCMC 20(a), mitigates security concerns when the debts are not recent; were infrequent or\nunlikely to recur; or they do not cast doubt upon Applicant\u2019s \u201ccurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or\ngood judgment.\u201d  Directive \u00b6 E2.20(a).  The second, FCMC 20(b), concerns debts that arose from\ncauses outside Applicant\u2019s control.  It requires that Applicant has \u201cacted responsibly under the\ncircumstances.\u201d  Directive \u00b6 E2.20(b).  The third is FMCM 20(e), which mitigates security concerns\nif the individual has \u201ca reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the . . . debt . . . and provides\ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions to resolve\nthe issue.\u201d  Directive \u00b6 E2.20(e).  The Judge stated that while the actions which Applicant has taken\n\u201cmay not have been as prompt as they might have been or as successful as he hoped,\u201d these actions\n\u201cwarrant the application of the above mitigating conditions in this matter.\u201d  Decision at 5.   \nDepartment Counsel argued that the Judge\u2019s decision is not supported by the record evidence\nand that, in ruling in favor of Applicant, the Judge, in effect, substituted his favorable credibility\ndetermination for record evidence.  The Board finds Department Counsel\u2019s argument persuasive.\nIn the first place, the Board notes the fact that, as of the close of the record, Applicant had not\nsatisfied the deficiency judgment resulting from the foreclosure sale.  The ongoing nature of this debt\nis inconsistent with a conclusion that the debt is not recent.  See ISCR Case No. 07-10575 at 3 (App.\nBd. Jul. 3, 2008), holding that an unsatisfied debt is a continuing course of conduct for the purpose\nof FCMC 20(a).  Furthermore, considering the evidence as a whole, there is insufficient basis to\nconclude that Applicant has acted responsibly in regard to this debt or that he has taken \u201caction to\nresolve\u201d it.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 07-05632 at 2 (App. Bd. May 13, 2008).  He submitted to the\nJudge some unsigned letters complaining of fraud, letters which were not actually mailed as of the\nclose of the record.  He consulted an attorney, who declined to take his case because the courthouse\nwas too far from the attorney\u2019s office.  There is no evidence that he attempted to hire another lawyer.\nNeither is there evidence of other behavior that can be characterized as responsible in view of\nApplicant\u2019s financial circumstances as he has presented them.  Government Exhibits 4 and 5,\nreferenced above, were apparently drafted two years after Applicant\u2019s discovery of the alleged\n\nSee Tr. at 23.  \u201c[Judge]: So you don\u2019t have any documents today that really relate to the [mortgage] issue?\n3\n[Applicant]: The pictures of the house and the appraisal. [Judge]: Well, if you want to offer those into evidence, that\ndoesn\u2019t carry us very far, but you can put it in for what it\u2019s worth.\u201d  \nApplicant claimed that his uncle had not used the power of attorney when he filed for bankruptcy, apparently\n4\nrepresenting himself as Applicant.  Tr. at 33.  There is no corroboration for this assertion.  Compare, for example, the\npurportedly forged signatures on the bankruptcy documents with Applicant\u2019s signature on the SF 86 submitted in this\ncase.  Government Exhibit 1, SF 86, dated October 20, 2005; Government Exhibit 13, Bankruptcy Documents.  \nSee Directive \u00b6 E2.18.  Delinquent debts \u201cmay indicate . . . lack of judgment . . .\u201d\n5\nApplicant testified that his car was repossessed in 2002 and that he discovered the mortgage problems in 2004.\n6\nTr. at 14-15; 40-44.\n5\nmortgage fraud.  As stated in Footnote 1 above, the record does not demonstrate the result of these\ncomplaints.  On its face, the record will not sustain a conclusion that Applicant has acted responsibly\nin regard to the deficiency judgment or that he has taken meaningful action to resolve it.  FCMC\n20(a), (e).          \nConcerning the alleged fraud, through which Applicant attempted to show that his debt arose\nfrom causes outside his control, there is a paucity of corroboration .  The evidence actually contained\nin the file, when read as a whole, supports a conclusion that Applicant made a bad business decision.\nHowever, although there is record evidence that the house in question was overvalued at the time\nof the loan, there is nothing beyond Applicant\u2019s own assertions to connect this fact with fraud\nperpetrated by the uncle on him.   Furthermore, Applicant\u2019s contention that the uncle filed for\n3\nbankruptcy protection three times in Applicant\u2019s name is not supported by the evidence.  The\nbankruptcy petitions appear to have been signed by Applicant himself, there being nothing on them\nto suggest that some other person was signing them by means of a power of attorney or through an\nact of misrepresentation.    Accordingly, under the facts of this case, Applicant\u2019s claim of having\n4\nbeen a victim of identity theft or some other form of fraud is insufficient to demonstrate that his\ndelinquent debt arose from causes outside his control.    \nHowever, even if one accepts Applicant\u2019s contention that his uncle defrauded him during the\ncourse of their real estate transaction, the episode as a whole impugns Applicant\u2019s judgment, which\nis at the heart of Guideline F.   The fact that he relied on his uncle to make the mortgage payments\n5\non the house, despite another instance in which the uncle allegedly failed to make car payments on\nbehalf of Applicant, resulting in repossession of the vehicle, suggests that Applicant lacks the\nreliability and trustworthiness necessary to justify the grant of a clearance.   The evidence viewed\n6\nas a whole does not sustain a conclusion that Applicant has mitigated the broad security concerns\nidentified by the Judge as arising from this case.  See Footnote 2 above.  Neither does it support the\nJudge\u2019s conclusion that Applicant has met his burden under a whole-person analysis.  The Board is\npersuaded by Department Counsel\u2019s argument that the Judge based his decision not on the weight\nof the record evidence but on a favorable impression of Applicant\u2019s demeanor, job performance, etc.\nIn light of this, the Board need not discuss Department Counsel\u2019s second assignment of error,\nalthough we note an apparent discrepancy between the Judge\u2019s finding that Applicant\u2019s uncle had\n\n6\nfraudulently purchased a car in Applicant\u2019s name and Applicant\u2019s own testimony describing the car\nas his own.  The decision does not explain this discrepancy or attempt to resolve it.  In light of the\nabove, Applicant has not met his burden of persuasion that it is \u201cclearly consistent with national\ninterest\u201d to grant him a clearance.

On August 31, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued\na Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under Guideline F for\nApplicant. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified\nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense\nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program\n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG)\npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the\nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on September 24, 2007, and requested a\nhearing before an Administrative Judge. Department Counsel was prepared to proceed\non October 22, 2007. I received the case assignment on October 31, 2007. DOHA\nissued a notice of hearing on November 7, 2007, and I convened the hearing as\nscheduled on November 26, 2007. The government offered 14 exhibits (Exh.) which\nwere received without objection.

Based upon a review of the\ncase file, pleadings, exhibits, testimony, and the applicable statutory provision relating\nto an applicant, eligibility for access to classified information is granted.\nProcedural and Evidentiary Rulings\nPost-hearing Submission\nApplicant was given 30 days from the date of the hearing or until December 31,\n2007, to submit additional material which he stated that he intended to obtain by\ntraveling to state where property that was the subject of the hearing was located. When\nhe did not submit anything on that date, the government contacted him and learned that\nhe believed the date was the end of January 2008. He was then given until January 25,\n2008 to make a submission. He did so on January 28, 2008. The government objects to\nthe documents based on the lateness of the submission. She also questions the value\nof the submissions as credible evidence. The documents were admitted. \nFindings of Fact\nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the factual allegations in the SOR\nof financial security concerns with explanations.\nApplicant is a 34-year-old employee of a major defense contractor working as a\ntest engineer for the past four years. He holds a B.S. degree in electrical engineering\nfrom a well known southwestern university. Since graduation in 1997 he worked five\nyears for another defense contractor before taking his present position. He has held a\nsecurity clearance since 2003. \nThis matter concerns Guideline F Financial issues involving two allegations. The\nfirst concerns a 2005 judgment for $95,512 arising from a bank mortgage on real estate\n(SOR 1.a.); the second concerns a 2002 repossession of an automobile (SOR 1.b.). He\nfirst became aware of his financial problems in December, 2004 when he was unable to\nbuy a home for himself and his family because of his bad credit rating based these two\ndelinquent debts (Tr. 17) which he reported on his SF 86. He advised his security office\nof these financial issues on September 28, 2005 (Exh. 2). \nThe debts of both allegations resulted from a real estate investment collaboration\nApplicant entered into in 2001 with his uncle to buy, renovate, and rent two houses to\nlow income tenants (Exh. 4).The houses purchased were in the home state of Applicant\nwhich is over a thousand miles from his state of residence. The properties were\npurchased in Applicant\u2019s name by the uncle using a power of attorney given to him by\nApplicant. Thus, he is legally responsible for the debt. The $95,000 judgment is based\non a foreclosure on one of the houses. A loan was made by the bank to the uncle based\non the appraised value of the house of $125,000 which was apparently vastly\noverstated (Exh. B).\n\n3\nPayments were not made on the loan and three bankruptcies were filed in 2002\nand 2003 in the Applicant\u2019s name by the uncle in an unsuccessful effort to preclude\nforeclosure of the property. Applicant has requested dismissal of the record of all of the\nbankruptcies from the trustee (Exh. 7). A full statement of the various dealings between\nApplicant and his uncle is in the record (Exhibit 4).\nAn inspection of the subject property was made in May 2006 and a report\nprovided which indicates that the house is basically a shell with significant damage from\nthe elements and fire (Exh. C). Pictures of the property were shown at the hearing and\ndescribed in the record (Tr. 24-26). This has now developed into a question of the\namount of the appraisal and whether it was obtained by fraud. Applicant has taken\naction to obtain a new appraisal and to revoke the actions of the bank that foreclosed.\nThe post-hearing submission contains drafts of letters to local, state and federal officials\nthat he intends to submit as soon as he has the new appraisal to show that he is not\nresponsible for the debts and that the loan for which he is being held responsible was\nfraudulently obtained. \nThe second financial allegation concerns repossession of a new vehicle in 2002\npurchased by his uncle in Applicant\u2019s name using the power of attorney Applicant\nprovided to him. It has now been removed from his credit report because the creditor\nhas agreed that it was obtained through identity theft (Exh. 8). He has also obtained\nletters advising of corrections in his credit reports based on identity theft by his uncle\n(Exhs. 8, 9, and 10). In 2006, he attempted to hire legal counsel (Exhs. A) but the\nattorney declined to take the case because of the distance from his office to the courts\nwhere the action occurred (Exh. 11). Applicant has since attempted to resolve the\nmatter himself. He filed a fraud and identity theft complaint against his uncle (Exh. 12).\nApplicant is unmarried but has two children by the woman with whom he lives\nwho is employed. They have joint income of over $5,000 a month with over $1,000 left\nover after expenses each month (Exh. 3). He received a salary increase this year of\n$2,600 per year. His credit reports and testimony indicates that he has had no other\nfinancial difficulties. He has been unable to buy a home for his family since the failed\neffort in 2004 and will not be able to do so until he clears up the present delinquent debt\nin this matter and his credit rating is restored. \nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching\n\n4\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours.\nDecisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the Applicant may\ndeliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified information. Such\ndecisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential,\nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7 of Executive\nOrder 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall\nin no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also\nEO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or\nsensitive information).\nAnalysis\nGuideline F Financial\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial concerns is set out in\nAG \u00b6 18:\nFailure or inability to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially over-\nextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.\nCompulsive gambling is a concern as it may lead to financial crimes\n\n5\nincluding espionage. Affluence that cannot be explained by known sources\nof income is also a security concern. It may indicate proceeds from\nfinancially profitable criminal acts.\nAG \u00b6 19 describes several conditions that might be applicable and could raise a\nsecurity concern and may be disqualifying:\n(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts;\n(b) indebtedness caused by frivolous or irresponsible spending and the\nabsence of any evidence of willingness or intent to pay the debt or\nestablish a realistic plan to pay the debt;\n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and,\n(d) deceptive or illegal financial practices such as embezzlement,\nemployee theft, check fraud, income tax evasion, expense account fraud,\nfiling deceptive loan statements, and other intentional financial breaches\nof trust.\nAG \u00b6 20 describes several conditions that could mitigate security concerns that\nmight be applicable in this matter. They are that:\n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred\nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast\ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely\nbeyond the person\u2019s control, and the individual acted responsibly under\nthe circumstances; \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the\npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides\ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides\nevidence of actions to resolve the issue.\nApplicant was alleged to have two delinquent debts. The auto repossession, has\nbeen resolved since the creditor acknowledged that it was caused by identity theft.\nThus, only the mortgage issue remains to be resolved and Applicant has shown a series\nof actions taken by him over the past two years to illustrate how the debt occurred and\nhis efforts to resolve the debt. While the actions he has taken may not have been as\nprompt as they might have been or as successful as he hoped, I find that the he has\ntaken sufficient action to warrant the application of the above mitigating conditions in\nthis matter. Because the actions occurred in another state far removed from Applicant\u2019s\nhome and he was unaware of it for some time, he has had difficulty getting to the\n\n6\nbottom of the fraudulent activity. However, since he became aware of the problem at the\nend of December 2005, he has taken many steps to resolve it. \nIdentity theft and the fraudulent financial activity that often ensues is well known\nto be a complicated issue to resolve in a timely matter often involving not only time but\nalso money. While Applicant\u2019s actions in giving a power of attorney to another, even a\nrelative, was not a prudent decision, he was not a sophisticated investor and thought he\ncould trust his close relative. He realizes the mistakes he made and is quite unlikely to\nrepeat them again. \nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation\nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent\nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.\nApplicant has a responsible position in the defense industry where he has been\nemployed for the past ten years. He has had no legal difficulties during that period and\nthe current problems arising from the failed real estate efforts are the first difficulties he\nhas had of a financial nature. He has presented evidence in this matter to show the\nhistory of the problem and the efforts he has made to resolve them to my satisfaction.\nHe successfully persuaded the creditor in his automobile repossession allegation to\ndrop the matter after showing them some of the same evidence he has produced in this\nmatter. The real estate transaction is more complex than the auto repossession and has\ntaken longer to resolve. \nI find that the facts surrounding the allegations are not likely to recur, were not\nthe Applicant\u2019s fault, and he had not only no motivation for any misconduct, but knew\nnothing about it until December 2004. He has motivation to resolve the issue and have\nhis credit rating restored so that he might be able to transact business without the\nburden of an adverse credit rating. \n\n7\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a.:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b.:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c.:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance at this time. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.\n_________________\nCHARLES D. ABLARD\nAdministrative Judge\n",

On August 30, 2006, the Under Secretary of Defense (Intelligence) published a memorandum directing\napplication of revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) to all adjudications and other determinations made under the Directive and Department of Defense\n(DoD) Regulation 5200.2-R, Personnel Security Program (Regulation), dated January 1987, as amended, in which the SOR was issued\non or after September 1, 2006.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn January 30, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nissued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR), alleging facts and security concerns\nunder Guideline F (Financial Considerations). The SOR informed Applicant that\nbased on the available information, DOHA adjudicators could not make a\npreliminary affirmative finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest\nto grant him access to classified information and submitted the case to an\nadministrative judge for a security determination.1\nOn February 20, 2007, Applicant answered the SOR. He admitted all of the\nSOR allegations, and requested a decision without a hearing. On April 19, 2007,\nDepartment Counsel prepared a File of Relevant Material (FORM), which was\nmailed to Applicant on April 20, 2007. He acknowledged receipt of the FORM on\nApril 23, 2007, and did not object to anything contained in the FORM or submit\nadditional information for consideration within the 30-day period provided to him.\nThe case was assigned to me on June 28, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant admitted all SOR allegations.

He\nclaimed his earnings only allow him to pay for his day-to-day living expenses and\ncurrent obligations. He is paying past due state and federal taxes for tax years 2004\nand 2005. After paying his past due taxes, he has no money left to pay his old debts.\nApplicant promised to contact his creditors, and to pay his delinquent obligations\nwhen his wife begins working.

Apr. 3, 2006) (Substantial evidence is\nsuch relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary\nevidence in the record); Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1.\n  Egan, supra n.6, at 528, 531.\n8\ndisqualifying or mitigating condition is not determinative of a conclusion for or\nagainst an Applicant. Each decision must also reflect a fair and impartial common\nsense consideration of the factors listed in Section 6.3 of the Directive, and the\n4\nwhole person concept. Having considered the record evidence as a whole, I conclude\n5\nGuideline F (Financial Considerations) is the applicable relevant adjudicative\nguideline.\nBURDEN OF PROOF\nThe purpose of a security clearance decision is to resolve whether it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s eligibility for\naccess to classified information. The government has the initial burden of proving\n6\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. To meet its burden, the government must\nestablish a prima facie case by substantial evidence. The responsibility then shifts to\n7\nthe applicant to refute, extenuate or mitigate the government\u2019s case. Because no one\nhas a right to a security clearance, the applicant carries the ultimate burden of\npersuasion.8\n\n  See Id; AG \u00b6 2(b).\n9\n  AG \u00b6 18.\n10\n  See ISCR Case No. 03- 02374 at 4 (App. Bd. Jan. 26, 2006) (citing ISCR Case No. 02-22173 at 4 (App. Bd.\n11\nMay 26, 2004)). When making a recency analysis for FC MC 1, all debts are considered as a whole.\nA person who has access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government based on trust and confidence. The government,\ntherefore, has a compelling interest to ensure each applicant possesses the requisite\njudgment, reliability and trustworthiness of one who will protect the national\ninterests as his or her own. The \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d\nstandard compels resolution of any reasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability\nfor access to classified information in favor of protecting national security.9\nCONCLUSIONS\nUnder Guideline F (Financial Considerations), the government\u2019s concern is\n10\nthat an Applicant\u2019s failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and\nmeet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified\ninformation. An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to\nengage in illegal acts to generate funds.\nApplicant has a history of failing to meet his financial obligations dating back\nto 1997. Since 1997, he has accumulated at least 19 delinquent/charged off debts\ntotaling approximately $29,000, which have been delinquent for many years. In\nDecember 2006, Applicant was confronted about his financial problems by DOHA\nand asked to provide documentation verifying payments and current status of his\ndelinquent accounts. He provided no information to show he has in any way\nattempted to resolve any of his debts. In April 2007, Applicant was provided a copy\nof the FORM stating the government\u2019s security concerns. He presented no evidence\nto show he has taken any action to resolve his debts. Financial Considerations\nDisqualifying Condition (FC DC) \u00b6 19(a): inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts;\nand FC DC \u00b6 19(c): a history of not meeting financial obligations; apply in this case.\nConsidering the record evidence as a whole, I conclude that none of the\n11\nmitigating conditions apply. Applicant presented no evidence of efforts taken to\ncontact creditors, or to resolve any of the debts since he acquired them. Nor is there\nany evidence that he has participated in any financial counseling, or that\ncircumstances beyond his control prevented him from resolving his debts.  \n\nKEYWORD: Financial\nDIGEST: Applicant has a history of failing to meet his financial obligations dating back to 1997.\nAs of the date of his response to the FORM, he had 19 accounts totaling approximately $29,000,\nwhich had been delinquent for many years. His evidence is insufficient to show that he is in control\nof his finances, is not overextended, and has a track record of financial responsibility.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On March 29, 2007, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of\n\nThe Judge found in favor of Applicant with respect to SOR paragraphs 1.a and 3a.  Those favorable findings\n1\nare not at issue on appeal.\n2\nthe basis for that decision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations),\nGuideline J (Criminal Conduct) and Guideline E (Personal Conduct) of Department of Defense\nDirective 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.  On July\n11, 2007, after the hearing, Administrative Judge Noreen A. Lynch denied Applicant\u2019s request for\na security clearance.  Applicant timely appealed pursuant to the Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge erred as to her findings;\nwhether the Judge erred by concluding that the security concerns raised under Guidelines F and J had\nnot been mitigated.1\n(1) Applicant argues that the Judge erred with respect to two of her findings: (a) in the\nsynopsis the Judge stated that $13,000 in delinquent debt had been incurred, when only $7,844 had\nbeen incurred, and (b) in the decision she stated Applicant had approximately $45,000 in car loans\nand about $1,000 in monthly payments, instead of $38,000 in car loans and $788 in monthly\npayments.\nThe Board reviews a Judge\u2019s decision in its entirety, not just isolated sentences, to discern\nwhat the Judge found and concluded.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 02-30587 at 3 (App. Bd. Jun. 15,\n2005).  Absent unusual circumstances, any flaws or errors in the synopsis of a Judge\u2019s decision are\nnot likely to be harmful.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 02-23336 at 3-4 (App. Bd. May 10, 2004).  In this\ncase, the delinquent debts in question were accurately discussed in the body of the Judge\u2019s decision,\nso any error in the synopsis would be harmless.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 05-03846 at 4 (App. Bd.\nNov. 14, 2006).  With respect to the amount of Applicant\u2019s car loans and monthly payments, even\nif each of the challenged findings were changed to reflect Applicant\u2019s interpretation of the record\nevidence, it would not have undermined the Judge\u2019s ultimate conclusions.  Therefore, any such error\nwould be, at most, harmless.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 04-00949 at 2 (App. Bd. Mar. 27, 2007);\nISCR Case No. 05-08459 at 2, n. 1 (App. Bd. Nov. 16, 2006).\nThe Board\u2019s review of a Judge\u2019s findings is limited to determining if they are supported by\nsubstantial evidence\u2014such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to\nsupport such a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the record.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1.\n\u201cThis is something less than the weight of the evidence, and the possibility of drawing two\ninconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent an administrative agency\u2019s finding from\nbeing supported by substantial evidence.\u201d Consolo v. Federal Maritime Comm\u2019n, 383 U.S. 607, 620,\n(1966).  The Board does not review a case de novo.  Applicant has not met his burden of\ndemonstrating that the Judge\u2019s material findings as to Applicant\u2019s conduct of security concern do\nnot reflect a reasonable or plausible interpretation of the record evidence.  Considering the record\nevidence as a whole, the Judge\u2019s material findings of security concern are supported by substantial\nevidence and are sustainable.\n \n\n3\n(2) Applicant also argues that the Judge\u2019s adverse decision should be reversed because the\nJudge did not give sufficient weight to Applicant\u2019s mitigating evidence which showed that: (a)\nApplicant\u2019s indebtedness was not excessive; (b) the disqualifying conduct was isolated and not\nrecent; (c) there were clear indications that the problem was being resolved or under control; and (d)\nApplicant had initiated a good faith effort to repay the overdue creditors or otherwise resolve the\ndebts.  In support of his argument, Applicant cites to other DOHA Hearing Office decisions,\nincluding one by the same Judge, in which applicants in ostensibly similar circumstances had been\ngranted a clearance or trustworthiness designation.  Applicant\u2019s arguments do not demonstrate error\non the part of the Judge.\nThe Board gives due consideration to the Hearing Office cases which Applicant has cited in\nhis appeal brief.  However, the decision in another Hearing Office case is not legally binding\nprecedent on Hearing Office Judges or the Board, even if an applicant can establish close factual\nsimilarities between the cases.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 04-04004 at 2 (App. Bd. Jul. 31, 2006). \nTherefore, the Judge was not legally obligated to reconcile her decisions in this case with Hearing\nOffice decisions in other ostensibly similar cases.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 02-24752 at 3 (App. Bd.\nJul. 31, 2006).  Under the Directive, the Judges was required to use a whole person analysis, which\nevaluated the totality of the individual circumstances of Applicant\u2019s case, in reaching her\ndetermination as to his security eligibility.  \nOnce the government presents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the\napplicant to establish mitigation.  The application of disqualifying and mitigating conditions and\nwhole-person factors does not turn simply on a finding that one or more of them apply to the\nparticular facts of a case.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 01-14740 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan.15, 2003).  Thus,\nthe presence of some mitigating evidence does not alone compel the Judge to make a favorable\nsecurity clearance decision.  As the trier of fact, the Judge has to weigh the evidence as a whole and\ndecide whether the favorable evidence outweighs the unfavorable evidence, or vice versa.  An\napplicant\u2019s disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, or an ability to argue for a\ndifferent interpretation of the evidence, is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed the\nevidence or reached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.\nIn this case, the Judge found that Applicant had a lengthy and serious history of not meeting\nfinancial obligations.  That history included failure to file his federal tax returns, and to pay those\ntaxes, for two years.  At the time of the hearing, Applicant was still subject to a tax lien and was still\nin the process of paying off his back taxes.  In light of the foregoing, the Judge could reasonably\nconclude that Applicant\u2019s financial problems were still ongoing.   See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 05-07747\nat 2 (App. Bd. Jul. 3, 2007).  The Judge weighed the mitigating evidence offered by Applicant\nagainst the length and seriousness of the disqualifying conduct and considered the possible\napplication of relevant mitigating conditions and whole person factors.  The Judge found in favor\nof Applicant with respect to several of the factual allegations.  However, the Judge reasonably\nexplained why the evidence which the Applicant had presented in mitigation was insufficient to\novercome all of the government\u2019s security concerns.  The Board does not review a case de novo.\nApplicant is, at most, offering a plausible alternative interpretation of the record evidence.  The\nfavorable evidence cited by Applicant is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge\u2019s decision is\narbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ADP Case No. 03-14873 at 2 (App. Bd. Sep. 28,\n2006).  Given the record that was before her, the Judge\u2019s ultimate unfavorable security clearance\n\n4\ndecision under Guidelines F and J is sustainable.\nOrder\nThe decision of the Judge denying Applicant a security clearance is AFFIRMED.\nSigned: Michael Y.

LYNCH\nAPPEARANCES\nFOR GOVERNMENT\nJohn B. Glendon, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nSYNOPSIS\nApplicant incurred approximately $13,000 in delinquent debt, including unpaid federal taxes\nfrom 1993 and 1994. Despite his recent payments, he has failed to mitigate the security concerns\n\n2\nraised under the financial considerations guideline. Applicant\u2019s failure to file his federal tax returns\nfor two years is a disqualification under criminal conduct. Applicant\u2019s incorrect answer on his\nsecurity application was not an intentional falsification. Applicant has mitigated the personal conduct\nconcern. Applicant's eligibility for a security clearance is denied due to failure to mitigate the\ncriminal conduct and financial considerations concerns. Clearance is denied.\n\nThis action was taken under Executive Order 10865, dated February 20, 1960, as amended, and DoD Directive\n1\n5220.6, dated January 2, 1992, as amended and modified (Directive).\nApplicant waived his right to 15 days notice.\n2\n(Applicant\u2019s Answer to SOR, dated May 3, 2007.\n3\nGX 1 (Application for Security Clearance (SF 86), dated April 26, 2006 ).\n4\nId.\n5\n3\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn March 29, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement\nof Reasons (SOR) to Applicant.  The SOR, alleges  security concerns under Guideline F (Financial\n1\nConsiderations), Guideline J (Criminal Conduct) and Guideline E (Personal Conduct) of the revised\nAdjudicative Guidelines (AG) issued on December 29, 2005, and implemented by the Department\nof Defense effective September 1, 2006. The revised guidelines were provided to Applicant when\nthe SOR was issued. The SOR detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary finding\nunder the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a\nsecurity clearance for him, and recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine\nwhether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.\nApplicant submitted an undated, notarized response to the SOR allegations, and elected to\nhave his case decided at a hearing. On May 29, 2007, the case was assigned to me. A Notice of\nHearing was issued on June 4, 2007.  At the June 13, 2007 hearing, the Government introduced\n2\nGovernment Exhibits (GX) 1 through 5 into evidence without objections. Applicant testified and\nintroduced Applicant Exhibits (AX) A through H into evidence without objections from Department\nCounsel. DOHA received the transcript on June 26, 2007. At Applicant\u2019s request, I held the record\nopen until June 20, 2007. Applicant timely filed a document. This submission was marked and\nentered into the record as AX I. Department Counsel had no objection.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant denied all allegations in his SOR response under Guideline F, Guideline J and\nGuideline E.  After a complete review of the evidence in the record and upon due consideration, I\n3\nmake the following findings of fact:\nApplicant is a 44-year-old employee of a defense contractor. After graduation from high\nschool, he served in the military from 1985 until his honorable discharge in 1989. In 1986, while in\nthe military, he received a two-year degree from a Military Community College. He has worked for\nhis current employer since July 2005. Applicant is divorced three times with two grown children.4\nHe is currently married with two stepchildren. On April 26, 2006, he completed his security\nclearance (SF 86) application.5\nWhen Applicant was divorced in January 1987 from his second wife, the mother of his two\nchildren, he paid child support. An agreement was made that his ex-wife would claim their son on\n\nAX H (Divorce Agreement, dated January 1987).\n6\nTr. 35.\n7\nTr. 56-57.\n8\nTr. 36.\n9\nGX 4 (Certificate of Release of Federal Tax Lien, Internal Revenue Service, January 5, 2007).\n10\nTr. 41.\n11\nGX 5 (Monthly Statement, Internal Revenue Service, dated April 11, 2007).\n12\nTr. 50.\n13\n4\nher federal and state tax filings and Applicant would claim their daughter on his state and federal\nincome tax returns, as long as he was not in arrears on his child support obligation.6\nAt some point, Applicant\u2019s ex-wife claimed both children on her federal income tax return.\nApplicant was not aware that she had filed the exemption. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS)\ncontacted Applicant for his tax return for 1993 and 1994. They wanted to know why both had\nclaimed the children. Applicant called the IRS and learned that since his daughter had resided with\nher mother for the majority of the year, she was allowed to claim the daughter as an exemption\ndespite the agreement incorporated in the divorce decree.7\nApplicant did not file his federal income taxes for the next two years based on some advice\nhe maintained an attorney provided him. He did not have a name for the attorney and revealed after\nquestioning that he found someone in the yellow pages and called on the phone but did not retain\nthe attorney.  Applicant maintained that the attorney advised him not to file his income tax returns\n8\nuntil he could resolve the matter concerning the exemption. Applicant never followed up with a visit\n9\nto the attorney. However, he maintains, that he was told it was not a federal crime to not file the tax\nreturns. Applicant explained that the attorney told him as long as he paid taxes, there would be no\nproblem. The reasoning was that until the matter was resolved, he did not actually owe the taxes.\nAs a result of not filing taxes for two years, Applicant owed the IRS. A tax lien in the amount\nof $7,844 was filed against him in June 1997. The IRS released the lien in January 5, 2007.  A new\n10\nlien was filed in March 2004 in the amount of $5,185. Applicant filed his taxes for 1993 and 1994\nin 2002 or 2003.11\nApplicant owes the IRS approximately $3,115.77 on the 2004 tax lien. He received a refund\nin 2006 and that was applied against the balance. He now has a payment plan in place.  He pays $100\na month to the IRS which he started sometime in 2006.12\nIn January 2007, Applicant purchased two vehicles. He has two car loans for a total of\napproximately $45,000. His monthly payments are about $1,000.13\nApplicant\u2019s debt to a collection company for a cell phone in the amount of $506 is still\nreported on his latest credit report. Applicant disputes this account. He contested it with two credit\n\nTr. 52.\n14\nTr. 55.\n15\nAX C (Recommendation Letter from Facility Security Officer).\n16\nAX D (Recommendation Letter from Supervisor).\n17\nAX E and F (Performance Review for 2006 and 2007).\n18\n Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 527 (1988).  \n19\n5\nreporting bureaus.   After they researched the account, the debt was reported as confirmed to\n14\nApplicant. He has not followed up on the account to correct the situation.\nApplicant does not deny that he was indebted to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for tax\nyears 1993 and 1994, and moreover, did not file his tax returns. However, he claims he has been\npaying $100 per month since 2005, and that his 2006 federal tax refunds were applied to the debt.\nHe asserts the amount owed is approximately $3,100. Applicant submitted a monthly statement\ndated, April 11, 2007 from the IRS indicating that his last monthly payment of $100 was received.\nWhen Applicant completed his security clearance application on April 24, 2006, he\nresponded \u201cno\u201d to Section 27. c Your Financial Record: In the last 7 years, have you had a lien\nplaced against your property for failing to pay taxes or other debts? However, he responded \u201cyes\u201d\nand checked the box to Section 27. d. In the last 7 years, have you had any judgments against you\nthat have not been paid. He provided detailed information regarding a tax lien for 1992. However,\nhe asserts there was no tax lien for 1992 but rather 1997. This was an error on his part.  He did not\nrecord his March 2004 tax lien because he did not know about it at the time. He actually filled out\na first security application in April 2005 when he was a temporary with the employer. He was asked\nto re-file in 2006. When he did so, he just updated addresses.  \n15\nApplicant\u2019s current supervisor  and facility security office wrote that Applicant is trustworthy\nand dependable. He is willing to work on anything and is very helpful.  He is a hard working\n16\ntechnician and employee. In addition, his position requires diligence, attention to detail and\nexemplary security protocol as to all things pertaining to the national defense. Applicant served\nadmirably in his capacity.  They both recommend Applicant highly. His latest performance reviews\n17\nare fully satisfactory.18\nPOLICIES\nThe President has \u201cthe authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national\nsecurity and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position \u2026 that\nwill give that person access to such information.\u201d   In Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\n19\nClassified Information Within Industry (Feb. 20, 1960), the President set out guidelines and\nprocedures for safeguarding classified information and determining trustworthiness within the\nexecutive branch. \n\n Directive, \u00b6 E2.2.1.\n20\n Directive, Revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) 2 (a)(1)-(9).\n21\n Id.\n22\n Directive, \u00b6 E3.1.14.\n23\n Directive, \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n24\n ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd.

The revised Adjudicative Guidelines set forth\npotentially disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) under each guideline.\nAdditionally, each security decision must be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based on the\nrelevant and material facts and circumstances, the whole-person concept, along with the adjudicative\nprocess factors listed in \u00b6 6.3 of the Directive, and AG \u00b6 2(a).\n\u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make\nan affirmative determination that the person is eligible for a security clearance.\u201d    An administrative\n20\njudge must apply the \u201cwhole person concept,\u201d and consider and carefully weigh the available, reliable\ninformation about the person.   An administrative judge should consider the following factors: (1)\n21\nthe nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to\ninclude knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the\npresence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for\nthe conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of\ncontinuation or recurrence.   \n22\nInitially, the Government must present evidence to establish controverted facts in the SOR that\ndisqualify or may disqualify the applicant from being eligible for access to classified information.23\nThereafter, the applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or\nmitigate the facts.  An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent\n24\nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d  Any doubt as to whether\n25\naccess to classified information is clearly consistent with national security will be resolved in favor\nof the national security.26\nThe scope of an administrative judge\u2019s decision is limited. Nothing in this Decision should\nbe construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole or in part, on any express or implied\ndeterminations as to Applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or patriotism.\nCONCLUSIONS\nI have carefully considered all the facts in evidence and the legal standards. Discussed above.\nI reach the following conclusions regarding the allegations in the SOR.\n\nAG \u00b6 18.\n27\n7\n \nGuideline F:Financial Considerations \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial obligations\nmay indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations,\nall of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information. An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in\nillegal acts to generate funds.27\nBased on all the evidence, Financial Considerations Disqualifying Condition (FC DC) 19(a)\n(inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts), FC DC 19(c) (a history of not meeting financial\nobligations), and FC DC 19(g) (failure to file annual federal, state, or local income tax returns as\nrequired or the fraudulent filing of the same) apply in this case. Applicant did not file his federal tax\nreturns for 1993 and 1994. He did not pay  his federal taxes, resulting in liens of $7,844 and $5,158.\nHe has a delinquent account in the amount of $506.\nWith the government\u2019s case established, the burden shifts to Applicant to present evidence of\nrefutation, extenuation, or mitigation to overcome the case against him. I considered the Financial\nConsiderations Mitigating Condition (FC MC) 20(a), (the behavior happened so long ago, was so\ninfrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt\non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment), FC MC 20(b) (the\nconditions that resulted in the behavior were largely beyond the person's control (e.g., loss of\nemployment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce, or separation)\nand the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances), FC MC 20 (c) (the person has received\nor is receiving counseling for the problem and/ or there are clear indications that the problem is being\nresolved or under control), FC MC 20(d) (the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue\ncreditors or otherwise resolve debts), and FC MC 20(e) (the individual has a reasonable basis to\ndispute the legitimacy of the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented\nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions to resolve the issue).\nApplicant is now paying $100 a month on his unsatisfied tax lien. The lien from June 1997 was\nreleased on January 5, 2007. He still has an outstanding account from many years ago that has not been\nresolved. Applicant blamed his not filing due to advice he received from an attorney. I do not give that\nany weight and do not find that credible. His recent payments to the IRS do not mitigate his earlier\nfinancial irresponsibility. There is no evidence that he acted responsibly under the circumstances. \nThe issue is not whether Applicant is still legally liable for any or all of his outstanding debts,\nbut whether he has presented sufficient evidence of extenuation, mitigation or changed circumstances\nto warrant a favorable security determination.  Applicant has not mitigated the government\u2019s concerns\nunder Guideline F.\nGuideline J: Criminal Conduct\n\n8\nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness.\nBy its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules\nand regulations. \nApplicant did not file his federal tax returns for 1993 and 1994. Criminal Conduct\nDisqualifying Condition (CC DC) AG \u00b6 31(a) (a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses)\napplies. Applicant acknowledged that he did not file his federal returns. However, I do not find him\ncredible in his assertion that he was told not to do so from a phone call with an attorney. He had been\nadvised from the IRS that his wife could claim his daughter as an exemption since she resided with\nher the majority of the year. He wilfully failed to file his federal income tax returns, in violation of 26\nU.S.C. \u00a77203.\nI do not find that any of the mitigating conditions apply.\nGuideline E: Personal Conduct\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to\ncomply with rules and regulations can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability,\ntrustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information. Of special interest is any failure to\nprovide truthful and candid answers during the security clearance process or any other failure to\ncooperate with the security clearance process.\nApplicant answered Question 27 (d) and provided detailed information about a tax lien. He\nchecked this box for owing on a judgment instead of a tax lien. I find him credible in that this was an\nerror on his part. I do not find that he intentionally falsified his security application in April 2006.\nThus, Personal Conduct Disqualifying Condition (PC DC) 16 (a) (deliberate omission, concealment,\nor falsification of relevant facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement,\nor similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefit\nor status, determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary\nresponsibilities) does not apply.\nWhole Person\nIn all adjudications, the protection of our national security is the paramount concern. The\nobjective of the trustworthy determination process is the fair-minded, commonsense assessment of a\nperson\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the person is eligible for assignment to sensitive\nduties. Indeed, the adjudicative process is a careful weighing of a number of variables in considering\nthe \u201cwhole person\u201d concept. It recognizes that we should view a person by the totality of their acts,\nomissions, motivations and other variables. Each case must be adjudged on its own merits, taking into\nconsideration all relevant circumstances, and applying sound judgment, mature thinking, and careful\nanalysis.\nI have considered all the evidence and the \u201cwhole person\u201d in evaluating Applicant\u2019s security\nclearance determination. Aan applicant with a good or even exemplary work history may engage in\nconduct that has negative implications or presents doubt about his judgment. Despite steady\nemployment, Applicant has accrued delinquent accounts and failed to pay his federal income tax for\n\n9\ntwo years in 1993 and 1994. It is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant a\nsecurity clearance. Clearance is denied.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal Findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required\nby Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1.

He was born, grew up, and was \neducated in India. He became a naturalized U.S. citizen in April 2000. Applicant\u2019s ties of \naffection and/or obligation and contacts with his wife, children, parents, in-laws, friends, and \nbusiness associates most whom are citizens and residents of India, in conjunction with his \nbusiness, property, and investments in India, pose an unacceptable security risk or concern. His \nfavorable information is not sufficient to mitigate the foreign influence security concerns. \nClearance is denied. \n\n \n                                                                                                                                          \n \n2\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE \n \nOn July 26, 2005, Applicant submitted a security clearance application (GE 1, Electronic \nQuestionnaires for Investigations Processing). On May 11, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings \nand Appeals (DOHA) issued Applicant a statement of reasons (SOR) alleging facts and security \nconcerns under Guideline B (Foreign Influence). The SOR informed Applicant that DOHA \nadjudicators could not make a preliminary affirmative finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant him access to classified information and submitted the case to an \nadministrative judge for a security determination.1 On May 31, 2007, Applicant answered the \nSOR and requested a hearing.  \n \nThe case was assigned to me on August 7, 2007. DOHA issued a Notice of Hearing on \nAugust 14, 2007, convening a hearing on August 31, 2007. Applicant\u2019s attorney requested a \ncontinuance by motion dated August 23, 2007, citing medical and personal reasons.2 The \nGovernment did not object to the motion. I granted a postponement, and rescheduled the hearing \nfor October 15, 2007. The hearing was convened as rescheduled. At the hearing, the government \npresented three exhibits, marked GE 1-3, to support the SOR. Applicant testified on his own \nbehalf, and presented one exhibit with 31 enclosures, marked AE 1a-ee. DOHA received the \ntranscript (Tr.) on November 21, 2007. \n \n \nFINDINGS OF FACT \n \nApplicant admitted all the SOR allegations with explanations. His admissions are \nincorporated herein as findings of fact. After a thorough review of all evidence of record, I make \nthe following additional findings of fact.  \n \n \n \nApplicant is 40 years old. He was born, raised, and educated in the Republic of India \n(India) (GE 1). After completing his Bachelor\u2019s degree in Business Administration in India, he \nimmigrated to the United States at age 21 under a student visa. Two years later he received a \nMaster\u2019s of Science in Business Administration degree from a U.S. university (Tr. 40). He \nremained in the United States working as a software consultant. He became a naturalized U.S. \ncitizen in April 2000. \n \nIn 1995, Applicant founded his own information technology (IT) company. Initially the \ncompany was oriented toward commercial clients. After 2001, Applicant moved his company to \nthe Government sector to diversity and to mitigate his business risk. Over the last three years, \n                                                          \n1  See Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry (Feb. 20, 1960, as \namended, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (Jan. 2, 1992) (Directive), as amended and revised. On August 30, 2006, the Under Secretary of Defense \n(Intelligence) published a memorandum directing application of revised Adjudicative Guidelines to all adjudications \nand other determinations made under the Directive and Department of Defense (DoD) Regulation 5200.2-R, \nPersonnel Security Program (Regulation), dated January 1987, as amended, in which the SOR was issued on or \nafter September 1, 2006.  \n \n2  Applicant\u2019s Motion for Continuance, along with its cover sheet, were marked as Appellate Exhibit (App. \nExh.) 1. \n\n \n                                                                                                                                          \n \n3\nApplicant\u2019s company has acquired contracts with state and federal government agencies. \nApplicant also owns a second company which is a holding company for the real estate and \nbuildings used by his IT company. As sole owner and principal officer of his IT company, he \nneeds a security clearance for his company to handle certain Government contracts. After he \napplied for a security clearance in 2005, Applicant was granted an interim security clearance that \nwas revoked in May 2005 with the issuance of the pending SOR (Tr. 104).  \n \nApplicant\u2019s wife is currently a citizen and resident of India. In 1989, she travelled to the \nUnited States under a student visa, and finished her physical therapist degree in 1991. Applicant \nand his wife met while both attended the same U.S. university. In 1992, they traveled to India to \nbe married in a family ceremony. Applicant has three children born in the United States of this \nmarriage, a daughter age 13, and two boys ages 11 and 9. From 1991 to 1998, Applicant and his \nfamily lived in the United States. In 1998, Applicant and his wife decided she would move with \ntheir children to India. They wanted their children to grow up in India in the same environment \nand with the same cultural heritage Applicant and his wife received (Tr. 108). They also wanted \ntheir children to spent time with their grandparents. His wife has not applied for citizenship \nbecause she does not meet the residence requirements (Tr. 105). \n \nIn 1999, Applicant\u2019s wife established a company in India with the same name as \nApplicant\u2019s company in the United States (Tr. 111). The Indian company was established with \nApplicant\u2019s wife as the sole owner to take advantage of economic benefits in India available only \nto native Indian investors/owners (Tr. 112). Because of his U.S. citizenship, if Applicant was \nincluded as an owner the company would not have been entitled to any Indian economic benefits. \nApplicant\u2019s company and his wife\u2019s company have worked together since 1999. The Indian \ncompany was created to support Applicant\u2019s company in the United States (Tr. 166), and to \ncompete for business partnerships with American companies seeking business partners in India. \nAs of the day of the hearing, the Indian company was \u201cdormant,\u201d but it still had 4-5 people in \nIndia working for Applicant\u2019s U.S. company. Between 2000 and 2004, the Indian company \nproduced revenues of approximately $200,000 a year (Tr. 116). Applicant\u2019s wife and his mother \nwere appointed \u201cDirectors\u201d of the Indian company and they oversaw its operations. Their \npositions were not full time jobs, and they usually worked one day a week. Applicant personally \ndid most of the monitoring of the projects assigned to his wife\u2019s Indian company over the \ntelephone, Internet, or during his trips to India (Tr. 113). \n \nBetween April 2000 and his hearing date, Applicant traveled to India 29 times (Tr. 117-\n118). Of those 29 visits, 23 were to visit his family and to explore business opportunities. He was \ntrying to generate additional business with U.S. companies seeking partnership with Indian \ncompanies and to maintain client relationships (Tr. 121). From 2000 to 2006, Applicant spent at \nleast five months, and up to 10 months in 2002, of each year living in India (Tr. 124). He intends \nto travel to India in November 2007 for business and to visit his family (Tr. 83). \n \nIn January 2007, Applicant\u2019s wife and children moved to the United States with the intent \nto remain permanently in the United States (Tr. 60). The children briefly attended U.S. schools. \nHis wife and children traveled during the summer vacation to India to visit their family. Her 75-\nyear-old father became ill, and she and the children stayed in India to help with his care. They \nare waiting for her father to get better and then plan to return to the United States. \n\n \n                                                                                                                                          \n \n4\n \nAs of the SOR date, Applicant owned three apartments free and clear in India. One he \npurchased in 1991 for his parents to live in. The apartment is still registered in the builder\u2019s name \nbecause of a legal dispute. Applicant had planned to have his name and his parents name placed \ninto the deed (Tr. 64-65). However, due to the security clearance concerns raised by his owning \nproperty in India, Applicant testified he intends to transfer the apartment ownership to his \nparents. His parent\u2019s apartment is worth approximately $100,000. The second apartment he \npurchased in 1999 for him and his wife to live in (Tr. 110). This apartment is worth \napproximately $130,000. The family outgrew it, and in 2004 he purchased a third apartment for \nhim and his family to live in (Tr. 110). It is worth approximately $170,000. The smaller \napartment was rented to a friend, and he kept it as an investment property. Because of the \nsecurity clearance concerns raised by his owning property in India, Applicant relinquished all \nproperty rights to both apartments to his wife (Tr. 66-67, AE 1r, s, and t).  \n \nApplicant and his wife have had one joint bank account in India for the last 10 years. He \nputs money in it to support his wife, his parents, and for him to write checks (Tr. 69-70). As of \nOctober 2007, he had approximately $18,000 in the account. During the last five years he has \nhad a fixed monthly deposit of around $10,000-$12,000 deposited into the account (Tr. 75).  \n \nWhen Applicant\u2019s wife is living in India and he is in the United States, Applicant \ncontacts his wife every day by telephone or the Internet. He has contacts with his parents at least \ntwice a week. He contacts his parents-in-law once a month (Tr. 90), and has contact with his two \nretired Army uncles about once every two years. He had contacts with his wife\u2019s sibling two to \nfour times a year.  \n \nWhile living in India, Applicant had frequent personal contacts with most of his family \nmembers, in-laws, friends, and professional associates. He has contacts with his parents daily, \nwith his uncles two to four times a week (Tr. 126), and his in-laws once a week. Applicant has \ncontacts with his friends and professional associates almost daily, since most of them work for \nhim. Applicant has five cousins living in the United States who work for him. Two of them are \ngreen card holders, and three have work visas. He has frequent contact with them when he is in \nthe United States. \n \nApplicant and his wife do not own a home in the United States. He explained he has not \npurchased a home in the United States because he has been investing his money to grow his \nbusiness. All of his real estate assets in the United States are owned by a holding company. \nApplicant owns one account in the United States with a value of approximately $51,000. He \nestimates his company\u2019s assets total around 1.5 million dollars (Tr. 81-82). His company \nemploys approximately 50 employees, and has a gross revenue of around $6 million a year. \n \nApplicant\u2019s parents, extended family, most of his friends, and professional associates, as \nwell as his in-laws, and his wife\u2019s extended family, are residents and citizens of India. \nApplicant\u2019s father is a 72-year-old retired colonel who served in the Indian Army. His mother is \na 62-year-old homemaker. Applicant has two maternal uncles that retired as senior officers in the \nIndian Army. He has frequent contact with them when he is in India. Applicant has five friends \nin India with whom he has regular contact. He had frequent contact with a childhood friend who \n\n \n                                                                                                                                          \n \n5\nis a colonel in the Indian Army (once a week). He had infrequent contact with two Indian friends \nliving in Switzerland. He had infrequent contact (two to four times a year) with two other Indian \nfriends residing in India. Applicant has three professional associates, who are residents and \ncitizens of India. He had frequent contact with a professional associate, who is an officer in the \nIndian Army and worked for Applicant in some of the projects Applicant\u2019s company or his \nwife\u2019s company had outsourced in India (Tr. 92).  \n \nApplicant strongly averred he is a loyal U.S. citizen with personal, professional, and \nfinancial commitments in the United States. Applicant is aware of the security concerns raised by \nhis family and friends in India, by his frequent travel to India, and his business and investments \nin India. To minimize the security concerns, he has been moving his business to the United \nStates, and plans to move his wife and children permanently to the United States (Tr. 102). \nApplicant\u2019s sister became a naturalized U.S. citizen within the last two years. She is a U.S. \nresident.  \n \nI take administrative notice of the following facts. India is a democratic, parliamentary, \nfederal republic with a cooperative relationship with the United States. The United States \nrecognizes India as a key to strategic U.S. interests and has sought to strengthen its relationship \nwith India. India has been supportive of U.S. efforts in the global war on terrorism. \n \n \nNotwithstanding, there are concerns about India\u2019s abuses of human rights, government \ncorruption, increasing cooperation with Iran, and India\u2019s lack of protection of U.S. intellectual \nproperty rights. Moreover, India has been identified by the U.S. intelligence community as one \nof the most active collectors of sensitive U.S. economic and proprietary information. Even \nthough India is not hostile to the United States, India\u2019s theft of sensitive and proprietary \ninformation threatens the national security in both military and economic terms. \n \n \n \nPOLICIES \n \nThe Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines which must be considered in evaluating \nan Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. Foremost are the disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions under each adjudicative guideline applicable to the facts and circumstances \nof the case. However, the guidelines are not viewed as inflexible ironclad rules of law. The \npresence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not determinative of a \nconclusion for or against an Applicant. Each decision must also reflect a fair and impartial \ncommon sense consideration of the factors listed in Section 6.3 of the Directive,3 and the whole \nperson concept.4 Having considered the record evidence as a whole, I conclude Guideline B \n(Foreign Influence) is the applicable relevant adjudicative guideline. \n                                                          \n3  Directive, Section 6.3. states, \u201cEach clearance decision must be a fair and impartial common sense \ndetermination based upon consideration of all the relevant and material information and the pertinent criteria and \nadjudication policy in enclosure 2 . . .\u201d \n \n4  AG \u00b6 2(a). states, \u201c. . . The adjudication process is the careful weighing of a number of variables known \nas the whole person concept. Available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, should be considered in reaching a determination. . . .\u201d  \n \n\n \n                                                                                                                                          \n \n6\nBURDEN OF PROOF \n \n \nThe purpose of a security clearance decision is to resolve whether it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation.5 The government has the initial burden of proving controverted facts alleged in the \nSOR. To meet its burden, the government must establish a prima facie case by substantial \nevidence.6 The responsibility then shifts to the applicant to refute, extenuate or mitigate the \ngovernment\u2019s case. Because no one has a right to a security clearance, the applicant carries the \nultimate burden of persuasion.7  \n \n \nA person who has access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship \nwith the government based on trust and confidence. The government, therefore, has a compelling \ninterest to ensure each applicant possesses the requisite judgment, reliability and trustworthiness \nof one who will protect the national interests as his or her own. The \u201cclearly consistent with the \nnational interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any reasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s \nsuitability for access to classified information in favor of protecting national security.8 \n \nThe scope of an administrative judge\u2019s decision is limited. Nothing in this Decision \nshould be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole or in part, on any express \nor implied determination as to Applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or patriotism. Executive Order \n10865, \u00a7 7.  \n \n \nCONCLUSIONS \n  \n  \nUnder Guideline B (Foreign Influence), the government\u2019s concern is that foreign contacts \nand interests may be a security concern if the individual has divided loyalties or foreign financial \ninterests, he or she may be manipulated or induced to help a foreign person, group, organization, \nor government in a way that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by \nany foreign interest. Adjudication under this Guideline can and should consider the identity of \nthe foreign country in which the foreign contact or financial interest is located, including, but not \nlimited to, such considerations as whether the foreign country is known to target United States \ncitizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a risk of terrorism. AG \u00b6 6. \n \nAG \u00b6 7 sets out conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying in \nthis case, including: \n                                                          \n5  See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988). \n \n6  Directive, \u00b6 E3.1.32.1; ISCR Case No. 02-12199 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 3, 2006) (Substantial evidence is \nsuch relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the \ncontrary evidence in the record.); ISCR Case No. 98-0761 at 2 (App. Bd. Dec. 27, 1999) (Substantial evidence is \nmore than a scintilla, but less than a preponderance of the evidence.). \n \n7  Egan, supra n. 5, at 528, 531. \n \n8  See id; AG \u00b6 2(b). \n \n\n \n                                                                                                                                          \n \n7\n                                                          \n \n(a) contact with a foreign family member, business or professional associate, \nfriend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a foreign country if that \ncontact creates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, \nmanipulation, pressure, or coercion; \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that create a \npotential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to protect \nsensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s desire to help a foreign \nperson, group, or country by providing that information;8 * * *  \n \n(d) sharing living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of citizenship \nstatus, if that relationship creates a heightened risk of foreign inducement, \nmanipulation, pressure, or coercion; and  \n \n(e) a substantial business, financial, or property interest in a foreign country, or \nin any foreign-owned or foreign-operated business, which could subject the \nindividual to heightened risk or foreign influence or exploitation. \n \nThe mere possession of close family ties with a person in a foreign country is not, as a \nmatter of law, disqualifying under Guideline B. However, if only one relative lives in a foreign \ncountry, and an applicant has contacts with that relative, this factor alone is sufficient to create \nthe potential for foreign influence and could potentially result in the compromise of classified \ninformation.9 Applicant has frequent contacts and a close relationship of affection and/or \nobligation with his wife, parents, in-laws, his and his wife\u2019s extended family, friends, and \nbusiness associates, who are residents and citizens of India. These contacts create a heightened \nrisk of foreign pressure or attempted exploitation because there is the possibility that Indian \nagents may exploit the opportunity to obtain intelligence, classified, or economic information \nabout the United States.  \n \nHis connection to his family members and with his wife\u2019s family also create a potential \nconflict of interest because his relationships are sufficiently close to raise a security concern \nabout his desire to help them or the government of India by providing sensitive or classified \ninformation. Moreover, Applicant\u2019s business, financial investments, and property interests in \nIndia could subject him to heightened risk of foreign influence. \n \n  \nThe Government produced substantial evidence raising these four potentially \ndisqualifying conditions, and the burden shifted to Applicant to produce evidence and prove a \nmitigating condition. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the \nGovernment. \n \n  \nFour Foreign Influence Mitigating Conditions under Guideline \u00b6 8 are potentially \napplicable to these disqualifying conditions: \n \n9  See ISCR Case No. 03-02382 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 15, 2006); ISCR Case No. 99-0424 (App. Bd. Feb. 8, \n2001). \n \n\n \n                                                                                                                                          \n \n8\n                                                          \n \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which these \npersons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in that country \nare such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a position of having to \nchoose between the interests of a foreign individual, group, organization, or \ngovernment and the interests of the U.S.; \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of loyalty \nor obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country is so minimal, \nor the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in \nthe U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in \nfavor of the U.S. interest; \n \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and infrequent \nthat there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign influence or \nexploitation; and, \n \n(f) the value or routine nature of the foreign business, financial, or property \ninterests is such that they are unlikely to result in a conflict and could not be used \neffectively to influence, manipulate, or pressure the individual. \n \nAfter considering the totality of the facts and circumstances in Applicant\u2019s case, I \nconclude that none of the mitigating conditions apply. The evidence shows Applicant has strong \nfeelings of affection and a strong sense of obligation to his wife\u2019s parents, in-laws, extended \nfamily, and friends. The closeness of the relationships is shown by Applicant\u2019s frequent contacts \nwith them, his frequent travels to India, his prolonged stays in that country, and his purchase of \nreal estate properties for his parents and his wife. Applicant also has significant business \ninvestments in India that compliment his business in the United States. His frequent travel to \nIndia and his lengthy stays in that country also underscore the importance Applicant places in his \nbusiness, financial, and property interests in India.  \n \n \nIn deciding whether Applicant\u2019s family members are in a position to be exploited, I \nconsidered India\u2019s form of government.10 India is a democratic republic with a friendly \nrelationship with the United States. India is a key to strategic U.S. interests, and both countries \nhave worked to strengthen their relationship. India has been supportive of U.S. efforts in the \nglobal war on terrorism. Notwithstanding, the security concerns remain because of India\u2019s active \nrole as a collector of sensitive U.S. economic and proprietary information which could threaten \nU.S. national security in both military and economic terms. \n \nConsidering the totality of the circumstances, Applicant did not establish it is unlikely he \nwill be placed in a position of having to choose between the interests of his family and the \ninterests of the United States. His frequent contacts and close relationship with his family, his \n \n \n10  The focus is not the country or its people. The focus of the analysis is on its rulers and the nature of the \ngovernment they impose. This approach recognizes that it makes sense to treat each country in accordance with the \nlevel of security concern or threat it presents to the United States.  \n \n\n \n                                                                                                                                          \n \n9\n                                                          \nwife\u2019s family, and friends could potentially force him to choose between the United States and \nIndia. There is also an enhanced risk of potential exploitation or influence because of his father, \nuncles, friends, and business associates\u2019 service as senior officers in the Indian Army. Some of \nApplicant\u2019s friends and business associates worked for Applicant in his company\u2019s projects even \nthough they were still serving in the Indian Army. Applicant did not meet his burden of showing \nthere is little likelihood that his relationship with his family, in-laws, and friends could create a \nrisk for foreign influence or exploitation. \n \nAG \u00b6 8(b) partially applies because Applicant has developed a sufficient relationship and \nloyalty to the United States, that he can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of \nthe United States\u2019 interest. He has lived in the United States for approximately 20 years. He is a \nnaturalized U.S. citizen, and his two children were born in the United States. He has substantial \nfinancial and business interests in the United States. Although this mitigating condition is \npartially applicable, these facts are insufficient to overcome the security concerns. \n \n \nIn addition to the enumerated disqualifying and mitigating conditions as discussed \npreviously, I have considered the general adjudicative guidelines related to the whole person \nconcept under AG \u00b6 2(a). \u201cUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must not \nconsider and weigh incidents in an applicant\u2019s life separately, in a piecemeal manner. Rather, the \nJudge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s security eligibility by considering the totality of an \napplicant\u2019s conduct and circumstances.\u201d11 The directive lists nine adjudicative process factors \n(factors) which are used for \u201cwhole person\u201d analysis. Additionally, other \u201c[a]vailable, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be considered \nin reaching a determination.\u201d AG \u00b6 2(a). Ultimately, the clearance decision is \u201can overall \ncommon sense determination.\u201d AG \u00b6 2(c).     \n \nApplicant\u2019s testimony shows Applicant is a loyal U.S. citizen. There is no evidence he \nhas ever taken any action which could cause potential harm to the United States. He takes pride \nin being an American citizen and would like to move all of his family and business to the United \nStates. He has worked diligently for several defense agencies for approximately four years.  \n \nNotwithstanding, his favorable evidence is not sufficient to mitigate the foreign influence \nsecurity concerns. Although Applicant has lived in the United States for almost 20 years, he \ngrew up and was educated in India. He came to the United States at age 21, having spent most of \nhis formative years in India. Although Applicant\u2019s children were born in United States, \nApplicant and his wife have been raising their children in India because they want them \u201cto grow \nup in India in the same environment and with the same cultural heritage\u201d he and his wife \nreceived. His wife has not applied for U.S. citizenship. Applicant purchased three apartments in \nIndia for his parents, wife, and investment purposes. However, he does not own a home in the \nUnited States. Since 2000, Applicant has been spending at least five months of every year in \nIndia, either with his family or on business related matters. \n \n \n11 ISCR Case No. 03-04147 at 3 (App. Bd. Nov. 4, 2005) (quoting ISCR Case No. 02-01093 at 4 (App. Bd. \nDec. 11, 2003). \n \n\n \n                                                                                                                                          \n \n10\nApplicant has substantial financial and business investments in both the United States and \nIndia. The company in India is owned and managed on paper by his wife, but in reality, \nApplicant controls and manages both the U.S. and Indian companies. Applicant transferred \nownership of two of his apartments in India to his wife. Notwithstanding, his wife\u2019s ownership \nof the company and the two apartments, he is so close to his wife and children that the divestiture \ndoes not insulate him from any possible conflict of interest, risk of foreign influence, or \nexploitation. Considering the totality of the facts and circumstances, including his background, \neducation, and business success, it is likely Indian authorities are aware of Applicant\u2019s contacts \nwith his family, in-laws, friends, professional associates, property, and business investments in \nIndia. \n \n \n\u201cBecause of the extreme sensitivity of security matters, there is a strong presumption \nagainst granting a security clearance. Whenever any doubt is raised . . .  it is deemed best to err \non the side of the government\u2019s compelling interest in security by denying or revoking [a] \nclearance.\u201d12 After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, all the facts and \ncircumstances, in the context of the whole person, I conclude he has not mitigated the foreign \ninfluence security concerns.  \n \n \nFORMAL FINDINGS \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:    \n AGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.h  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nDECISION \n \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue eligibility for a security clearance for \nApplicant.

He has failed to mitigate the security concerns raised under the financial\nconsiderations guideline. Applicant's eligibility for a security clearance is denied.\n\nThis action was taken under Executive Order 10865, dated February 20, 1960, as amended, and DoD Directive\n1\n5220.6, dated January 2, 1992, as amended and modified (Directive).\nThe government submitted eight items in support of its contentions.\n2\nItem 3 (Applicant\u2019s Answer to SOR, dated February 23, 2007) at 1-3.\n3\nItem 4 (Application for Security Clearance (SF 86), dated January 24, 2005) at 1-10.\n4\nId.\n5\nItem 3, supra note 3, at 1-2.\n6\nItem 6 (Credit Bureau Report, dated March 6, 2007) at 1-3.\n7\n2\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn January 30, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued Applicant\na Statement of Reasons (SOR) stating that it was unable to find that it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant or continue a security clearance.  The SOR, which is in essence the\n1\nadministrative complaint, alleged security concerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations)\nof the revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) issued on December 29, 2005, and implemented by the\nDepartment of Defense effective September 1, 2006. The revised guidelines were provided to\nApplicant when the SOR was issued.\nOn February 23, 2007, Applicant submitted a notarized response to the SOR, and elected to\nhave his case decided on the record in lieu of a hearing. Department Counsel submitted the\ngovernment\u2019s written case on March 28, 2007. Applicant received a complete file of relevant\nmaterial (FORM) on April 4, 2007, and was provided the opportunity to file objections and submit\nmaterial to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the government\u2019s case.  The case was assigned to me on\n2\nMay 22, 2007. Applicant did not submit additional information. \nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant admitted all allegations in his SOR response under Guideline F.

He received numerous\nrequests from creditors to discuss resolution of overdue accounts. However, Applicant did not\nrespond. Applicant provided no evidence of any mitigating conditions involving medical problems\nor other extenuating circumstances.8\nApplicant\u2019s monthly net income is $1,850. His spouse also works and earns $2,221. Thus,\nthe total monthly net income is $4,071. He has monthly expenses of $3,405, including a $397\nmonthly car loan. His monthly net remainder is $269. He lists no assets.9\nApplicant provided no information concerning his work record.10\nPOLICIES\nThe President has \u201cthe authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national\nsecurity and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position \u2026 that\nwill give that person access to such information.\u201d   In Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\n11\nClassified Information Within Industry (Feb. 20, 1960), the President set out guidelines and\nprocedures for safeguarding classified information and determining trustworthiness within the\nexecutive branch. \nTo be eligible for a security clearance or access to sensitive information, an applicant must\nmeet the security guidelines contained in the Directive.  The revised Adjudicative Guidelines set forth\npotentially disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) under each guideline.\nAdditionally, each security decision must be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based on the\nrelevant and material facts and circumstances, the whole-person concept, along with the adjudicative\nprocess factors listed in \u00b6 6.3 of the Directive, and AG \u00b6 2(a).\n\u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make\nan affirmative determination that the person is eligible for a security clearance.\u201d    An administrative\n12\njudge must apply the \u201cwhole person concept,\u201d and consider and carefully weigh the available, reliable\ninformation about the person.   An administrative judge should consider the following factors: (1)\n13\nthe nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to\ninclude knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the\npresence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for\n\n Id.\n14\n Directive, \u00b6 E3.1.14.\n15\n Directive, \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n16\n ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. December 19, 2002).\n17\n Directive, \u00b6 E2.2.2.\n18\nAG \u00b6 18.\n19\n4\nthe conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of\ncontinuation or recurrence.   \n14\nInitially, the Government must present evidence to establish controverted facts in the SOR that\ndisqualify or may disqualify the applicant from being eligible for access to classified information.15\nThereafter, the applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or\nmitigate the facts.  An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent\n16\nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d  Any doubt as to whether\n17\naccess to classified information is clearly consistent with national security will be resolved in favor\nof the national security.  The same rules apply to trustworthiness determinations for access to\n18\nsensitive positions.\nCONCLUSIONS\nI have carefully considered all the facts in evidence and the legal standards. The government\nhas established a prima facie case for disqualification under Guideline F of the revised Adjudicative\nGuidelines (AG) most pertinent to the evaluation of the facts in this case.\n \nGuideline F (Financial Considerations) The Concern: Failure or inability to live within one\u2019s\nmeans, satisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment,\nor unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an\nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. An individual who\nis financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.19\nIn this matter, the government provided substantial evidence that Applicant accrued 18\ndelinquent debts with an approximate total balance of $21,765. He admits they are still outstanding\ndebts. His 2007 credit report confirms the debt. Consequently, Financial Considerations Disqualifying\nConditions (FC DC) AG \u00b619(a) (inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts) and FC DC \u00b619 (c) (a\nhistory of not meeting financial obligations) apply. \nWith the government\u2019s case established, the burden shifts to Applicant to present evidence of\nrefutation, extenuation, or mitigation to overcome the case against him. I considered the Financial\nConsiderations Mitigating Condition (FC MC) AG \u00b620 (a), (the behavior happened so long ago, was\nso infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt\non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment). It does not apply because\n\n5\nhe still carries a significant amount of delinquent debt. One collection account is from 2001. Despite\nsteady employment, he has not made any payments on these debts. \nApplicant  provides no evidence or explanation concerning any mitigating conditions to support\nthe FC MC AG \u00b620 (b) (the conditions that resulted in the behavior were largely beyond the person's\ncontrol (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death,\ndivorce, or separation) and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstance).\nFC MC AG \u00b620 (c) (The person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/\nor there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or under control) does not apply. All\nof the debts remain outstanding. He has no structured plan to resolve these debts. Applicant's financial\nproblems remain.  It is unlikely they will be resolved in the near future.\nFC MC \u00b620(d) (The individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or\notherwise resolve debts) is not applicable. Applicant has not shown that he established a record of\nsteady payments or financial stability. He made no attempts to resolve the delinquent accounts. He did\nnot respond after receiving the SOR. Thus, I conclude that he did not make a good-faith effort to\nresolve his debts.\nThe issue before me is not whether Applicant is still legally liable for any or all of his\noutstanding debts, but whether he has presented sufficient evidence of extenuation, mitigating or\nchanged circumstances to warrant a favorable security determination. His remaining unpaid debt\nconstitutes a security concern.  He has been employed with his current employer since 2005. He lists\nhis wife\u2019s income on his personal financial statement, and his net monthly remainder could be used\nto pay toward the delinquent debt. However, he has chosen not to do that. This does raise a doubt about\nhis ability to resolve his outstanding debt. Applicant has not mitigated the government\u2019s concerns\nunder Guideline F.\nWhole Person\nIn all adjudications, the protection of our national security is the paramount concern. The\nobjective of the trustworthy determination process is the fair-minded, commonsense assessment of a\nperson\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the person is eligible for assignment to sensitive\nduties. Indeed, the adjudicative process is a careful weighing of a number of variables in considering\nthe \u201cwhole person\u201d concept. It recognizes that we should view a person by the totality of their acts,\nomissions, motivations and other variables. Each case must be adjudged on its own merits, taking into\nconsideration all relevant circumstances, and applying sound judgment, mature thinking, and careful\nanalysis.\nI have considered all the evidence and the \u201cwhole person\u201d in evaluating Applicant\u2019s security\nclearance determination.  Even an applicant with a good or even exemplary work history may engage\nin conduct that has negative implications or presents doubt about his judgment. Despite steady\nemployment, Applicant has accrued multiple delinquent accounts. It is not clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant Applicant a security clearance. Clearance is denied.\n.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\n\n6\nFormal Findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required\nby Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1.

Coacher, Esq., Department Counsel\nFO R  APPL IC A N T\nDavid P. Price, Esq.\nSYNOPSIS\n\nOn August 30, 2006, the Under Secretary of Defense (Intelligence) published a memorandum directing application of revised Adjudicative\n1\nGuidelines to all adjudications and other determinations made under the Directive and Department of Defense (DoD) Regulation 5200.2-R,\nPersonnel Security Program (Regulation), dated January 1987, as amended, in which the SOR was issued on or after September 1, 2006.\nFrom October 2005 until January 2007, Applicant had a relationship with an\nIndonesian woman, whom he met over the internet. He lived in Japan at the time.\nShe later moved to Japan. He has since terminated the relationship and returned to\nthe States. Applicant mitigated the security concerns pertaining to foreign influence.\nClearance is granted.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn January 22, 2004, Applicant submitted a Security Clearance Application\n(SF 86). On February 28, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to him, pursuant to Executive Order 10865,\nSafeguarding Classified Information Within Industry, dated February 20, 1960, as\namended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense\nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive), dated January\n2, 1992, as amended, modified and revised.  The SOR alleges security concerns\n1\nunder Guideline B (Foreign Influence). The SOR detailed reasons why DOHA could\nnot make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for him,\nand recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a\nclearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.\nIn an answer notarized on March 22, 2007, Applicant responded to the SOR\nallegations, and elected to have his case decided at a hearing. On April 30, 2007, the\ncase was assigned me. On May 15, 2007, a Notice of Hearing was issued setting the\nhearing for June 5, 2007. At the hearing the Government introduced two exhibits\ninto evidence that were marked Government Exhibits (GX) 1 and 2 and admitted into\nevidence without objection. Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AX), marked A through N, were\nintroduced without objection. The record was left open until June 12, 2007, to give\nApplicant an opportunity to submit additional information.  On June 12, 2007, that\ndeadline was extended to June 15, 2007, by order. DOHA received the hearing\ntranscript (Tr.) on June 13, 2007.  \nPROCEDURAL RULING\nDepartment Counsel requested administrative notice of the facts in\nGovernment Exhibits (GX) 3 through 12. Applicant did not object to me taking\nadministrative notice of those documents, as they relate to Indonesia and Japan. (Tr.\n7-8). \nAdministrative or official notice is the appropriate type of notice used for\nadministrative proceedings. See ISCR Case No. 05-11292 at 4 n.1 (App. Bd. Apr. 12,\n\n2007); ISCR Case No. 02-24875 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2006) (citing ISCR Case No.\n02-18668 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 10, 2004)); McLeod v. Immigration and Naturalization\nService, 802 F.2d 89, 93 n.4 (3d Cir. 1986)). The most common basis for\nadministrative notice at ISCR proceedings, is to notice facts that are either well\nknown or from government reports. See Stein, ADMINISTRATIVE LAW, Section 25.01\n(Bender & Co. 2006) (listing fifteen types of facts for administrative notice). I took\nadministrative notice of the facts under subheading \u201cIndonesia\u201d and \u201cJapan\u201d of this\ndecision, which are derived from GX 3 through 12. \nFINDINGS OF FACT \nAs to the SOR\u2019s factual allegations, Applicant admitted he had a romantic\nrelationship with a woman who is a citizen of Indonesia and a current resident of\nJapan. His admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a complete\nand thorough review of the evidence of record, I make the following findings of fact.\nApplicant is 39 years old. Having come from a family of military servicemen,\nhe enlisted in the Air Force after completing high school in 1986. He was a Senior\nAirman (E4) when he was honorably discharged in September 1992. (GX 2 at 5). He\nobtained a security clearance in 1987. (Tr. 20). \n \nIn 1987, Applicant was sent to Japan where he was on active duty for five\nyears. (Id.). While there he met his wife, a Japanese citizen, whom he married in\n1992. They have three children, ages 13, 9 and 6. (Tr. 22). After leaving the Air\nForce, he remained in Japan and taught English for a couple years.  From October\n1994 to October 1996, he worked as a computer technician at an air terminal. (Tr.\n28). He then worked for a federal contractor as a CADD database administrator for a\ncivil engineer squadron until January 2007, when he left Japan and returned to the\nStates. (Tr. 29). He did not have access to classified information in his former\nposition. (Tr. 57). In his present job, he does not have access to classified\ninformation, but will need a secret security clearance in order to work on classified\nnetworks in the future. (Tr. 57; 70). \nSometime in 2000, Applicant\u2019s relationship with his wife began to deteriorate,\nbecoming progressively strained by the middle of 2002. (Tr. 31-32). Over the next\ncouple years, many of his friends left Japan and he began feeling very lonely. (Tr.\n33).  In October 2005, he initiated communication over the internet with a woman\nwho was a citizen and resident of Indonesia. (Tr. 36). In February 2006, he flew to\nIndonesia for a few days to meet her. (Tr. 37). The next time he saw her was in April\n2006 in Japan after she accepted a position in a medical program there. (Tr. 39). The\nrelationship became romantic in September 2006 and continued until January 2007\nwhen he left Japan. (Tr. 39). In March 2007, he completely terminated the\nrelationship, after realizing that he needed to change his personal situation and\nlearning that his interaction with the woman could jeopardize his employment. (Tr.\n50; 63). He has not seen her since January 2007 and has not communicated with her\nsince March 2007. He has no intention of returning to Japan. (Tr. 46). None of the\nwoman\u2019s family members are connected to the Indonesian government. (Tr. 61).\n\nThe contents of the Indonesia section are from GX 3, 4 and 5.\n2\nCurrently, Applicant is separated from his wife and he intends to seek a\ndivorce. (Tr. 50). She and the children live in Japan. He speaks to his wife twice a\nmonth, but calls his children several times a week. (Tr. 46). He would like his\nchildren to live with him in the future. He told his wife about the relationship with\nthe Indonesian woman in October 2006. (Tr. 41). He also told his father. (Tr. 65).\n Applicant was very candid about his connections to foreign nationals and his\nrelationship with the Indonesian woman in the interrogatories he submitted to the\nGovernment in December 2006. (Tr. 51; GX 2). He is embarrassed by his actions and\nacknowledges the employment and personal problems that were created as a result of\nhis indiscretions. (Tr. 52; 54).  His expression of remorse was very credible.\nApplicant submitted 15 character letters from colleagues, friends and family,\nwho have known him over the years. All of them are supportive and speak highly of\nhis character, loyalty and trustworthiness. Some of them are aware that his security\nclearance has been detained because of his relationships to people in Japan. He\nwould disclose more details to his employer if necessary. (Tr. 69). One of his\ncolleagues, who also served in the military, has known Applicant since 2001 when\nthey worked together in Japan. He claims that Applicant \u201cis American to the core; I\nhave no reason to believe that his allegiance lies elsewhere.\u201d (AX E).    \nIndonesia  \n2\nIndonesia is a multi-party republic with approximately 245 million people.\nFor the first time in 2004, the citizens directly elected their president, in elections\nthat international observers determined were free and fair. Although the government\nhas been unable to address serious human rights abuses in the past, legislation\nsigned in 2005 has continued to yield significant legal and judicial improvements for\nthe nation, including the expansion of rights for a free press. Due to possibility of\nterrorist attacks directed at Americans or Westerns at any time in the country, the\nU.S. State Department has issued a travel warning concerning the security situation\nin Indonesia.\nJapan\n \nJapan is a stable parliamentary democracy with a generally good human rights\nrecord. It has been a strong ally of the United States since post-World War II.  The\ntwo countries share military alliances and economic partnerships.  It has offered the\nUnited States extensive support in the war on terror.  More recently, it launched an\nintelligence-gathering satellite and intends to establish an intelligence office in\n\nWashington, D.C. for purposes of sharing information with the U.S. Japan was listed\nin 2000 as an active collector of economic and proprietary information.\nPOLICIES\nIn an evaluation of an applicant\u2019s security suitability, an administrative judge\nmust consider the \u201cAdjudicative Guideline for Determining Eligibility For Access to\nClassified Information\u201d (Guidelines), which sets forth adjudicative guidelines. In\naddition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative\nguidelines are divided into Disqualifying Conditions (DC) and Mitigating Conditions\n(MC), which are used to determine an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified\ninformation.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible ironclad rules of law. Instead, recognizing\nthe complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge should apply these\nguidelines in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process.\nGuideline \u00b6 2. An administrative judge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair,\nimpartial and common sense decision. Because the entire process is a conscientious\nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person concept,\u201d an\nadministrative judge should consider all available, reliable information about the\nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. Guideline\n\u00b6 2(c).\nSpecifically, an administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative\nprocess factors listed at Guideline \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of\nthe conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which\nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential\nfor pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation\nor recurrence.\u201d\nSince the protection of the national security is the paramount consideration,\nthe final decision in each case is arrived at by applying the standard that \u201c[a]ny\ndoubt concerning personnel being considered for access to classified information\nwill be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d Guideline \u00b6 2(b). In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based\non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing\ninferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\n\n \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all\n3\nthe contrary evidence in the record.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1).  \u201cThis is something less\nthan the weight of the evidence, and the possibility of drawing two inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent [a Judge\u2019s] finding\nfrom being supported by substantial evidence.\u201d Consolo v. Federal Maritime Comm\u2019n, 383 U.S. 607, 620 (1966).  \u201cSubstantial\nevidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375,\n380 (4  Cir. 1994).\nt h\n\u201cThe Administrative Judge [considers] the record evidence as a whole, both favorable and unfavorable, evaluate[s] Applicant\u2019s past and\n4\ncurrent circumstances in light of pertinent provisions of the Directive, and decide[s] whether Applicant ha[s] met his burden of persuasion under\nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.15.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 04-10340 at 2 (App. Bd. July 6, 2006). \nIn the decision-making process, facts must be established by \u201csubstantial\nevidence.\u201d  The Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to\n3\nestablish a case which demonstrates, in accordance with the Directive, that it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s access\nto classified information. Once the Government has produced substantial evidence of\na disqualifying condition, the burden shifts to Applicant to produce evidence and\nprove a mitigating condition. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 provides, \u201cThe applicant is\nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and\n[applicant] has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable\nclearance decision.\u201d The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to\nthe Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).4\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. It is a\nrelationship that transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty\nhours as well. It is because of this special relationship the Government must be able\nto repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants\naccess to classified information. Decisions under this Directive include, by\nnecessity, consideration of the possible risk an applicant may deliberately or\ninadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified information. Such decisions\nentail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather\nthan actual, risk of compromise of classified information.\n \nThe scope of an administrative judge\u2019s decision is limited. Nothing in this\nDecision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole or\nin part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant\u2019s allegiance,\nloyalty, or patriotism.  Executive Order 10865, \u00a7 7. \nCONCLUSIONS\n\nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all\nappropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, including those described briefly\nabove, I conclude the following with respect to the allegations set forth in the SOR:\nForeign Influence\nGuideline \u00b6 6 explains the Government\u2019s concern about \u201cforeign contacts and\ninterests\u201d stating, \u201cif the individual has divided loyalties or foreign financial\ninterests, [he or she] may be manipulated or induced to help a foreign person, group,\norganization, or government in a way that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to\npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Adjudication under this Guideline can\nand should consider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact\nor financial interest is located, including, but not limited to, such considerations as\nwhether the foreign country is known to target United States citizens to obtain\nprotected information and/or is associated with a risk of terrorism.\u201d\nO ne  F o re ign In flu e n c e  D isq ua lifying C o n d itio n is p artic ula rly re le va nt and  m ay b e\ndisqualifying in this case. G uideline \u00b6 7(a) provides a disqualification when an  ind ivid ual has\n\u201cc o nta ct with a fo re ign fa m ily m em b e r, b usine ss o r p ro fe ssio na l asso c ia te , f rie n d , o r o the r p erso n\nw ho  is a c itiz e n  o f o r  re sid e nt in a fo re ign co untry if tha t co nta ct cre ate s a he ighte ne d  risk o f\nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion.\u201d App licant admitted that\nfo r over a year, he had  a relatio nship  with a wo m an, pe rso nally and o ver the internet, with a\nwom an w ho  w as a citizen and resident of Indonesia initially, and later a resident of Japan. B ased\no n that ad m issio n the G o vernm ent estab lished a d isqualificatio n.\nAfter the Government produced substantial evidence of the disqualifying\ncondition, the burden shifted to Applicant to produce evidence and prove a\nmitigating condition. Two Foreign Influence Mitigating Conditions under Guideline\n\u00b6 8 are potentially applicable:\n(a) the nature of the relatio nship s with fore ign  p e rso n s, the co untry in which these\np erso ns are lo cated , or the p o sitio ns o r activities of th o se  pe rso ns in that co untry\nare such that it is unlikely the ind ivid ual will be p laced  in a p o sition o f having to\nc ho o se  b e tw ee n the  inte re sts o f a fo re ig n  ind ivid ua l, gro up , o rga niz atio n, o r\ngo vernm ent and  the interests o f the U .S.; and\n(c ) c o ntact o r co mm unicatio n with fo reign citizens is so  casual and  infreq uent tha t\nthe re  is little  like liho o d  tha t it c o u ld  c r e ate  a  risk fo r fo re ign influe nc e o r\nexp lo itatio n.\nGiven Applicant\u2019s assertion that he has terminated the relationship with the Indonesian woman, \u201cit is unlikely [he]\nwill be placed in a position of having to choose between the interests of [the woman] and the interests of the U.S.\u201d Another\nrelevant factor in determining potential foreign influence is the nature of the government of the country in question. The\nwoman now resides in Japan, a strong military and economic ally of the United States. It has a good human rights record and is\nless likely to exert coercion on its citizens and residents. He is no longer in contact with her, which is sufficient to meet his\nburden of showing there is \u201clittle likelihood that [his relationship with her] could create a risk for foreign influence or\nexploitation.\u201d  Both conditions warrant application. \n \u201cWhole Person\u201d Analysis \nIn addition to the enumerated disqualifying and mitigating conditions as\ndiscussed previously, I have considered the general adjudicative guidelines related\n\n IS C R  C a s e  N o . 0 3 -0 4 1 4 7  at 3  (A p p .

Rather, the Judge must evaluate\nan applicant\u2019s security eligibility by considering the totality of an applicant\u2019s\nconduct and circumstances.\u201d  The directive lists nine adjudicative process factors\n5\n(APF) which are used for \u201cwhole person\u201d analysis.  Because foreign influence does\nnot involve misconduct, voluntariness of participation, rehabilitation and behavior\nchanges, etc., the eighth APF, \u201cthe potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress,\u201d Directive \u00b6 E2.2.1.8, is the most relevant of the nine APFs to this\nadjudication.  In addition to the eighth APF, other \u201c[a]vailable, reliable information\n6\nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be considered\nin reaching a determination.\u201d  Directive \u00b6 E2.2.1.  Ultimately, the clearance decision\nis \u201can overall common sense determination.\u201d  Directive \u00b6 E2.2.3.    \nThe Appeal Board requires the whole person analysis address \u201cevidence of an\napplicant\u2019s personal loyalties; the nature and extent of an applicant\u2019s family\u2019s ties to\nthe U.S. relative to his [or her] ties to a foreign country; his or her ties social ties\nwithin the U.S.; and many others raised by the facts of a given case.\u201d ISCR Case No.\n04-00540 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan. 5, 2007).  \nSubstantial mitigating evidence weighs towards grant of Applicant\u2019s security\nclearance. Applicant was born and educated in the United States. He has family\nliving here. He, along with several family members, has served in the U.S. military.\nIn January 2007, he returned home to reside and work. He would like his children to\nlive here in the future. He has no intention of returning to Japan to reside. He\nterminated his relationship with the Indonesian woman earlier this year, and\nunderstands the complications that it created in his personal and professional life.\nHe disclosed the relationship to his wife and father. His colleagues know that his\nsecurity clearance has been detained due to a foreign relationship.  He is willing to\nfurther disclose the relationship to his employer if necessary. These disclosures\ndiminish the potential for coercion by Japan. There is no evidence Applicant has\never taken any action which could cause potential harm to the United States. He\ntestified credibly that he takes his loyalty to the United States seriously, and he has\n\nSee ISCR Case No. 04-06242 at 2 (App. Bd. June 28, 2006). \n7\nworked diligently for a defense contractor for eleven years. His colleagues assess\nhim as loyal and trustworthy. \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, all the facts and\ncircumstances, in the context of the whole person, I conclude he has mitigated the\nsecurity concerns pertaining to foreign influence. The evidence leaves me with no\ndoubts as to Applicant\u2019s security eligibility and suitability.  \nI take this position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v.\nEgan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988), my \u201ccareful consideration of the whole person factors\u201d7\nand supporting evidence, my application of the pertinent factors under the\nAdjudicative Process, and my interpretation of my responsibilities under the\nGuidelines. Applicant has mitigated or overcome the Government\u2019s case. For the\nreasons stated, I conclude he is eligible for access to classified information.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the\nSOR, as required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:         \n Paragraph 1, Guideline B:  \nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue eligibility for a\nsecurity clearance for Applicant.

Items 2-5\nPOLICIES\n\n4\nAs Commander in Chief, the President has \u201cthe authority to . . . control access to information\nbearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to\noccupy a position . . . that will give that person access to such information.\u201d Department of the Navy\nv. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 527 (1988).  The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his\ndesignee to grant applicants eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that\nit is clearly consistent the national interest to do so.\u201d  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified\nInformation with Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960).  By direction of the Under Secretary of Defense for\nCounterintelligence and Security, adjudications of cases forwarded to DOHA by the Defense\nSecurity Service or the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) for a trustworthiness determination\nshall be conducted under the provisions of the Directive.  Eligibility for a position of trust is\npredicated upon the applicant meeting the guidelines contained in the Directive and a finding it is\nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so. See Directive \u00b6 2.3.  An applicant \u201chas the\nultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or\ncontinue his trustworthiness determination.\u201d See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15\nThe adjudication process is based on the whole person concept.  Enclosure 2 of the Directive\nsets forth personnel security guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating\nconditions (MC) under each guideline that must be carefully considered in making the overall\ncommon sense determination required.  The decision to deny an individual eligibility to occupy a\nposition of trust is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  See Exec. Or.\n10865 \u00a7 7.  It is merely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President\nand the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a such a determination.\nIn evaluating the trustworthiness of an applicant, the administrative judge must also assess\nthe adjudicative process factors listed in \u00b6 6.3 of the Directive.  Those assessments include:  (1) the\nnature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, and\nthe extent of knowledgeable participation; (3) how recent and frequent the behavior was; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6)\nthe presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood\nof continuation or recurrence (See Directive, Section E2.2.1. of Enclosure 2).  Because each case\npresents its own unique facts and circumstances, it should not be assumed that the factors exhaust\nthe realm of human experience or that the factors apply equally in every case.  Moreover, although\nadverse information concerning a single condition may not be sufficient for an unfavorable\ndetermination, the individual may be disqualified if available information reflects a recent or\nrecurring pattern of questionable judgment, irresponsibility, or other behavior specified in the\nGuidelines.\nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the personal\nor professional history of the applicant that disqualify, or may disqualify, the applicant from being\neligible to occupy a position of trust.  The Directive presumes a nexus or rational connection\nbetween proven conduct under any of the disqualifying conditions listed in the guidelines and an\napplicant\u2019s trustworthiness suitability.  See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).\nAll that is required is proof of facts and circumstances that indicate an applicant is at risk for\nmishandling classified information, or that an applicant does not demonstrate the high degree of\njudgment, reliability, or trustworthiness required of persons handling classified information.  ISCR\nCase No. 00-0277, 2001 DOHA LEXIS 335 at **6-8 (App. Bd. 2001).  Once the Government has\n\n5\nestablished a prima facie case by substantial evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut,\nexplain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  An applicant \u201chas the ultimate\nburden of demonstrating that is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his\ntrustworthiness determination. ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. 2002).  \u201cAny doubt as to\nwhether access to classified information is clearly consistent with national security will be resolved\nin favor of the national security.\u201d Directive \u00b6 E2.2.2\nBased upon a consideration of the evidence as a whole, I find the following adjudicative\nguideline most pertinent to an evaluation of the facts of this case:\nGuideline F: Financial Considerations: The Concern: Failure or inability to live within one\u2019s\nmeans, satisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment,\nor unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which could raise questions about an\nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information.  An individual\nwho is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.\nCompulsive gambling is a concern as it may lead to financial crimes including espionage.  Affluence\nthat cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a security concern.  It may indicate\nproceeds from financially profitable criminal acts.\n\u201cThe standard that must be met for . . . assignment to sensitive duties is that, based on all\navailable information, the person\u2019s loyalty, reliability, and trustworthiness are such that  . . .\nassigning the person to sensitive duties is clearly consistent with the interests of national security.\u201d\n(Regulation \u00b6 C6.1.1.1)  Appendix 8 of the Regulation sets forth the adjudicative policy, as well as\nthe disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) associated with each guideline.\nDoD contractor personnel are afforded the adjudication procedures contained in the Directive.\n(Regulation \u00b6 C8.2.1)\nCONCLUSIONS\nGuideline F: Applicant owes $32,674 in delinquent debts.  The only debts he is repaying are\nthree education loans by garnishment.  He is not voluntarily repaying those debts.  Applicant claimed\nhe put some debts into a debt consolidation program, but did not submit any documents to support\nhis assertion.  The disqualifying conditions applicable are Financial Considerations Disqualifying\nCondition \u00b619.a. (inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts), \u00b619.b. (indebtedness caused by\nfrivolous or irresponsible spending and the absence of any evidence of willingness or intent to pay\nthe debt or establish a realistic plan to pay the debt), and \u00b619.c. (a history of not meeting financial\nobligations).\nApplicant has done nothing to dispute, pay, or resolve these delinquent debts.  Nor are there\nany conditions beyond his control that explain or excuse his failure to repay these debts.  Therefore,\nno mitigating conditions in \u00b620 of Guideline F can be applied.\nWhole Person Analysis  \u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period\nof a person\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the person is eligible for a\u201d\ntrustworthiness decision.  Directive E2.2.1.  \u201cAvailable, reliable information about the person, past\nand present, favorable and unfavorable, should be considered in reaching a determination.\u201d Id.  In\n\n6\nevaluating Applicant\u2019s case, I have considered the adjudicative process factors listed in the Directive\n\u00b6E2.2.1.\nConsidering the criteria of the \u201cwhole person concept,\u201d I conclude the nature of Applicant\u2019s\ndebt problem, the extent or magnitude of his debt for a person only 28 years old, and the lack of\nefforts he has made to repay the seven debts under $500 to be a serious lack of attention to his\nfinancial responsibilities.  He knowingly and voluntarily accumulated these debts without sufficient\nincome to repay them while unemployed or in college.  There is no rehabilitation, or behavioral\nchange in Applicant\u2019s conduct toward his financial responsibilities and debts.  The magnitude of\nthese debts makes Applicant a potential target for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress, and he\nis likely to continue his attitude toward his obligations to repay his debts based on his past\nperformance.  His failure to manage responsibly his finances indicates poor judgment.\nI conclude the financial considerations trustworthiness concern against Applicant.  I also\nconclude the \u201cwhole person concept\u201d against Applicant.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nThe following are my conclusions as to each allegation in the SOR:\nParagraph 1.  Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a. to 1.r:\nAgainst Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for assignment to sensitive duties.\nHis application for eligibility for an ADP I/II/III position is denied.\nPhilip S.

Applicant\nrequested a hearing.  On July 18, 2007, after considering the record, Administrative Judge\nChristopher Graham denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant filed a timely\nappeal pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s application of the\nrelevant mitigating conditions is arbitrary, capricious, and contrary to law; and whether the Judge\u2019s\nwhole person analysis is arbitrary, capricious, and contrary to law.  Finding error, we remand the\ndecision to the Judge.\nWhether the Record Supports the Judge\u2019s Factual Findings\nA.  The Judge made the following pertinent findings of fact: \nApplicant immigrated to the U.S. as a child, becoming a U.S. citizen in 2000.  Applicant\u2019s\nfather is a citizen and resident of China (PRC).  Applicant\u2019s mother is also a citizen of the PRC,\nliving with Applicant\u2019s sister in the U.S.  Applicant\u2019s parents-in-law are PRC citizens, living with\nApplicant and her husband in the U.S.  About once a month, Applicant\u2019s mother-in-law telephones\nsome of her relatives in the PRC.  \nThe PRC has a poor human rights record.

In evaluating the Administrative\nJudge\u2019s findings, we are required to give deference to the Administrative Judge\u2019s credibility\ndeterminations.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1.\nApplicant has not challenged the Administrative Judge\u2019s factual findings.  Rather, Applicant\nclaims error regarding the Judge\u2019s conclusions, more specifically, his approach to the various\nmitigating factors provided under Guideline B.  Therefore, the Board will address the arguments\nraised on appeal by Applicant in the context of determining whether the record supports the Judge\u2019s\nultimate conclusions. \nWhether the Record Supports the Judge\u2019s Ultimate Conclusions\nAn Administrative Judge is required to \u201cexamine the relevant data and articulate a\nsatisfactory explanation for\u201d the decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the facts found\nand the choice made.\u2019\u201d Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n of the United States v. State Farm Mut. Auto Ins.\nCo., 463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983) (quoting Burlington Truck Lines, Inc. v. United States, 371 U.S. 156,\n\n\u201c[T]he nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which these persons are located, or the\n1\npositions or activities of those persons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a position\nof having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, group, organization, or government and the interests\nof the United States.\u201d\n\u201c[T]here is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of loyalty or obligation to the foreign\n2\nperson, group, government, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships and\nloyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest.\u201d\n3\n168 (1962)).  The Appeal Board may reverse the Administrative Judge\u2019s decision to grant, deny, or\nrevoke a security clearance if it is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.3. We\nreview matters of law de novo.\nAn important preliminary matter in this case involves the version of DoD Directive 5220.6\nthat was in effect at the time the case went to hearing.  As noted in a preceding paragraph, the SOR\nin this case issued on December 19, 2006.  The current version of DoD Directive 5220.6, which\ncontains the Revised Adjudicative Guidelines implemented for the Department of Defense by the\nUndersecretary of Defense for Intelligence on August 30, 2006, were made effective for any\nadjudication in which a Statement of Reasons issued on or after September 1, 2006.  Thus, the\ncurrent Adjudicative Guidelines apply to this case.\nThe Judge concluded that Applicant\u2019s PRC relatives could be a means through which\nApplicant could come to the attention of the PRC government and, therefore, could become a means\nthrough which Applicant could be pressured to compromise classified information.  The Judge\nconcluded that, given the record evidence, Applicant had not met her burden of persuasion that it is\n\u201c\u2018clearly consistent with the interests of national security\u2019\u201d for her to have a clearance.  More\nspecifically, the Judge stated that none of the mitigating conditions listed under paragraph 8 of the\nAdjudicative Guidelines (which comprise the mitigating conditions under Guideline B) applied to\nthe case.  The Judge went on to state: \u201cUnder the previous guidelines, the Appeal Board interpreted\nsimilar language to \u00b6 8 (a)  (footnote added) as establishing an absolute standard; i.e., an applicant\n1\nmust affirmatively prove that there is no possibility that anyone might attempt to exploit or influence\na foreign relative or acquaintance in the future.\u201d  This statement was accompanied by a supporting\nfootnote containing citations to Appeal Board cases decided under the version of DoD Directive\n5220.6 that was in effect prior to September 1, 2006.  Although the Judge discussed other factors in\nhis conclusions, the statement comprises a significant portion of the Judge\u2019s analysis in this case on\nthe issue of whether or not the mitigating conditions listed under paragraph 8 of the Revised\nGuidelines applied to Applicant\u2019s situation. \nOn appeal, Applicant makes a number of assertions regarding the Judge\u2019s conclusion that\nnone of the Guideline B mitigating conditions applied.  One such argument is particularly germane\nto the Board\u2019s resolution of this case.  Applicant claims the Judge disregarded the possible\napplication of Guideline B Mitigating Condition 8(b)  when deciding his case.  Her argument has\n2\nmerit.  While the Judge\u2019s decision states in its own terms that he considered Mitigating Condition\n8(b), because he relied, in part, on language and cases emanating from Adjudicative Guidelines that\nare no longer in force, the Judge erred by effectively precluding consideration of Applicant\u2019s case\nunder both current Mitigating Conditions 8(a) and 8(b).  As the Board can determine an appropriate\ndisposition of this case on this issue alone, it need not address other arguments raised by Applicant\non appeal.\n\n\u201cA determination that the immediate family member(s), (spouse, father, mother, sons, daughters, brothers,\n3\nsisters), cohabitant, or associate(s) in question are not agents of a foreign power or in a position to be exploited by a\nforeign power in a way that could force the individual to choose between loyalty to the person(s) involved and the United\nStates.\u201d \n4\n     \nThe validity of Appeal Board precedent issued under earlier editions of the Adjudicative\nGuidelines is an issue in this case.  The Board has previously held \u201c. . . a Judge cannot rely on\nlanguage from an earlier version of the Directive to justify the Judge\u2019s decision and that an\napplicant\u2019s security eligibility must be adjudicated under current DoD policies and standards, not\npast ones. Similarly, the precedential value of Board decisions is affected to the extent those\ndecisions involve the interpretation of a provision of the Directive that is later revised or changed.\nStatements made by the Board in earlier decisions that are predicated on then-existing language in\nthe Directive cannot be simply assumed \u2014by a Judge or a party\u2014 to be applicable in later cases after\nthe pertinent provision(s) of the Directive have been revised or changed.\u201d See ISCR Case No. 02-\n17369 at 3-4 (App. Bd. May 23, 2006); and ISCR Case No. 02-24254 at 7-8 (App. Bd. Jun 29, 2004)\n(footnotes omitted).  Of course, some precedent remains completely valid in the face of changes to\nthe guidelines, because it is not dependent on the language of any specific guideline.  Other\nprecedent remains valid where the applicable language of the guideline is unchanged or the changes\nare not of sufficient magnitude to vitiate or overrule  the substance of the precedent.  However,\nBoard decisions cannot be relied on or followed to the extent they involve precedent predicated on\nlaw or DoD policy that changed after the issuance of those decisions. Quasi-judicial adjudications\nmust be made within the bounds of applicable law and agency policy, not without regard to them.\nSee, e.g., Croplife America v. Environmental Protection Agency, 329 F.3d 876, 882 (D.C. Cir. 2003)\n(administrative law judges cannot ignore agency policy in making rulings); Nash v. Bowen, 869 F.2d\n675, 680 (2d Cir. 1989)(administrative law judge is subordinate to head of agency or department in\nmatters of policy); Mullen v. Bowen, 800 F.2d 535, 540 n. 5 (6th Cir. 1986) (decisional independence\ndoes not relieve administrative law judge of the obligation to apply agency policy).  See  ISCR Case\nNo. 02-00305 at  3 (App. Bd. Feb. 12, 2003)(security clearance decisions must be based on current\nDoD policy and standards). Accordingly, no Board decision should be construed or interpreted\nwithout regard to the law and DoD policy applicable at the time the Board decision was issued.\nRegarding Guideline B, the Revised Adjudicative Guidelines that took effect on September\n1, 2006 brought with them significant changes in the language of both the disqualifying and the\nmitigating conditions.  In this case, the Judge\u2019s use of the word \u201csimilar\u201d to describe the relationship\nbetween the language of the old Guideline B Mitigating Condition 1  and the current Mitigating\n3\nCondition 8(a) is clearly erroneous.  While the basic concepts underlying the prior and the current\nmitigating conditions are related, a comparison of the language between the two reveals considerable\ndifferences.  Not the least of these is the appearance of the qualifying term \u201cunlikely\u201d in the current\nversion, whereas the earlier mitigating Condition 1 contained no such proviso.  In the face of these\ndifferences, it was error for the Judge to assume that the viability of the Board\u2019s prior interpretation\nof the language of the earlier Mitigating Condition 1 has continued, with unaltered effect, in the face\nof the new language of Mitigating Condition 8(a).  Additionally, Mitigating Condition 8(b) under\nthe current Guidelines, the application of which is of particular interest to Applicant on appeal, has\nno counterpart under the previous Guidelines, and it can act to provide mitigation in appropriate\ncases even when the provisions of Mitigating Condition 8(a) are not satisfied.  By largely relying\nupon his perception of the Board\u2019s interpretation of the language of prior Mitigating Condition 1,\n\n5\nand his treatment of that interpretation as dispositive, the Judge effectively precluded proper\nconsideration of the Applicant\u2019s case under current Mitigating Condition 8(b).  \nIn addition to the matters discussed in the previous paragraph, the Judge\u2019s preoccupation with\nsuch terms as \u201cimmediate family members\u201d and \u201cagents of a foreign power\u201d in other parts of his\nconclusions section leave little doubt that his analysis of the case was substantially rooted in a\nconsideration of the language of prior Adjudicative Guidelines and his understanding of precedent\ndeveloped thereunder, rather than the current Guidelines.  While there are parts of his analysis of the\ncase that do not suffer from this infirmity, the Board concludes that there is a strong possibility that\nthe Judge\u2019s error precluded an adjudication under the current guidelines.  Therefore, the case is\nremanded to the Judge for the issuing of a new decision in accordance with the matters discussed by\nthe Board herein. \n\n6\n         \nOrder\nThe Judge\u2019s adverse security clearance decision is REMANDED.\nSigned: Michael Y.

Because the\nentire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person\nconcept,\u201d an administrative judge should consider all available, reliable information about the\nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.23\nSpecifically, an administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors\nlisted at Guidelines \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency\nand recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5)\nextent to which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d\nSince the protection of the national security is the paramount consideration, the final decision\nin each case is arrived at by applying the standard that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being\nconsidered for access to classified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d   In\n24\nreaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based\non the evidence contained in the record.  Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on\nmere speculation or conjecture.\n\n\u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might  accept as adequate to support a\n25\nconclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the record.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006)\n(citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1).  \u201cThis is something less than the weight of the evidence, and the possibility of drawing\ntwo inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent [a Judge\u2019s] finding from being supported by substantial\nevidence.\u201d  Consolo v. Federal Maritime Comm\u2019n, 383 U.S. 607, 620 (1966).  \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a\nscintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4  Cir. 1994).\nth\nSee ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  The Administrative Judge considers the record evidence\n26\n \nas a whole, both favorable and unfavorable, evaluate[s] Applicant\u2019s past and current circumstances in light of pertinent\nprovisions of the Directive, and decide[s] whether Applicant ha[s] met his burden of persuasion under Directive \u00b6\nE3.1.15.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 04-10340 at 2 (App. Bd. July 6, 2006). \nExecutive Order 10865, \u00a7 7. \n27\n6\nIn the decision-making process, facts must be established by \u201csubstantial evidence.\u201d   The\n25\nGovernment initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish a case which demonstrates,\nin accordance with the Directive, that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant\nor continue an applicant\u2019s access to classified information.  Once the government has produced\nsubstantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, the burden shifts to Applicant to produce evidence\nand prove a mitigating condition.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 provides, \u201cThe applicant is responsible for\npresenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by\napplicant or proven by Department Counsel, and [applicant] has the ultimate burden of persuasion\nas to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  The burden of disproving a mitigating condition\nnever shifts to the government.26\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with\nthe government predicated upon trust and confidence.  It is a relationship that transcends normal duty\nhours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well.  It is because of this special relationship the\ngovernment must be able to repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to\nwhom it grants access to classified information.  Decisions under this Directive and the guidelines\ninclude, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or\ninadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain\ndegree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nThe scope of an administrative judge\u2019s decision is limited.  Nothing in this decision should\nbe construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole or in part, on any express or implied\ndetermination as to Applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or patriotism.  \n27\nCONCLUSIONS\nGuidelines \u00b6 6. The Concern. Foreign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the\nindividual has divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or induced to help\na foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way that is not in U.S. interests, or is\nvulnerable to pressure or coercion by any foreign interest.  Adjudication under this Guideline can\nand should consider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or financial\n\nISCR Case No.  99-0424, 2001 DOHA LEXIS at 33-34 (App.  Bd.  Feb.  8, 2001).\n28\nId.\n29\n7\ninterest is located, including, but not limited to, such considerations as whether the foreign country\nis known to target United States citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with\na risk of terrorism.\nGuidelines \u00b6 7. Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying\ninclude:\n(a) contact with a foreign family member, business or professional associate, friend, or other\nperson who is a citizen of or resident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of\nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and\n(d) sharing living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of citizenship status, if that\nrelationship creates a heightened risk of foreign inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion.\nThe term \u201cimmediate family members\u201d has been defined to include a spouse, father, mother,\nsons, daughters, brothers, and sisters.  Applicant\u2019s father and her mother in law\u2019s relatives live in and\nare citizens of China.  This \u201ccould create the potential for foreign influence that could result in the\ncompromise of classified information.  The mere possession of family ties with a person in a foreign\ncountry is not, as a matter of law, disqualifying under Guideline B.\u201d   However, such ties do raise\n28\na prima facie security concern sufficient to require an applicant to present evidence of rebuttal,\nextenuation, or mitigation sufficient to meet the applicant\u2019s burden of persuasion that it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for her.   \n29\nAlthough the definition of family member does not include in-laws, the appeal board has\nopined that it includes a rebuttable presumption that a person has ties of affection for, or obligation\nto, the immediate family members of the person\u2019s spouse.  See ISCR Case No.02-31154 at 4, fn.4\n(citing ISCR Case No. 01-03120 (App. Bd. Feb. 20, 2002) (App. Bd. Sept. 25, 2005).  Applicant\u2019s\nmother-in-law has immediate family in China, with whom she has regular contact.  In light of the\nAppeal Board\u2019s decision, Applicant\u2019s mother-in-law may also pose a security risk because of her\nfamily\u2019s residence or citizenship or both.\nGuidelines \u00b6 8. Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include:\n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which these persons\nare located, or the positions or activities of those persons in that country are such that it is unlikely\nthe individual will be placed in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign\nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the U.S.;\n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual's sense of loyalty or obligation\nto the foreign person, group, government, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep\nand longstanding relationships and loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to\nresolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest; and\n\nSee 50 U.S.C. \u00a71801 (a) (5) and (6).\n30\nThe Appeal Board has determined that contacts with relatives living in a foreign country must be both casual and\n31\ninfrequent. See ISCR Case No. 04-12500 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006).  Moreover, contacts with such family members\nare presumed to be \u201cnot casual.\u201d Id.  In the analysis of countervailing evidence, it is legal error to give significant weight\nto any of the following facts or factors: applicant\u2019s ties to the United States (ISCR Case No. 02-13595 at 5 (App. Bd.\nMay 10, 2005)); lack of prominence of relatives living in the foreign country (Id.); \u201cfamily members\u2019 low-key and\nnoncontroversial lifestyle, and the fact that the foreign country\u2019s government has not contacted them about Applicant\u201d\n(ISCR Case No. 04-12500 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006)); one relative living in foreign country is sufficient to negate\nFI MC 1 (ISCR Case No. 03-02382 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 15, 2006)); a foreign relative\u2019s fragile health (ISCR Case No.\n02-29403 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 14, 2004)), advanced age (ISCR Case No. 02-00305 at 7 (App. Bd. Feb. 12, 2003)),\nfinancial independence (ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 6 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005)), or lack of financial dependency upon\nApplicant (ISCR Case No. 03-15205 at 4 (App. Bd. Jan 21, 2005)); foreign relatives spend part of each year in the U.S.\n(ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 6 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005)); the lack of any connection between the foreign relative and\nthe foreign government in question (ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 6 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005)); the absence of any attempt\nat exploitation in the past (ISCR Case No. 03-15205 at 4 (App. Bd. Jan. 21, 2005)); a foreign country\u2019s friendly\nrelationship with the U.S., its stable, democratic government, or its extensive foreign military agreements with the U.S.\n(ISCR Case No. 02-22461 at 5-6 (App. Bd. Oct. 27, 2005)).\n8\n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and infrequent that there is\nlittle likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign influence or exploitation.\nApplicant admitted that her father lived in China, and that her husband\u2019s parents lived with\nthem.  Based on the record as a whole, the government established its case under the Guidelines.\nApplicant has close family ties to the PRC, as evidenced by her father, and her mother-in-law\u2019s\nrelatives living in China.  The strength of the ties is also demonstrated by Applicant traveling to the\nPRC to visit her father, and the phone calls she makes to him.  Her mother-in-law frequently calls\nher relatives from Applicant\u2019s home phone.  Her father-in-law made a recent trip to China.  These\ncircumstances raise security concerns under Guidelines \u00b6\u00b6 7(a) and (d).\nI reviewed the mitigating conditions under Guidelines \u00b6 8 and conclude none apply.  It\nappears that none of the family members in PRC are agents of the PRC government or any other\nforeign power.  The term \u201cforeign power\u201d includes political parties and entities controlled by the\ngovernment.   But that does not end the analysis, as Applicant must show her family members in\n30\nthe PRC are not in positions to be exploited by the PRC government.  Given China\u2019s human rights\nrecord, Applicant\u2019s family members could easily be exploited by the PRC government. \nUnder the previous guidelines, the Appeal Board interpreted similar language to \u00b6 8 (a) as\nestablishing an absolute standard; i.e., an applicant must affirmatively prove that there is no\npossibility that anyone might attempt to exploit or influence a foreign relative or acquaintance in the\nfuture.  See ISCR Case No. 03-17620 at 4 (App.  Bd. Apr. 17, 2006) (the mitigating condition\n\u201cwhich does not apply because, as is well settled, it requires that Applicant demonstrate that his\nrelatives are not in a position which could force Applicant to choose between his loyalty to them, and\nhis loyalty to the United States.\u201d); ISCR Case No. 03-02382 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb.15, 2005).31\nIn deciding if an applicant has met her burden, it is proper to consider how the foreign\ncountry at issue is governed.  The focus is not the country or its people, but its rulers and the nature\nof the government they impose.  The PRC is hostile to the U.S. and is ruled by a communist\ngovernment with a poor record of human rights.  With this history it is not difficult to envision a\nscenario in which China exploits her father or her mother-in-law\u2019s family members, to put pressure\n\n9\non Applicant or her husband to force her to compromise classified information.  We also know the\nPRC is actively pursuing industrial and military intelligence in this country.  Given these\ncircumstances--which are clearly beyond Applicant's control--the presence of Applicant's father and\nher mother-in-law\u2019s relatives in the PRC places them at risk of being brought under control or used\nas a hostage by a PRC intelligence or security service.  Unfortunately, they are in a position where\nthere is a potential for them to be exploited in a way that could force Applicant to choose between\nloyalty to her family members and the interests of the U.S.  Accordingly, Applicant is unable to\nsuccessfully mitigate the security concern, and Guideline B is decided against her.\nTo conclude, Applicant has failed to meet her ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a\nfavorable clearance decision.  But this decision should not be construed as an indictment of\nApplicant's loyalty and patriotism to the U.S., as those matters are not at issue.  Instead, the clearly-\nconsistent standard requires I resolve any doubt against Applicant, and her close family ties to the\nPRC create doubt about her security suitability.  In reaching my decision, I have considered the\nrecord evidence as a whole, the whole-person concept, the clearly-consistent standard, and the\nappropriate factors and guidelines in the Directive.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required\nby E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1.

As required by Executive Order 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information Within Industry, dated February 20, 1960, as \namended, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended, \nDOHA issued an Amended Statement of Reasons (SOR) on December 19, 2006, \ndetailing the basis for its decision \u2013 security concerns raised under Guideline B (Foreign \nInfluence) of the Directive. The President issued revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) on \nDecember 30, 2005. DoD implemented them on September 1, 2006.  Pending official \namendment/reissue of DoD Directive 5220.6, the AG are to be used in all cases when \nthe SOR is dated on or after September 1, 2006.  Because the SOR was issued after \nSeptember 1, 2006, DoD policy requires that this case proceed under the revised \nguidelines.  \n \n1 \n \n \n                                                          \n1 Government Exhibit 1 (Security Clearance Application, dated September 27, 2005). \nJanuary 9, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \n \n                                                          \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on December 29, 2006, and elected to \nhave a hearing before an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on \nFebruary 23, 2007, and a Notice of Hearing was issued on March 6, 2007.  I convened \na hearing on March 30, 2007, to consider whether it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue Applicant's security clearance. The government \noffered eight exhibits, marked as Exhibits 1-8. Applicant offered no exhibits. All exhibits \nwere admitted without objection.  DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on April 11, 2007. \n \nI issued a decision on July 18, 2007. The Applicant appealed. The Appeal Board \nremanded the case on November 14, 2007. \n \nAppellate Issues \n \nThe Appeal Board determined that the facts cited in my decision were supported \nby substantial evidence.2 It also found that my conclusions under Guideline B were \npotentially erroneous because I used language from prior Appeal Board decisions that \nwere based on the previous adjudicative guidelines that have been replaced.   \nApplicant\u2019s case is required to be adjudicated under the revised Adjudicative Guidelines \n(AG), which are effective for all statements of reasons (SOR) issued on or after \nSeptember 1, 2006.     \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant admitted the allegations contained in the SOR.  The admissions are \nincorporated herein as findings of fact.  After a complete and thorough review of the \nevidence in the record, and upon due consideration of same, I make the following \nadditional findings of fact:  \n \nApplicant is a 32-year-old software engineer employed by a defense contractor. \n(Tr. 11, 14). She is married with one child. (Tr. 12). She has a bachelor\u2019s degree in \ninformation systems, and anticipated being awarded a master\u2019s degree in computer \nscience in December 2007. (Tr. 12). She has no prior military service and this is her first \napplication for a security clearance. (Tr. 13).  Applicant immigrated to the United States \nwhen she was ten years old.  She became a citizen in 2000. (Tr. 19).   \n \nApplicant\u2019s mother lives in the United States, and her father is a citizen and \nresident of China. He resided in the United States from 1986 to 1993 or 1994. When her \nparents divorced, her father returned to China. (Tr. 14-15, 19). Her mother lives in the \nUnited States with Applicant\u2019s sister. Her mother has not become a citizen primarily \nbecause she speaks no English. (Tr. 16). Applicant talks with her father 3-4 times per \nyear. Her grandfather lives in a nursing home in the United States. She keeps her father \nadvised of her grandfather\u2019s condition. (Tr. 16). Her father is retired, and has never \nserved in the military, or been employed by the Chinese government. (Tr. 29-30).  \n \n \n2 ISCR Case No. 06-23435 at 2 (App. Bd. Nov. 14, 2007). \n\n \n3 \n \n \n                                                          \nApplicant has substantial financial connections to the United States.  She owns a \nhome in the United States, and she has a U.S. 401(k).  She also has a U.S. checking \nand savings account.  She does not own property in China. (Tr. 19-23).  \n \nApplicant traveled to China in 2001, where she saw her father and visited several \nareas she had not seen before. (Tr. 18).  Her Chinese passport expired in 1996 and has \nnot been renewed. (Tr. 27). \n \nApplicant\u2019s husband works for a defense contractor, but does not have a security \nclearance. (Tr. 23, 37). Her father-in-law and mother-in-law are Chinese citizens living \nwith Applicant and her husband in the U.S. His father-in-law\u2019s entire family lives in the \nU.S. (Tr. 32). His mother-in-law has immediate family living in China. They have applied \ntwice for citizenship but have been unable to master the language test. (Tr. 32). About \nonce per month, her mother-in-law calls some of her relatives in China, using \nApplicant\u2019s home phone. (Tr. 37). Her father-in-law traveled to China in the last three \nyears for a vacation. (Tr. 40-41). \n \nPeoples Republic of China \n \n \nThe PRC has an abysmal human rights record, which includes arbitrary killings; \ndetention or incarceration without notice in mental facilities; torture; arbitrary arrest, \ndetention or exile; no right to a public, fair trial; and no rights of privacy - family, home or \ncorrespondence.3 China engages in espionage against the United States and is \nbelieved to have plans for a \u201ccyber attack\u201d on U.S. computer systems.4 \u201cThe PRC also \ntries to identify ethnic Chinese in the United States who have access to sensitive \ninformation, and sometimes is able to enlist their cooperation in illegal technology or \ninformation transfers.\u201d5 The PRC has had success in obtaining classified defense \ninformation.6  \n \nPolicies \n \nIn an evaluation of an applicant\u2019s security suitability, an administrative judge must \nconsider the \u201cAdjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility For Access to Classified \nInformation\u201d (AG).  In addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the \nguidelines are divided into disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are \nused to determine an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \n \n3 Government Exhibit 3 (U. S.  State Department, Country Reports on Human Rights Practices: China, \n2005, dated March 8, 2006) at 1, 4-17.  \n \n4 Government Exhibit 9 (Report of the Select Committee on U. S. National Security and \nMilitary/Commercial Concerns with the People\u2019s Republic of China, May 1999,) at 19-21. \n \n5 Id. at 21. \n \n6 Government Exhibit 8 (Annual Report to Congress on Foreign Economic Collection and Industrial \nEspionage for 2006, at 15-16. \n\n \n4 \n \n \n                                                          \nThese guidelines are not inflexible ironclad rules of law.  Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, an administrative judge should apply these guidelines \nin conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. AG \u00b6 2. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common \nsense decision.  Because the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of \nvariables known as the \u201cwhole person concept,\u201d an administrative judge should consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. AG \u00b6 2(c). \n \nSpecifically, an administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative \nprocess factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the \nconduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and \nmaturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) the \npresence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the \nmotivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d \n \nSince the protection of the national security is the paramount consideration, the \nfinal decision in each case is arrived at by applying the standard that \u201c[a]ny doubt \nconcerning personnel being considered for access to classified information will be \nresolved in favor of national security.\u201d AG \u00b6 2(b). In reaching this decision, I have drawn \nonly those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \n \nIn the decision-making process, facts must be established by \u201csubstantial \nevidence.\u201d7 The Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish \na case which demonstrates, in accordance with the Directive, that it is not clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s access to \nclassified information. Once the government has produced substantial evidence of a \ndisqualifying condition, the burden shifts to Applicant to produce evidence and prove a \nmitigating condition. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 provides, \u201cThe applicant is responsible for \npresenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts \nadmitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and [applicant] has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d The \nburden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the government.8 \n \n7\u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might  accept as adequate to \nsupport a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the record.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 \n(App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1). \u201cThis is something less than the weight of the \nevidence, and the possibility of drawing two inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent \n[a Judge\u2019s] finding from being supported by substantial evidence.\u201d Consolo v. Federal Maritime Comm\u2019n, \n383 U.S. 607, 620 (1966). \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  \nSee v. Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994).  \n \n8See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \u201cThe Administrative Judge considers the \nrecord evidence as a whole, both favorable and unfavorable, evaluate[s] Applicant\u2019s past and current \n\n \n5 \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                          \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. It is a \nrelationship that transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours \nas well. It is because of this special relationship the government must be able to repose \na high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions under this Directive and the guidelines include, by \nnecessity, consideration of the possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or \ninadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a \ncertain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk \nof compromise of classified information. \n  \nThe scope of an administrative judge\u2019s decision is limited. Nothing in this \ndecision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole or in \npart, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or \npatriotism. Executive Order 10865, \u00a7 7.  \n \nAnalysis \n \nAG \u00b6 6 expresses the security concern involving foreign influence: \n \nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual \nhas divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by \nany foreign interest.  Adjudication under this Guideline can and should \nconsider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or \nfinancial interest is located, including, but not limited to, such \nconsiderations as whether the foreign country is known to target United \nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a \nrisk of terrorism. \n \nAG \u00b6 7 describes nine conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying; however, three conditions are potentially disqualifying in this case: \n \n(a) contact with a foreign family member, business or professional \nassociate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a \nforeign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign \nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion;  \n \n \ncircumstances in light of pertinent provisions of the Directive, and decide[s] whether Applicant ha[s] met \nhis burden of persuasion under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.\u201d ISCR Case No. 04-10340 at 2 (App. Bd. July 6, \n2006).  \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \n                                                          \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to \nprotect sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s desire to \nhelp a foreign person, group, or country by providing that information; and  \n \n(d) sharing living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of \ncitizenship status, if that relationship creates a heightened risk of foreign \ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion. \n \n \n \nAlthough the term \u201cfamily member\u201d is not defined in AG \u00b6 7(a), I conclude family \nmember includes in-laws because Applicant has ties of affection for, or obligation to, her \nin-laws.9   \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s father lives in and is a resident of PRC.  She has direct contact with \nher father 3-4 times per year.  She also traveled to China in 2001 and visited her father.  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s mother-in-law is a PRC citizen and lives with Applicant.  Her mother-\nin-law communicates with her relatives, who live in PRC and who are citizens of PRC. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s relationships with her mother-in-law and her father \u201ccreate a potential \nfor conflict of interest\u201d because Applicant may have a desire to help her father and her \nmother-in-law\u2019s family members by providing classified information. Because she \nshares living quarters with her mother-in-law there is a heightened risk of foreign \ninducement or pressure.   \n \n \nThe mere possession of family ties with a person in a foreign country is not, as a \nmatter of law, disqualifying under Guideline B.10 However, such ties do raise a prima \nfacie security concern sufficient to require an applicant to present evidence of rebuttal, \nextenuation, or mitigation sufficient to meet the applicant\u2019s burden of persuasion that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance \nfor her. Id.     \n \nAG \u00b6 8 lists six mitigating conditions, and three of them are potentially applicable \nin this case: \n \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \n \n9 See generally, e.g, ISCR Case No.02-31154 at 4, fn.4 (citing ISCR Case No. 01-03120 (App. Bd. Feb. \n20, 2002) (App. Bd. Sept. 25, 2005).  \n \n10 Any cases cited in this decision that were issued prior to September 1, 2006, by the Appeal Board are \nbased on the previous Guidelines.  They are not being cited for their precedential value, and are not \ncontrolling, unless specifically stated. They are provided for their illustrative logic, and because they \nprovide some support for my comments. See e.g., ISCR Case No. 03-02382 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 15, \n2006); ISCR Case No. 99-0424 (App. Bd. Feb. 8, 2001). \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nU.S.; \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual's sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country is \nso minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships \nand loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any \nconflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest; and \n \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation. \n \n \nApplicant admitted that her father lived in China, and that her husband\u2019s parents \nlived with her.  Based on the record as a whole, the government established its case \nunder the AG.  Applicant has close family ties to the PRC, as evidenced by her father, \nand her mother-in-law\u2019s relatives living in China. The strength of the ties is also \ndemonstrated by Applicant traveling to the PRC to visit her father in 2001, and the \nphone calls she makes to him. Her mother-in-law frequently calls her relatives from \nApplicant\u2019s home phone. Her father-in-law made a recent trip to China. These \ncircumstances raise security concerns under AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a) 7(b), and 7(d). \n \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 8(a) and 8(c) do not apply. Applicant did not establish \u201cit is unlikely [she] \nwill be placed in a position of having to choose between the interests of [her father or in-\nlaws] and the interests of the U.S.\u201d  Her frequent contacts and close relationships with \nher father and in-laws living in the PRC could potentially force her to choose between \nthe United States and the PRC.  She did not meet her burden of showing there is \u201clittle \nlikelihood that [her relationships] could create a risk for foreign influence or exploitation.\u201d  \n \nAG \u00b6 8(b) partially applies because Applicant has \u201csuch deep and longstanding \nrelationships and loyalties in the U.S., [she] can be expected to resolve any conflict of \ninterest in favor of the U.S. interest.\u201d She has been in the United States since 1986, and \nhas been a citizen since 2000. She received her education in the U.S. She owns a U.S. \nhome, has a U.S. checking account, a U.S. 401(k), savings account, and owns no \nproperty in the PRC. Although this mitigating condition is partially applicable, it is \ninsufficient to fully overcome the foreign influence security concerns.  \n \nWhole Person Analysis  \n \n \nIn addition to the enumerated disqualifying and mitigating conditions as \ndiscussed previously, I have considered the general adjudicative AGs related to the \nwhole person concept under Directive \u00b6 E2.2.1. \u201cUnder the whole person concept, the \nAdministrative Judge must not consider and weigh incidents in an applicant\u2019s life \nseparately, in a piecemeal manner. Rather, the Judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s \nsecurity eligibility by considering the totality of an applicant\u2019s conduct and \n\n \n8 \n \n \n                                                          \ncircumstances.\u201d11 The directive lists nine adjudicative process factors (APF) which are \nused for \u201cwhole person\u201d analysis. Because foreign influence does not involve \nmisconduct, voluntariness of participation, rehabilitation and behavior changes, etc., the \neighth APF, \u201cthe potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress,\u201d Directive \u00b6 \nE2.2.1.8, is the most relevant of the nine APFs to this adjudication.12 In addition to the \neighth APF, other \u201c[available, reliable information about the person, past and present, \nfavorable and unfavorable, should be considered in reaching a determination.\u201d \n34Directive \u00b6 E2.2.1. Ultimately, the clearance decision is \u201can overall common sense \ndetermination.\u201d Directive \u00b6 E2.2.3. The Appeal Board requires the whole person \nanalysis address \u201cevidence of an applicant\u2019s personal loyalties; the nature and extent of \nan applicant\u2019s family\u2019s ties to the U.S. relative to his [or her] ties to a foreign country; his \nor her ties social ties within the U.S.; and many others raised by the facts of a given \ncase.\u201d13 \n \n \nSubstantial mitigating evidence weighs towards grant of Applicant\u2019s security \nclearance. Applicant has lived in the United States for approximately 22 years and has \nbeen a U.S. citizen since 2000. Her husband, her child and her mother live in the United \nStates.  Her husband\u2019s parents live with her. Her in-laws have applied for U.S. \ncitizenship, but twice have failed the language test. Her husband\u2019s father\u2019s entire family \nlives in the U.S. Her ties to these family members are stronger than her ties to family \nmembers in the PRC. Her family living in the United States is not vulnerable to direct \ncoercion or exploitation by a foreign power. The realistic possibility of pressure, \ncoercion, exploitation or duress with regard to her husband and child are low. There is \nno evidence she has ever taken any action which could cause potential harm to the \nUnited States. \n \n \nThree circumstances weigh against Applicant in the whole person analysis.  First, \nthe PRC is a nuclear power and PRC\u2019s government is a rival of the United States.  More \nimportantly for security purposes, the PRC is actively seeking classified and \nindustrial/economic information. The PRC may attempt to use her family living in the \nPRC or her mother-in-law\u2019s relatives living in the PRC to pressure Applicant to obtain \nsuch information. Second, her father and her mother-in-law\u2019s family live in the PRC and \nare PRC citizens. Her in-laws are citizens and residents in the PRC. Third, she has \nfrequent and non-casual contact with her father who lives in the PRC. In the last seven \n \n11ISCR Case No. 03-04147 at 3 (App. Bd.

Her contacts with family members and in-laws are \nmanifestations of her affection and regard for them.  \n \n \n\u201cBecause of the extreme sensitivity of security matters, there is a strong \npresumption against granting a security clearance.  Whenever any doubt is raised . . . it \nis deemed best to err on the side of the government\u2019s compelling interest in security by \ndenying or revoking [a] clearance.\u201d14 After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating \nconditions, all the facts and circumstances, in the context of the whole person, I \nconclude she has not mitigated the security concerns pertaining to foreign influence.  \nUltimately, the evidence leaves me with doubts as to Applicant\u2019s security eligibility and \nsuitability.  \n  \n \nI take this position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518 (1988), my \u201ccareful consideration of the whole person factors\u201d and \nsupporting evidence, my application of the pertinent factors under the Adjudicative \nProcess, and my interpretation of my responsibilities under the AGs.15 Applicant has not \nmitigated or overcome the government\u2019s case. For the reasons stated, I conclude she is \nnot eligible for access to classified information.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1.

Howry, Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nSYNOPSIS\nThe Applicant is a dual citizen of Iran and the United States.  He surrendered his expired\nIranian passport to his security officer, however, he is not willing to renounce his Iranian citizenship.\nClearance is denied. \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\n\n2\nOn May 25, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to\nExecutive Order 10865 (as amended), and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive),\ndated January 2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant, which detailed the\nreasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it\nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the\nApplicant and recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether a clearance\nshould be denied or revoked.\nThe Applicant responded to the SOR on July 10, 2007, and he requested a hearing before a\nDOHA Administrative Judge.  This case was assigned to the undersigned on August 9, 2007.  A\nnotice of hearing was issued on August 16, 2007, scheduling the hearing for September 26, 2007.\nAt the hearing the Government presented three exhibits.  The Applicant presented five exhibits and\ntestified on his own behalf.  The record was left open until October 8, 2007, to allow the Applicant\nan opportunity to provide additional evidence.  The Applicant submitted one Post-Hearing Exhibit\nthat was admitted into evidence and the record was closed on October 9, 2007.  The official\ntranscript (Tr.) was received on October 3, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nThe following Findings of Fact are based on Applicant's Answer to the SOR, the testimony\nand the exhibits.  The Applicant is 25 years of age and has a Master\u2019s Degree in Electrical\nEngineering.  He is employed as a Engineer for a  defense contractor.  He seeks a security clearance\nin connection with his employment in the defense industry.\nParagraph 1 (Guideline C - Foreign Preference).  The Government alleges in this paragraph that the\nApplicant is ineligible for clearance because he has acted in such a way as to show a preference for\nanother country over the United States.\nThe Applicant was born in the United States in 1982, to Iranian parents.  Thus, he is a dual\ncitizen of Iran and the United States.  He grew up and resided in the United States his entire life.  As\na child, he was an active member of the Boys Scouts of America.  He later obtained his\nundergraduate and graduate degrees from the University of California.  His achievements qualified\nhim for a highly selective internship with the Department of the Navy, and he was later offered a\nposition with a  Defense contractor.  As a child, in 1998, the Applicant traveled to Iran to visit\nrelatives by using  his parent\u2019s Iranian passport.  In 2001, he applied for and obtained his own Iranian\npassport.  He used his own Iranian passport to travel to Iran in 2002 and 2003.  His Iranian passport\nis currently expired and he surrendered it to his company security officer.  (See Applicant\u2019s Post-\nHearing Exhibit).\nThe Applicant wishes to retain his Iranian citizenship predominantly because of his\ngrandmothers in Iran.  His maternal grandmother is elderly and very close to the Applicant\u2019s mother.\nThe Applicant wants to be able to travel to Iran with his mother if an immediate emergency were to\narise.  His dual citizenship with Iran gives him the ability to travel to Iran on quick notice.      \n\n3\nParagraph 2 (Guideline B - Foreign Influence).  The Government alleges in this paragraph that the\nApplicant is ineligible for clearance because he has foreign contacts that could create the potential\nfor foreign influence that could result in the compromise of classified information.\nOutside of his mother and father, the Applicant has no family in the United States.  All of his\nfamily reside in Iran.  Specifically, the Applicant\u2019s grandmothers on both sides, an aunt, and uncles\non both sides are citizens of and reside in Iran.  The Applicant contacts his grandmothers in Iran\nabout once every couple of months.  He also has infrequent contact with his aunt and uncles in Iran.\nThe Applicant has no assets of any kind in Iran and does not believe that he stands to inherit\nanything from any of his relatives there in the future.\nI have taken administrative notice of the current political conditions in Iran.  The fact that\nIran has no diplomatic relations with the United States.  Iran\u2019s efforts to acquire nuclear weapons\nand other weapon of mass destruction, its support for and involvement in international terrorism, its\nsupport for violent opposition to the Middle East peace process, and it\u2019s dismal human rights\nrecords.  I have considered the fact that Iranian Government officials at all levels commit serious\nabuses of their power and authority.  The fact that Iran has terrorists activities, and is rampant with\ncrime and instability.  The overall deteriorating security situation in Iran, the human rights abuses,\nand the government corruption elevates the cause for concern in the case.  The United States may\nface no greater challenge from a single country than from Iran.    \nLetters of recommendation from the Applicant\u2019s supervisor and coworkers attest to the\nApplicant\u2019s outstanding technical and leadership support and his overall excellent performance on\nthe job.  He has their highest recommendation for a security clearance and is considered to be an\ninvaluable asset to the organization.  (See Applicant\u2019s Exhibit A).   \nApplicant\u2019s performance appraisals for the periods April 2006 through December 2006, and\nJanuary 2007 through December 2007, reflect that he either \u201cexceeds performance requirements\u201d\nor is \u201coutstanding\u201d is every category.  (See Applicant\u2019s Exhibit B). \nThe Applicant has received numerous awards and commendations from his employer for his\ncontributions to the company.  (See Applicant\u2019s Exhibit E).\nE-mail correspondence dated October 8, 2007, from the  Applicant\u2019s Facility Security Officer\nindicates that she is in possession of the Applicant\u2019s expired Iranian passport that will be kept in the\nApplicant\u2019s personal security file.  (See Applicant\u2019s Post-Hearing Exhibit).\n      \nPOLICIES\nSecurity clearance decisions are not made in a vacuum.  Accordingly, the Department of\nDefense, in Enclosure 2 of the 1992  Directive sets forth policy factors and conditions that could\nraise or mitigate a security concern; which must be given binding consideration in making security\nclearance determinations.  These factors should be followed in every case according to the pertinent\ncriterion.  However, the conditions are neither automatically determinative of the decision in any\ncase, nor can they supersede the Administrative Judge\u2019s reliance on her own common sense.\n\n4\nBecause each security clearance case presents its own unique facts and circumstances, it cannot be\nassumed that these factors exhaust the realm of human experience, or apply equally in every  case.\nBased on the Findings of Fact set forth above, the factors most applicable to the evaluation of this\ncase are:\nForeign Preference\n9.  The Concern.  When an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a foreign\ncountry over the United States, then he or he may be prone to provide information or make decisions\nthat are harmful to the interests of the United States.\nCondition that could raise a security concern:\n10.  (a) exercise of any right, privilege or obligation of foreign citizenship after becoming a\nU.S. citizen or through the foreign citizenship of a family member.\nConditions that could mitigate security concerns:\n11.  (a) dual citizenship is based solely on parent\u2019s citizenship or birth in a foreign country;\n11.  (e) the passport has been destroyed, surrendered to the cognizant security authority , or\notherwise invalidated.\nForeign Influence\n6.  The Concern.  Foreign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual has\ndivided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or induced to help a foreign\nperson, group, organization, or government in a way that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to\npressure or coercion by any foreign interest.  Adjudication under this Guideline can and should\nconsider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or financial interest is\nlocated, including, but not limited to, such considerations as whether the foreign country is known\nto target United States citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a risk of\nterrorism. \nCondition that could raise a security concern:\n7.  (a) contact with a foreign family member, business or professional associate, friend, or\nother person who is a citizen of or resident of a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened\nrisks of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion. \nConditions that could mitigate security concerns:\nNone.\n\n5\nIn addition, as set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive at pages 16-17, in evaluating the\nrelevance of an individual\u2019s conduct, the Administrative Judge should consider the following general\nfactors:\na.  The nature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding circumstances\nb.  The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation\n \nc.  The frequency and recency of the conduct\nd.  The individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct\ne.  The voluntariness of participation\nf.  The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavior changes\ng.  The motivation for the conduct \nh. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress\n \ni.  The likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nThe eligibility criteria established in the DoD Directive identify personal characteristics and\nconduct which are reasonably related to the ultimate question, posed in Section 2 of Executive Order\n10865, of whether it is \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d to grant an Applicant\u2019s request\nfor access to classified information.\nThe DoD Directive states, \u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period\nof a person\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the person is eligible for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is predicted upon the individual meeting\nthese personnel security guidelines.  The adjudicative process is the careful weighing of a number\nof variables known as the whole person concept.  Available, reliable information about the person,\npast and present, favorable and unfavorable should be considered in reaching a determination.   The\nAdministrative Judge can draw only those inferences or conclusions that have reasonable and logical\nbasis in the evidence of record.  The Judge cannot draw inferences or conclusions based on evidence\nwhich is speculative or conjectural in nature.  Finally, as emphasized by President Eisenhower in\nExecutive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under this order . . . shall be a determination in terms\nof the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the Applicant\nconcerned.\u201d\nThe Government must make out a case under Guideline C (foreign preference), and\nGuideline B (foreign influence) that establishes doubt about a person's judgment, reliability and\ntrustworthiness.  While a rational connection, or nexus, must be shown between Applicant's adverse\nconduct and his ability to effectively safeguard classified information, with respect to sufficiency of\nproof of a rational connection, objective or direct evidence is not required.\n\n6\nThen, the Applicant must remove that doubt with substantial evidence in refutation,\nexplanation, mitigation or extenuation, which demonstrates that the past adverse conduct, is unlikely\nto be repeated, and that the Applicant presently qualifies for a security clearance.\nAn individual who demonstrates a foreign preference and has foreign connections may be\nprone to provide information or make decisions that are harmful to the interests of the United States.\nThe mere possession of a foreign passport raises legitimate questions as to whether the Applicant\ncan be counted upon to place the interests of the United States paramount to that of another nation.\nThe Government must be able to place a high degree of confidence in a security clearance holder to\nabide by all security rules and regulations, at all times and in all places.\nCONCLUSIONS\nHaving considered the evidence of record in light of the appropriate legal standards and\nfactors, and having assessed the Applicant's credibility based on the record, this Administrative\nJudge concludes that the Government has established its case as to all allegations in the SOR.   \nUnder Foreign Preference, Disqualifying Condition 10(a) exercise of any right, privilege or\nobligation of foreign citizenship after becoming a U.S. citizen or through the foreign citizenship of\na family member applies.  Mitigation Conditions 11(a) dual citizenship is based solely on parent\u2019s\ncitizenship or birth in a foreign country, and 11(e) the passport has been destroyed, surrendered to\nthe cognizant security authority, or otherwise invalidated also apply, but are not controlling in this\ncase.  Granted, the Applicant\u2019s Iranian passport has expired and he has surrendered it to his company\nsecurity officer.  However, he is not willing to renounce his Iranian citizenship.  Under the particular\ncircumstances of this case, simply surrendering his expired Iranian passport without renouncing his\nIranian citizenship is meaningless.  His decision not to renounce his Iranian citizenship does not\nshow a strong preference for the United States.  Furthermore, as a dual national with Iran, nothing\nprevents the Applicant from obtaining another Iranian passport in the future.  Under the\ncircumstances of this case, I find against the Applicant under Guideline C (Foreign Preference). \nUnder Foreign Influence, Disqualifying Condition (7a) contact with a foreign family member,\nbusiness or professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident of a foreign\ncountry if that contact creates a heightened risks of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation,\npressure, or coercion applies.  None of the mitigating conditions apply. \nExcept for his mother and father, the Applicant has no other family in the United States.  All\nof his relatives are citizens of and reside in Iran.  The Applicant\u2019s family members in Iran include\nhis maternal and paternal grandmothers, an aunt and several uncles.  The Applicant is very close to\nhis mother and grandmothers and is not willing to renounce his Iranian citizenship.  Although there\nis no evidence that any of his family members in Iran are associated in any way with the Iranian\ngovernment, there is strong evidence of affection with his immediate family.  Moreover, the current\npolitical situation in Iran elevates the cause for concern in this case.  The possibility of foreign\ninfluence exists that could create the potential for conduct resulting in the compromise of classified\ninformation.  I find that the Applicant is vulnerable to foreign influence.  Accordingly, I find against\nthe Applicant under Guideline B (Foreign Influence).\n\n7\nConsidering all the evidence, the Applicant has not met the mitigating conditions of\nGuidelines C and B of the adjudicative guidelines set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive.\nAccordingly, he has not met his ultimate burden of persuasion under Guidelines C and B.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal Findings For or Against the Applicant on the allegations in the SOR, as required by\nParagraph 25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive are:\nParagraph 1: Against the Applicant.\nSubparas.\n1.a.: Against the Applicant\n1.b.: Against the Applicant\nParagraph 2: Against the Applicant.\nSubparas.\n2.a.: Against the Applicant\nSubparas.\n2.b.: Against the Applicant\n \nSubparas.\n2.c.: Against the Applicant\n \nSubparas.\n2.d.: Against the Applicant\n \nDECISION\nIn light of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly consistent\nwith the national interests to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant.\nDarlene Lokey Anderson\nAdministrative Judge\n \n",

The\n1\nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a security clearance\nfor Applicant.  As required by Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within\nIndustry, dated February 20, 1960, as amended, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6,\nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive), dated January 2,\n1992, as amended, DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) on December 22, 2006, detailing\nthe basis for its decision \u2013 security concerns raised under Guideline B (Foreign Influence) and\nGuideline C (Foreign Preference) of the Directive.  The President issued revised adjudicative\nguidelines (Guidelines) on December 30, 2005.  DoD implemented them on September 1, 2006.\nPending official amendment/reissue of DoD Directive 5220.6, the Guidelines are to be used in all\ncases when the SOR is dated on or after September 1, 2006.  Because the SOR was issued after\nSeptember 1, 2006, DoD policy requires that this case proceed under the revised guidelines. \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on January 16, 2007, and elected to have a hearing\nbefore an administrative judge.

Applicant came to United States in 1973, when he was 19 years old..\n6\nHe attended college earning the an Associates degree. Applicant owns a house, a rental\ncondominium, and another condominium in a southern state.   He has a 401(k) account, checking\n7\nand savings accounts, and he has coached a children\u2019s soccer team for about five years.   During the\n8\nhearing, Applicant tore his Iranian passport into four pieces, and stated his intent to revoke his\nIranian citizenship.   He has traveled to Iran about every year and a half to two years, his last trip\n9\nbeing in 2005.10\nHis oldest brother lives in Iran, and conducts an import/export business.  He does business\nwith local Gulf countries and Turkey.  He now only makes about one deal a year.  He is not married\nand he has no children.  His other brother is afflicted with Down\u2019s  Syndrome and is geared for by\nthe older brother. .  His sister is a homemaker, married to a rug merchant, who owns his own\n11\nbusiness.  They have two children, one living in Iran, and the other in the United States.  He talks\nto his sister about once per month..  He speaks to his brother twice a month.  He has some distant\ncousins, but does not talk to them. .  He has one aunt who recently stayed with him for a week, and\n12\nspent about three months with her son living in the U.S.  His uncle formerly owned an automobile\nand farm equipment dealership in Iran.  Applicant stays with this uncle and his wife when he visits\nIran. \nIran is an authoritarian, constitutional, theocratic republic, dominated by the Shi\u2019a Muslim\nclergy.   Islamic law is the basis of the state\u2019s authority.  Human rights violations continue,\n13\nparticularly against journalists who speak out against Iran\u2019s current government, minority religions,\nand political activists, who oppose the current ruling regime.   Serious mistreatment of prisoners\n14\noccurs.  Human rights problems such as summary execution, torture, arbitrary arrest, prolonged\nsolitary confinement, and official corruption have been reported.  Although human rights violations\nare prohibited by law, the Iranian government does not enforce the law. \nIran has been one of the most active state sponsors of terrorism.  It is increasingly involved\nin supplying lethal assistance to Iraqi militant groups in support of terrorist activity against the U.S.\n\nGovernment Exhibit 6 ( \u201cIran: U.S. Concerns and Policy Responses,\u201d Congressional Research Service Report, dated\n15\nJanuary 5, 2007) at 20-21. \nGovernment Exhibit 3, supra, note 13, at 8; Exhibit 8 (Country Reports on Terrorism, Chapter 6 \u2013 State Sponsors of\n16\nTerror, Overview, Office of the Coordinator for Counterterrorism, dated April 28, 2006) at 1.\nGovernment Exhibit 8, supra, note 16, at 173.\n17\n5\nforces in Iraq.  Iran supported the June 25, 1996, truck bombing of the Khobar Towers in Saudi\nArabia, a terrorist act that killed 19 U.S. military personnel and wounded 500.   The current Iranian\n15\ngovernment supports and actively sponsors terrorism by providing resources, guidance and a safe\nhaven to terrorists.   Iran continues to be unwilling to bring to justice senior al-Qaida members, and\n16\nhas resisted numerous requests to transfer custody of its al-Qaida detainees to their countries of\norigin or to third countries for interrogation and/or trial.  Iran presents a particular concern, given its\nactive sponsorship of terrorism and its continued development of a nuclear program.  Iran is also\ncapable of producing biological and chemical agents or weapons.  Iran could support terrorist\norganizations seeking to acquire weapons of mass destruction (WMD).  \n17\nPOLICIES\nIn an evaluation of an applicant\u2019s security suitability, an administrative judge must consider\nthe \u201cAdjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility For Access to Classified Information\u201d\n(Guidelines).  In addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative\nguidelines are divided into Disqualifying Conditions (DC) and Mitigating Conditions (MC), which\nare used to determine an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible ironclad rules of law.  Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed\nin the adjudicative process. Guideline \u00b6 2.  An administrative judge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal\nis a fair, impartial and common sense decision.  Because the entire process is a conscientious\nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person concept,\u201d an administrative judge\nconsiders all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and\nunfavorable, in making a decision. Guideline \u00b6 2(c).\nSpecifically, an administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors\nlisted at Guideline \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency\nand recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5)\nextent to which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d\nSince the protection of the national security is the paramount consideration, the final decision\nin each case is arrived at by applying the standard that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being\nconsidered for access to classified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d\nGuideline \u00b6 2(b).  In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable,\n\n\u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion\n18\nin light of all the contrary evidence in the record.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing\nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.32.1).  \u201cThis is something less than the weight of the evidence, and the possibility of drawing two\ninconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent [a Judge\u2019s] finding from being supported by substantial\nevidence.\u201d Consolo v. Federal Maritime Comm\u2019n, 383 U.S. 607, 620 (1966).  \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a\nscintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4  Cir. 1994).\nth\n\u201cThe Administrative Judge [considers] the record evidence as a whole, both favorable and unfavorable, evaluate[s]\n19\nApplicant\u2019s past and current circumstances in light of pertinent provisions of the Directive, and decide[s] whether\nApplicant ha[s] met his burden of persuasion under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 04-10340 at 2 (App. Bd. July\n6, 2006).\n6\nlogical and based on the evidence contained in the record.  Likewise, I have avoided drawing\ninferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nIn the decision-making process, facts must be established by \u201csubstantial evidence.\u201d   The\n18\nGovernment initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish a case which demonstrates,\nin accordance with the Directive, that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant\nor continue an applicant\u2019s access to classified information.  Once the Government has produced\nsubstantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, the burden shifts to Applicant to present \u201cwitnesses\nand other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by\nDepartment Counsel, and [applicant] has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a\nfavorable clearance decision.\u201d  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  The burden of disproving a mitigating condition\nnever shifts to the Government.  See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).19\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with\nthe Government predicated upon trust and confidence.  This relationship transcends normal duty\nhours and endures throughout off-duty hours.  The Government reposes a high degree of trust and\nconfidence in individuals to whom it grants access to classified information.  Decisions under this\nDirective include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk an applicant may deliberately or\ninadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified information.  Such decisions entail a certain\ndegree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nThe scope of an administrative judge\u2019s decision is limited.  Nothing in this Decision should\nbe construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole or in part, on any express or implied\ndetermination as to Applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or patriotism.  Executive Order 10865, \u00a7 7. \nCONCLUSIONS\nGuideline B\u2014Foreign Influence\n\n7\nGuidelines \u00b6 6. The Concern. Foreign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the\nindividual has divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or induced to help\na foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way that is not in U.S. interests, or is\nvulnerable to pressure or coercion by any foreign interest.  Adjudication under this Guideline can\nand should consider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or financial\ninterest is located, including, but not limited to, such considerations as whether the foreign country\nis known to target United States citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with\na risk of terrorism.\nGuidelines \u00b6 7. Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying\ninclude:\n(a) contact with a foreign family member, business or professional associate, friend, or other\nperson who is a citizen of or resident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of\nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion;\n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that create a potential\nconflict of interest between the individual's obligation to protect sensitive information or technology\nand the individual's desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing that information;\n(e) a substantial business, financial, or property interest in a foreign country, or in any\nforeign-owned or foreign-operated business, which could subject the individual to heightened risk\nof foreign influence or exploitation.\nGuidelines \u00b6 8. Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include:\n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which these persons\nare located, or the positions or activities of those persons in that country are such that it is unlikely\nthe individual will be placed in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign\nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the U.S.;\n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual's sense of loyalty or obligation\nto the foreign person, group, government, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep\nand longstanding relationships and loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to\nresolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest; and\n(f) the value or routine nature of the foreign business, financial, or property interests is such\nthat they are unlikely to result in a conflict and could not be used effectively to influence,\nmanipulate, or pressure the individual.\nThe mere possession of close family ties with a person in a foreign country is not, as a matter\nof law, disqualifying under Guideline B.  However, if only one relative lives in a foreign country,\nand an applicant has contacts with that relative, this factor alone is sufficient to create the potential\nfor foreign influence and could potentially result in the compromise of classified information.  See\nISCR Case No. 03-02382 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 15, 2006); ISCR Case No. 99-0424 (App. Bd. Feb. 8,\n2001).  Applicant has frequent contacts and a close relationship with his siblings, who are residents\nand citizens of Iran.  This close relationship with his siblings creates a heightened risk of foreign\n\n8\npressure or attempted exploitation because Iranian agents actively seek intelligence, classified and\neconomic information from United States\u2019 businesses.  His connections to his siblings also create\na potential conflict of interest because his relationship is sufficiently close to raise a security concern\nabout his desire to help his siblings or Iran by providing sensitive or classified information. \nThe Government produced substantial evidence of these two disqualifying conditions,\nand the burden shifted to Applicant to produce evidence and prove a mitigating condition.  As\npreviously indicated, the burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government.\nIran is hostile to the U.S. and is ruled by a radical Islamic fundamentalist government with a poor\nrecord of human rights.  With this history it is not difficult to envision a scenario in which\nApplicant\u2019s relatives could be subjected to some or all of these arbitrary denials of basic human\nrights in an effort to put pressure on Applicant to divulge classified information.  Iran is actively\npursuing nuclear capability, has chemical and biological capabilities, and is a sponsor of terrorism.\nGiven these circumstances - which are clearly beyond Applicant's control - the presence of\nApplicant's family in Iran places them at risk of being brought under control or used as a hostage by\nan Iranian intelligence or security service.  The mere fact that they live in Iran means they are in a\nposition where there is a potential for them to be exploited in a way that could force Applicant to\nchoose between loyalty to his family members and the interests of the U.S.  Accordingly, Applicant\nis unable to successfully mitigate the security concern using the Guidelines \u00b6 8 (a) standard.\nUnder the mitigating condition of Guidelines \u00b6 8 (b) there is a conflict of interest because\nApplicant has such deep and longstanding relationships and loyalties to his family.  He was educated\nin the U.S.  He owns property here, and in Iran.  He has a 401(k) plan, stock investments, rental real\nestate in addition to his home.  His immediate family members in Iran are for the most part getting\nelderly.  He has substantial  contact with his immediate family members in Iran.  This raises a\nconcern of compromising his ability to keep classified information confidential.  \nAppellant, however, did not establish the mitigating conditions of Guideline \u00b6\u00b6 8(a) or 8(c)\nin regard to his siblings.  He did not establish \u201cit is unlikely [he] will be placed in a position of\nhaving to choose between the interests of [his siblings] and the interests of the U.S.\u201d  His frequent\ncontacts and close relationship with his siblings could potentially force him to choose between the\nUnited States and Iran.  He did not meet his burden of showing there is \u201clittle likelihood that [his\nrelationship with his siblings] could create a risk for foreign influence or exploitation.\u201d  \nGuideline \u00b6 8(b) partially applies because Appellant has developed a sufficient relationship\nand loyalty to the U.S., and he can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S.\ninterest. He has lived in the United States since 1973.  He became a U.S. citizen. He has three sisters\nwho are U.S. citizens. He received his college education in U.S. colleges and universities.  He\nrenounced his Iranian citizenship, and declared his exclusive loyalty to the United States, by tearing\nhis passport apart.  Although this mitigating condition is partially applicable, these facts are\ninsufficient to overcome the security concerns as discussed in the \u201cwhole person\u201d analysis, infra. \nGuideline C\u2014Foreign Preference\nGuidelines \u00b6 9. The Concern. When an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a\npreference for a foreign country over the United States, then he or he may be prone to provide\ninformation or make decisions that are harmful to the interests of the United States.\n\nISCR Case No. 03-17620 at 4 (App. Bd. Apr. 17, 2006) (footnotes omitted); accord ISCR Case No. 03-23259 at 3\n20\n(App. Bd. May 10, 2006).\n9\nGuidelines \u00b6 10. Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying\ninclude:\n(a) exercise of any right, privilege or obligation of foreign citizenship after becoming a U.S.\ncitizen or through the foreign citizenship of a family member.  This includes but is not limited to:\n(1) possession of a current foreign passport;\nGuidelines \u00b6 11. Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include:\n(a) dual citizenship is based solely on parents' citizenship or birth in a foreign country;\n(b) the individual has expressed a willingness to renounce dual citizenship;\n. \n(e) the passport has been destroyed, surrendered to the cognizant security authority, or\notherwise invalidated.\nThe government established its case under Guidelines \u00b6 10 (a) (2), because Applicant held\na valid Iranian passport, had exercised dual citizenship by using the passport to travel to Iran on\nnumerous occasions, and at the time the SOR was issued was refusing to surrender it.  At the\nhearing, after learning that keeping his Iranian passport would make a security clearance problematic,\nhe then expressed a willingness to and did renounce his Iranian citizenship and tore his Iranian\npassport into four pieces.  \nThe mitigating conditions under Guidelines \u00b6 11 (a) (b) and (e) are applicable to successfully\nmitigate the security concerns.  Applicant\u2019s dual citizenship is based on his parents citizenship and\nhis birth in Iran.  I conclude Guideline C for Applicant.\nWhole Person Analysis\nIn assessing whether an applicant is a security risk because of his or his relatives or associates\nin a foreign country, it is necessary to consider all relevant factors.  As noted above, \u00b6\u00b6 E2.2.1,\nE2.2.2, and E2.2.3 of the Directive specifically require each administrative judge to consider all the\nfacts and circumstances, including the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept, when evaluating each individual\ncase.  To ignore such evidence would establish a virtual per se rule against granting clearances to any\nperson with ties to persons in a foreign country, which is contrary to the clear terms of the Directive.\n\u201cAlthough the position of an applicant\u2019s foreign family members is significant and may preclude the\nfavorable application of Foreign Influence Mitigating Conditions E2.A2.1.3.1., the totality of an\napplicant\u2019s conduct and circumstances (including the realistic potential for exploitation) may still\nwarrant a favorable application of the relevant general factors.\u201d20\n\nDirective, \u00b6 E2.2.1.8.\n21\nISCR Case No. 03-21423 at 7-10.\n22\nSee ISCR Case No.  04-11414 at 4 (App. Bd.  March 5, 2007).\n23\nISCR Case No. 04-00540 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan. 5, 2007).\n24\n10\nOne of the \u201cwhole person\u201d factors which must be considered is \u201cthe potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress.\u201d   In that regard, an important factor for consideration is the\n21\ncharacter of any foreign power in question, including the government and entities controlled by the\ngovernment, within the relevant foreign country.  The relationship between a foreign government\nand the U.S. is relevant in determining whether a foreign government or an entity it controls is likely\nto attempt to exploit a resident or citizen to against the United States through the applicant.  The\nnature of the foreign government might also relate to the question of whether the foreign government\nor an entity it controls would risk jeopardizing its relationship with the United States by exploiting\nor threatening its private citizens in order to force a U.S. citizen to betray this country.  A hostile\nrelationship may make it more likely that Iran would attempt to exploit a U.S. citizen through his\nrelatives or associates.22\nIran is one of the least democratic countries in the Middle East.  Iran and the United States\nhave had poor relations for at least 27 years.  I believe it is probable that Iran would attempt to\nexploit Applicant\u2019s relatives to obtain classified information, and if it did, I believe Applicant would\nproperly notify the authorities.  The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress, is still\na prime concern.  However, other matters, such as evidence of an applicant\u2019s personal loyalties, the\nnature and extent of an applicant\u2019s family ties to the U.S. relative to his ties to a foreign country; his\nor her social ties within the U.S., and many others raised by the facts of a given case can properly\nbe factored in to a judge\u2019s evaluation of an applicant\u2019s worthiness of a security clearance.   \n23\nApplicant communicates with his siblings from once to twice per month.  He has a history\nof frequent trips to Iran to see his family.  The Appeal Board suggests that the whole person analysis\naddress \u201cevidence of an applicant\u2019s personal loyalties; the nature and extent of an applicant\u2019s\nfamily\u2019s ties to the U.S. relative to his ties to a foreign country; his or his ties social ties within the\nU.S.; and many others raised by the facts of a given case.\u201d   In the present case, there is a fair\n24\namount of information about positive attributes to Applicant\u2019s life as a U.S. citizen that could weigh\nin favor of granting him a security clearance, in response to the disqualification under Guideline B.\nI considered his age (52), his education which includes an associate college degree, his employment\nrecord, his reasons for travel to Iran, and his financial stability make him a better candidate for a\nsecurity clearance than he would be without these positive attributes.  However, his close contacts\nwith his family members who live in Iran and are subject to the potential terrorist activity and\ngovernment pressure outweigh his positive attributes. \nTo conclude, Applicant has failed to meet his ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a\nfavorable clearance decision.  But this decision should not be construed as an indictment of\nApplicant\u2019s loyalty and patriotism to the U.S., as those matters are not at issue.  Instead, the clearly-\nconsistent standard requires me to resolve any doubt against Applicant.  His close ties to family in\nIran create doubt about his security suitability.  In reaching my decision, I have considered the record\n\n11\nevidence as a whole, the whole-person concept, the clearly-consistent standard, and the appropriate\nfactors and guidelines in the Directive.  In view of the Appeal Board\u2019s standards, I conclude that he\nhas not mitigated the Guideline B concerns, and it is not clearly consistent with the national interest\nto grant or continue Applicant\u2019s security clearance.  I conclude Guideline B against Applicant.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required\nby E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1. Guideline B:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2. Guideline C:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.c:\nFor Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all of the circumstances in this case, it is not clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.  Clearance is denied.\nChristopher Graham\nAdministrative Judge\n",
