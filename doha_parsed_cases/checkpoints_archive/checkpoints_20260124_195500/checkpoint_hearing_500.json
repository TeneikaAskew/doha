Thompson, Esquire, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nHOGAN, Erin C., Administrative Judge: \n \nOn April 27, 2018, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued a Statement of \nReasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under Guideline F, Financial \nConsiderations. The action was taken under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) effective within the \nDOD on June 8, 2017.  \n \n \nOn June 27, 2018, Applicant answered the SOR and requested a decision on the \nrecord. Department Counsel issued a File of Relevant Material (FORM) on July 12, \n2018. On August 1, 2018, Applicant received the FORM. Applicant had 30 days to \nsubmit a response to the FORM. She did not submit a response. On September 20, \n2018, the FORM was forwarded to the Hearing Office and assigned to me on December \n12, 2018. Based upon a review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for \naccess to classified information is granted.  \n  \n \n \n   12/17/2018\n\n \n2 \n \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \n \nApplicant is a 35-year-old employee of a DOD contractor seeking a security \nclearance. She has worked for her current employer since 2013. Her highest level of \neducation is an associate\u2019s degree. She separated from her husband in 2010 and has \nan 18-year-old daughter from a previous relationship. (Item 3) \n \nOn February 1, 2018, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for \nInvestigations Processing. (Item 3) A subsequent background investigation revealed \nApplicant had the following delinquent debts: a $29,169 deficiency account on a \nmortgage that was foreclosed in 2014 (SOR \u00b6 1.a:  Item 5 at 2; Item 6 at 8); a $91 debt \nplaced for collection in January 2012 (SOR \u00b6 1.b: Item 5 at 2; Item 6 at 8) and two \nmedical accounts in the amounts of $345 and $181 placed for collection in December \n2012 and February 2013 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c and 1.d). In her response to the SOR, Applicant \nadmitted SOR \u00b6 1.a, but denied the remaining three allegations. (Item 2)  \n \nApplicant started having financial problems in 2010 when she separated from her \nhusband. He was unfaithful and eventually went to jail.  The record is not clear on \nwhether her husband remains incarcerated.  She could not make the mortgage \npayments without her husband\u2019s income. Her home was foreclosed in July 2014, which \nresulted in the deficiency balance alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a.   \n \nShe provided confirmation numbers next to each of the remaining SOR \nallegations. While it would have been better to have provided a statement from the \ncreditor indicating the debt was paid in full, I find SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c and 1.d for Applicant, \nbecause they are no longer on her most recent credit report. (see Item 5)   The $91 debt \nalleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b is a minimal amount and does not raise significant security \nconcerns. The debt of most concern is the $29,169 mortgage foreclosure deficiency \ndebt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a.  Applicant intends to pay this debt off when she completes \nmaking payments towards her smaller debts. \n \nThere are several debts that were not alleged in the SOR, which Appellant paid \noff.  At least five delinquent debts were paid off by Applicant before the SOR was \nissued. She appears to be systematically paying off her delinquent accounts when she \nis able to do so. (Item 4; see also Items 5 and 6) \n \nPolicies \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations \nfor each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and \nmitigating conditions, which are useful in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access \nto classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \n\n \n3 \n \n \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access for national \nsecurity eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis   \n \nGUIDELINE F: Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG & 18:       \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \n\n \n4 \n \n \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n \nAG \u00b6 19 notes several disqualifying conditions that could raise security concerns. \nThe disqualifying conditions that are relevant to Applicant\u2019s case include: \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and  \n \n(c)  a history of not meeting financial obligations.  \n  \nAll of the above disqualifying conditions apply because Applicant incurred several  \ndelinquent debts, to include a $29,000 deficiency balance as a result of a mortgage \nforeclosure.  \n \nThe security concern under Financial Considerations is broader than the \npossibility that a person might knowingly compromise classified information to obtain \nmoney or something else of value. It encompasses concerns about a person\u2019s self-\ncontrol, judgment, and other important qualities.  \n \nThe Government\u2019s substantial evidence and Applicant\u2019s admissions raised \nsecurity concerns under Guideline F. The burden shifted to Applicant to produce \nevidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the security concerns. (Directive \u00b6 \nE3.1.15) An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, and the burden \nof disproving it never shifts to the Government. (See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 \n(App. Bd. Sept. 22, 2005))  \n \nAG \u00b6 20 includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security concerns \narising from financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions potentially apply:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n\n \n5 \n \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \nfinancial counseling service, and there are clear indications the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; and  \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n \n  \nAG \u00b6 20(a) applies because Applicant was unable to pay the mortgage after she \nand her husband separated in 2010. Her ability to pay the mortgage was further \naggravated by her husband\u2019s incarceration. While Applicant still owes the mortgage \ndeficiency debt, she has paid off several of her delinquent accounts that were not \nalleged in the SOR. Applicant\u2019s financial situation occurred under unusual \ncircumstances that are unlikely to occur. Her efforts to resolve her financial situation \ndemonstrate reliability and trustworthiness.  \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b) applies because circumstances beyond Applicant\u2019s control adversely \naffected her financial situation. Her marital separation in 2010 and her husband\u2019s \nsubsequent incarceration affected her ability to pay her mortgage as well as other \nexpenses.  Two of the delinquent debts alleged in the SOR were medical expenses.  \nApplicant acted responsibly under the circumstances. She systematically resolved \nseveral debts that were not alleged in the SOR.  There is sufficient evidence to \nconclude that the two medical bills alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c and 1.d were paid.  They no \nlonger appear on her most recent credit report. Applicant acted responsibly under the \ncircumstances.  \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c) partially applies. While there is no indication that Applicant attended \nformal financial counseling, her current financial situation is relatively stable and within \nher control.  Given the circumstances, her financial situation could have been worse, but \nit is clear that she managed her debts within reasonable parameters. \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d) applies.  There is strong circumstantial evidence that Applicant has \nresolved the two medical debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c and 1.d.  I also considered the \nfive unalleged delinquent debts that Applicant resolved before the SOR was issued. \nApplicant is making a good-faith effort to resolve her delinquent debts.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \n\n \n6 \n \n \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \n \n \nI considered Applicant\u2019s employment history with a DOD contractor since 2013. I \nconsidered her marital separation and her estranged husband\u2019s incarceration. I \nconsidered that she is raising her daughter alone. I considered that circumstances \nbeyond Applicant\u2019s control contributed to her financial problems. Applicant is \nmethodically resolving her delinquent accounts within her ability to do so. The security \nconcerns raised under financial considerations are mitigated. Applicant is warned that \nfuture delinquent debts may result in her security clearance being revoked.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.d:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is  \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n \n \n                                           \n \n \n \n_________________ \nERIN C. HOGAN \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Item 6 was not authenticated as required by Directive \u00b6 E3.1.20. However, Applicant was informed by the Government that he was entitled to make corrections, additions, deletions, and updates to Item 6. Applicant was also informed that he was entitled to object to consideration of Item 6 on the ground that it was not authenticated. Applicant did neither in his response to the FORM. Therefore, I conclude that he has waived any objection to Item 6. I did not consider the summary of court records contained on the second page of Item 6. Findings of Fact Applicant, age 32, was married in 2013 and has three minor children. He received a high school diploma in 2005. He has been enrolled in a community college since August 2017, as part of the apprenticeship program with which he has been employed since January 2017. Applicant was previously granted a DOD security clearance in 2010.

Eligibility for \naccess to classified information is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on March 16, 2017. On \nDecember 21, 2018, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility \n(DOD CAF) sent him a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging security concerns under \nGuidelines J, E, and G. The DOD CAF acted under Executive Order (EO) 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) \nimplemented by the DOD on June 8, 2017. \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on February 21, 2019, and requested a decision on \nthe record without a hearing. Applicant completed two attachments to the SOR answer, \none on January 17, 2019 and another on February 21, 2019. The record does not explain \nthe reason for the two attachments. There is only one SOR answer in the record. On \nMarch 28, 2019, the Government sent a complete copy of its written case, a file of relevant \nmaterial (FORM) including documents identified as Items 1 through 9, to Applicant. He \n\n \n2 \n \nwas given an opportunity to submit a documentary response setting forth objections, \nrebuttal, extenuation, mitigation, or explanation to the Government\u2019s evidence. He \nreceived the FORM on April 2, 2019, and did not respond. Items 1 through 3 are the \npleadings in the case. Items 4 through 9 are admitted into evidence. The case was \nassigned to me on May 31, 2019. \n \nProcedural Matter \n \nUnless otherwise indicated by citation to another part of the record, I have \nextracted the below findings of fact from Applicant\u2019s SOR answer (Item 3), his SCA (Item \n4), and the summary of his two security clearance interviews (SI), dated December 2017 \n(Item 5) and October 2009 (Item 6). Item 6 was not authenticated as required by Directive \n\u00b6 E3.1.20. However, Applicant was informed by the Government that he was entitled to \nmake corrections, additions, deletions, and updates to Item 6. Applicant was also \ninformed that he was entitled to object to consideration of Item 6 on the ground that it was \nnot authenticated. Applicant did neither in his response to the FORM. Therefore, I \nconclude that he has waived any objection to Item 6. I did not consider the summary of \ncourt records contained on the second page of Item 6. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant, age 32, was married in 2013 and has three minor children. He received \na high school diploma in 2005. He has been enrolled in a community college since August \n2017, as part of the apprenticeship program with which he has been employed since \nJanuary 2017. Applicant was previously granted a DOD security clearance in 2010. \n \nThe SOR alleged twelve criminal charges including assault and strangulation of a \nfamily member (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 2.a), three incidents of driving under the influence (DUI) \n(SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.k, 1.l, 2.a, 3.a), four incidents of contempt of court (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d, 1.e, 1.g, \n1.h, 2.a), and four incidents of driving on a suspended license (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c, 1.f, 1.i, 1.j, \n2.a). In his SOR answer, Applicant admitted the following Guideline J allegations: SOR \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.c, 1.f, and 1.k. Applicant did not respond to the Guideline E and G \nallegations, which I have construed as denials.  \n \n \n \nIn December 2016, Applicant was involved in a disagreement with his wife \nconcerning their child. Applicant\u2019s wife alleged that he assaulted and strangled her, for \nwhich he was arrested and charged (SOR \u00b6 1.b). Applicant claimed that his wife tried to \nrun him over with a vehicle, and admitted that he grabbed her in an effort to stop her from \ndoing so. However, he denied either assaulting or strangling his wife. A court dismissed \nboth charges. Applicant and his wife have since reconciled and remain married. (Item 5 \nat 6 and 8; Item 9 at 5). The Government did not provide any documents to challenge \nApplicant\u2019s version of the facts surrounding the incident or the court\u2019s disposition. (Item 9 \nat 5, details only the charges).  \n \nApplicant admitted two of the three alleged DUI charges. The record established \none DUI in 2009 (SOR \u00b6 1.k) and another in 2017 (SOR \u00b6 1.a). A 2007 DUI (SOR \u00b6 1.l) \nwas alleged based on the apparent mistaken reliance of a date referenced as \u201cpossibly \n\n \n3 \n \nin 2007\u201d in one portion of Applicant\u2019s 2017 SI. (Item 5 at 7). However, in another portion \nof that same 2017 SI, the \u201cpossibly in 2017\u201d reference was corrected to 2009. (Item 5 at \n7-8). Applicant provided inconsistent accounts of the facts and circumstances of his 2009 \nDUI during his 2008 and 2017 SIs. The Government neither alleged nor otherwise noted \nthe discrepancy, nor did it provide any documents to detail the facts and circumstances \nof the 2009 DUI.  \n \nIn February 2009, Applicant did not feel impaired and believed that he was okay \nto drive after consuming alcohol. The facts and circumstances surrounding his \nconsumption of alcohol prior to driving are uncertain given Applicant\u2019s differing accounts. \nHe was pulled over by a police officer for speeding. A breathalyzer revealed a blood \nalcohol count of .12%. Applicant was arrested and charged with DUI. In June 2009, a \ncourt adjudicated him guilty and sentenced him to 90 days in jail (suspended), restricted \nhis driver\u2019s license for a year, ordered him to attend Alcohol Safety Action Program \n(ASAP) classes, and fined him $250. (Item 5 at 7-8; Item 6 at 1; Item 8 at 15-16; Item 9 \nat 5). \n \nApplicant\u2019s March 2017 DUI occurred three days after he submitted his SCA. On \nthat occasion, he consumed five beers over the course of two to three hours while he was \nat a bar with a friend. He did not feel impaired and believed that he was okay to drive \nwhen they left to meet another friend. Applicant hit a guard rail after being cut off by a \nsemi-truck on an interstate highway. The officer responding to the accident smelled \nalcohol on Applicant\u2019s breath and administered a breathalyzer, which registered an blood \nalcohol count of .12%. Applicant was arrested and charged with DUI. In January 2018, a \ncourt adjudicated him guilty and sentenced him to 6 months in jail (all but 10 weekend \ndays suspended), placed him on unsupervised probation for three years, restricted his \ndriver\u2019s license for three years, ordered the installation of an interlock device on his \nvehicle for six months, ordered him to attend ASAP classes, and fined him $500. Applicant \ncompleted his jail term in February 2018. (Item 5 at 6-8; Item 7; Item 8 at 1-2). \n \nApplicant does not believe that he has a problem with alcohol and has never been \ndiagnosed alcohol dependent or an alcohol abuser. He began consuming alcohol at the \nage of 21, regularly consuming approximately two beers a week in social settings with \nothers. After his daughter was born in February 2014, he reduced the frequency of his \nconsumption to special occasions approximately twice per year, during which he would \ndrink to intoxication (approximately five beers). As of December 2017, Applicant had not \nconsumed any alcohol since his March 2017 DUI and expressed a future intent to abstain \nfrom any consumption of alcohol or driving after consuming alcohol. He cited his daughter \nand career as motivation for the abstention. (Item 5 at 9).  \n \n \nIn his SOR answer, Applicant denied all four contempt of court charges alleged in \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d, 1.e, 1.g, and 1.h. In August 2009, a court adjudicated Applicant guilty in \nabsentia of the June 2009 charge alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.h. (Item 8 at 17-18). The charges \nalleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d, 1.e, and 1.g involved a mistaken identity and were dismissed by \nthe court in December 2015. (Item 5 at 8; Item 8 at 3-8, 9 at 5). \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \nApplicant was convicted of two of the four driving on suspended license charges \nalleged in the SOR; the other two were dismissed by the court. Despite Applicant\u2019s claim \nthat his license had been reinstated at the time he was charged in April 2009 (SOR \u00b6 1.i), \nthe court adjudicated him guilty in June 2009 and fined him $100. (Item 6 at 1; Item 8 at \n11-12). In June 2013, a court adjudicated Applicant guilty of the March 2013 charge (SOR \n\u00b6 1.c), sentenced him to 30 days in jail (suspended), suspended his driver\u2019s license for \n90 days, and fined him $750. (Item 8 at 9-10). Although Applicant did not claim mistaken \nidentity as to the November 2010 charge (SOR \u00b6 1.f), the record suggests that it was \ndismissed for that reason on December 2015. (Item 8 at 7-8). The November 2010 charge \nwas initiated by the same complainant and adjudicated at the same time as the other \nmistaken identity charges noted above. Applicant\u2019s February 2009 charge (SOR \u00b6 1.j) \nstemmed from his 2009 DUI, and was dismissed by the court on the same day that the \nDUI was adjudicated. (Item 8 at 13-14). \n \nPolicies \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d (Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988)). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d (Egan at 527). \nThe President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant \napplicants eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d (EO 10865 \u00a7 2). \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the AG. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, \nrecognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies these \nguidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available and reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d (EO 10865 \u00a7 \n7). Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant has \nnot met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established \nfor issuing a clearance. \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. (Egan, 484 U.S. at 531). \u201cSubstantial \nevidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d (See v. Washington \nMetro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994)). The guidelines presume a \nnexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria listed \ntherein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. (ISCR Case No. 92-1106 at 3, 1993 WL \n545051 at *3 (App. Bd. Oct. 7, 1993)). Once the Government establishes a disqualifying \ncondition by substantial evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, \nextenuate, or mitigate the facts. (Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15). An applicant has the burden of \nproving a mitigating condition, and the burden of disproving it never shifts to the \nGovernment. (ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005)). \n \n  \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d (ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002)). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d (Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; AG \u00b6 2(b)). \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline J (Criminal Conduct) \n \n \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 30: Criminal activity creates \ndoubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. By its very nature, it \ncalls into question a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and \nregulations. \n \n \nThe alleged 2007 DUI was not established by the evidence. Applicant\u2019s 2009 and \n2017 DUIs and other charges establish the following disqualifying conditions under this \nguideline: \n \nAG \u00b6 31(a): a pattern of minor offenses, any one of which on its own would \nbe unlikely to affect a national security eligibility decision, but which in \ncombination cast doubt on the individual's judgment, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness; \n \nAG \u00b6 31(b): evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted; and \n \nAG \u00b6 31(c): individual is currently on parole or probation. \n \n \nAll of the charges except for the 2009 and 2017 DUIs have been mitigated by the \nfollowing applicable factor:  \n \n\n \n6 \n \nAG \u00b6 32(a): so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior \nhappened, or it happened under such unusual circumstances, that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment. \n \n \nNeither of the following applicable mitigating conditions under this guideline are \nestablished as to the 2009 and 2017 DUIs: \n \nAG \u00b6 32(a): so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior \nhappened, or it happened under such unusual circumstances, that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n \nAG \u00b6 32(d): there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not \nlimited to, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, \nrestitution, compliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or \nhigher education, good employment record, or constructive community \ninvolvement. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s 2009 and 2017 DUIs establish a pattern of criminal misconduct that \ncasts doubt about Applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness, and calls into \nquestion his ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. Applicant \nremains under the court\u2019s jurisdiction in connection with the 2017 DUI through at least \n2021. There has not been a passage of time sufficient to conclude that his questionable \njudgment and criminal misconduct will not recur.  \n \n \nWhile I do not consider any physical assault of a spouse to be a minor offense, I \nfind that Applicant\u2019s arrest for assault and strangulation resulted from isolated \ncircumstances that are unlikely to recur. Applicant has not been convicted of a charge \nrelated to contempt of court since 2009 or driving on a suspended license since 2013. I \nfind that sufficient time has elapsed that those incidents are unlikely to recur. \n \nGuideline E (Personal Conduct) \n \nThe security concern under this guideline, as set out in AG \u00b6 15, includes: \u201cConduct \ninvolving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply \nwith rules and regulations can raise questions about an individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive information.\u201d  \n \nThe alleged 2007 DUI was not established by the evidence. Applicant\u2019s 2009 and \n2017 DUIs and other charges establish the general concerns involving questionable \njudgment and unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, and the following \nspecific disqualifying condition under this guideline: \n \nAG \u00b6 16(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas \nthat is not sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-person \n\n \n7 \n \nassessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack \nof candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other \ncharacteristics indicating that the individual may not properly safeguard \nclassified or sensitive information. \n \n \nIncorporating my comments under Guideline J, the security concerns raised under \nthis guideline have been mitigated by the following applicable factor as to all the charges \nexcept for the 2009 and 2017 DUIs: \n \nAG \u00b6 17(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the \nbehavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances \nthat it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s \nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.  \n \nGuideline G (Alcohol Consumption) \n \n \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 21: Excessive alcohol \nconsumption often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment or the failure to control \nimpulses, and can raise questions about an individual's reliability and trustworthiness. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s excessive alcohol consumption, resulting in his 2009 and 2017 DUIs, \nestablishes the following disqualifying conditions under this guideline: \n \nAG \u00b6 22(a): alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while \nunder the influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, \nor other incidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the individual's \nalcohol use or whether the individual has been diagnosed with alcohol use \ndisorder; and \n \nAG \u00b6 22(c): habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired \njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed with alcohol \nuse disorder. \n \n \nNeither of the following applicable mitigating conditions under this guideline are \nestablished: \n \nAG \u00b6 23(a): so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, \nor it happened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur \nor does not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, \nor judgment; and \n \nAG \u00b6 23(b): the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive \nalcohol use, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, \nand has demonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified \nconsumption \nor \nabstinence \nin \naccordance \nwith \ntreatment \nrecommendations. \n \n \n\n \n8 \n \n \nThe security significance of Applicant\u2019s 2009 DUI is brought current by his more \nrecent 2017 DUI. Together they raise questions about Applicant\u2019s good judgment, \nreliability and trustworthiness. Of particular concern is the fact that he was arrested for \nhis second DUI three days after he completed his SCA. Applicant has not demonstrated \na sufficient pattern of modified behavior for me to conclude that his excessive \nconsumption of alcohol and questionable judgment are behind him.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether the granting or continuing \nof national security eligibility is clearly consistent with the interests of national security \nmust be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nfollowing guidelines, each of which is to be evaluated in the context of the whole person. \nAn administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \n\u00b6 2(d): \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nI have incorporated my comments under Guidelines J, E, and G in my whole-\nperson analysis, and I have considered the factors AG \u00b6 2(d). After weighing the \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guidelines J, E, and G, and evaluating all \nthe evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude that Applicant has not \nmitigated security concerns raised by the excessive alcohol consumption, personal \nconduct, and criminal misconduct underlying his two DUI charges, the most recent of \nwhich occurred in 2017 and for which he is currently on probation. Accordingly, Applicant \nhas not carried his burden of showing that it is clearly consistent with the national interest \nto grant him eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline J:  \n \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nSubparagraphs 1.b \u2013 1.j:  \nFor Applicant \n \nSubparagraphs 1.k:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n\n \n9 \n \nSubparagraphs 1.l:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:   \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \nAgainst Applicant (as to subparagraphs \n1.a and 1.k) \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFor Applicant (as to subparagraphs 1.b \n\u2013 1.j and 1.l) \n \nParagraph 3, Guideline G:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 3.a:  \n \nAgainst Applicant (as to subparagraphs \n1.a and 1.k) \n \nFor Applicant (as to subparagraph 1.l) \n \nConclusion \n \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant \nApplicant eligibility for access to classified information.

Nagel, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se   \n \n \n08/08/2019 \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \n \nLEONARD, Michael H., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant contests the Defense Department\u2019s intent to deny her eligibility for \naccess to classified information. The evidence is not sufficient to mitigate her history of \nfinancial problems. She has not made a good-faith effort to resolve more than $80,000 \nin delinquent debt. Accordingly, this case is decided against Applicant.    \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant completed and submitted a Standard Form (SF) 86, Questionnaire for \nNational Security Positions, the official form used for personnel security investigations, \non July 31, 2017. (Exhibit 1) This document is commonly known as a security clearance \napplication. Thereafter, on April 12, 2018, after reviewing the application and the \ninformation gathered during a background investigation, the Department of Defense \nConsolidated Adjudications Facility, Fort Meade, Maryland, sent Applicant a statement \nof reasons (SOR), explaining it was unable to find that it was clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant her eligibility for access to classified information. The SOR is \nsimilar to a complaint. It detailed the factual reasons for the action under the security \nguideline known as Guideline F for financial considerations.   \n\n \n2 \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on May 18, 2018. She provided handwritten \nresponses on the SOR in which she admitted all the allegations. She also provided a \none-page handwritten memorandum with explanations for the debts and proposed \ncorrective actions. She requested a hearing before an administrative judge.  \n  \nThe case was assigned to me on September 24, 2018. The hearing took place \non December 6, 2018. Applicant appeared without counsel. Department Counsel \noffered documentary exhibits, which were admitted as Exhibits 1-4. Applicant did not \noffer any documentary exhibits. Other than Applicant, no witnesses were called. The \nhearing transcript (Tr.) was received on December 14, 2018. \n \nThe record was kept open for approximately 30 days, until January 4, 2019, to \nprovide Applicant an opportunity to submit any documentation she thought appropriate, \nwith a focus on letters of recommendation and account statements for her student loans \nin collection. (Tr. 56-58) Applicant made a timely submission, by e-mail, on January 4, \n2019, and the one-page letter of recommendation is admitted without objections as \nExhibit A.    \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant is a 32-year-old employee who is seeking to obtain a security \nclearance for the first time. She is employed as a supplier-quality engineer for a large \ncompany in the defense industry. She has been so employed since 2017. Her annual \nsalary is about $71,000. (Tr. 34) Her formal education includes attendance at a private \nuniversity from August 2005 to December 2009, when she was awarded a bachelor\u2019s \ndegree in mechanical engineering. She also did some graduate work during 2016. She \nmarried in 2009. She and her husband have no children. Her husband works as a \ngeneral laborer for a transportation company with take-home pay of about $900 \nmonthly. (Tr. 34)  \n \nApplicant\u2019s post-college employment history has been inconsistent. (Exhibit 1) It \nincludes multiple jobs, periods of underemployment, and periods of unemployment as \nfollows: (1) she worked as a caregiver from January 2010 to January 2011; (2) she \nworked as a contract engineer from January 2011 to June 2011; (3) she was \nunemployed from June 2011 to September 2011; (4) she worked as a mechanical data \nteam member from September 2011 to April 2012; (5) she worked as an engineer from \nApril 2012 to May 2013; (6) she was unemployed from May 2013 to September 2013; \n(7) she worked as a data-entry clerk from September 2013 to February 2014; (8) she \nwas unemployed from February 2014 to April 2014; (9) she worked as a pizza-delivery \ndriver from April 2014 to May 2014; (10) she worked as an engineer from May 2014 to \nJune 2016; (11) she worked as an engineer from June 2016 to August 2016, when she \nwas fired for attendance issues within the first 90 days of employment; (12) she was \nunemployed from August 2016 to October 2016; (13) she worked as a grocery-store \nclerk from October 2016 to February 2017; (14) she was unemployed from February \n2017 to April 2017; and (15) she worked as kitchen staff at a restaurant from April 2017 \nuntil she began her current job in the defense industry in mid-2017.  \n  \n\n \n3 \n \nThe SOR alleges and Applicant admits a history of financial problems. In \nparticular, the SOR concerns 17 delinquent accounts for a total of about $95,000. Those \ndelinquent accounts fall into three categories: (1) 11 medical collection accounts in \namounts ranging from $138 to $5,790 for a total of about $14,361; (2) 4 student loan \naccounts in collection for a total of about $70,877; and (3) 2 collection accounts \nstemming from early termination of apartment leases for a total of about $10,325. In \naddition to her admissions, the delinquent accounts are established by credit reports \nfrom 2017 and 2018. (Exhibits 2, 3, and 4)  \n \nApplicant has made no progress in resolving any of the 17 delinquent accounts. \nShe did not present documentation to establish that any of those accounts were paid, \nsettled, in a payment arrangement, in dispute, cancelled, forgiven, or otherwise \nresolved. All 17 delinquent accounts are unresolved. \n \nIn both her answer to the SOR and in her hearing testimony, Applicant attributed \nher financial problems to her inconsistent employment history. Concerning the medical \ncollection accounts, she explained that those debts were incurred for necessary medical \ncare when she was uninsured. She has health insurance with her current job, but \notherwise was uninsured since aging-off her mother\u2019s health-insurance policy. (Tr. 28-\n29) Concerning the student loan accounts, she stated that that loans were at various \ntimes in forbearance, deferment, or income-based payment plans. (Tr. 39) She has not \nhad contact with the student loan creditors in 2018. (Tr. 55) She noted that she has \nother student loan accounts that are in good standing, as reflected in Exhibit 4. (Tr. 45) \nConcerning the apartment leases, she explained she was unable to complete the full \nterms of the leases due to changes in employment. (Tr. 46-50) She and her husband \nare in good standing with their current monthly rent and other living expenses. (Tr. 50-\n51)  \n \nApplicant has about $3,000 in savings in a checking account with a credit union. \n(Tr. 52-53) She participates in her employer\u2019s 401(k) plan. (Tr. 53) She has no other \nfinancial or investment accounts. Looking forward, she described a general plan to \naddress her indebtedness by reaching out to her creditors with the hope of reaching \naffordable payment plans. (Tr. 54-55)  \n \nApplicant has a good employment record for her current job based on the highly \nfavorable letter of recommendation submitted by a co-worker or supervisor or both. \n(Exhibit A) The letter described Applicant as diligent and motivated; with potential to be \na candidate for a long career; showing great integrity; and overall, an exceptional \nemployee with the highest standards who is suitable for a security clearance.  \n \nLaw and Policies \n \n \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (E.O.) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of \nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the National Security \n\n \n4 \n \nAdjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or \nEligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AG), effective June 8, 2017. \n \nIt is well-established law that no one has a right to a security clearance.1 As \nnoted by the Supreme Court in Department of the Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe clearly consistent \nstandard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the \nside of denials.\u201d2 Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive, any doubt \nabout whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified information will be \nresolved in favor of protecting national security. In Egan, the Supreme Court stated that \nthe burden of proof is less than a preponderance of evidence.3 The Appeal Board has \nfollowed the Court\u2019s reasoning, and a judge\u2019s findings of fact are reviewed under the \nsubstantial-evidence standard.4 \n \n \nThere is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for \naccess to classified information.5 Under the Directive, the parties have the following \nburdens: (1) Department Counsel has the burden of presenting evidence to establish \nfacts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted; (2) an applicant is responsible for \npresenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts that have been \nadmitted or proven; and (3) an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain \na favorable clearance decision.6 \n \nDiscussion \n \n \nUnder Guideline F for financial considerations, the suitability of an applicant may \nbe questioned or put into doubt when that applicant has a history of excessive \nindebtedness or financial problems or difficulties. The overall concern is set forth in AG \n\u00b6 18 as follows: \n \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . \n \n                                                          \n1 Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988) (\u201cit should be obvious that no one has a \n\u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance\u201d); Duane v. Department of Defense, 275 F.3d 988, 994 (10th Cir. 2002) (no \nright to a security clearance).  \n \n2 484 U.S. at 531. \n \n3 484 U.S. at 531. \n \n4 ISCR Case No. 01-20700 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002) (citations omitted).  \n \n5 ISCR Case No. 02-18663 (App. Bd. Mar. 23, 2004). \n \n6 Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.14 and E3.1.15. \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \nThe concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified or sensitive information to obtain money or something else of \nvalue. It encompasses concerns about a person\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other \nimportant qualities. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified or sensitive \ninformation. \n \n \nIn analyzing the facts of this case, I considered the following disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions as most pertinent:  \n \nAG \u00b6 19(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n \nAG \u00b6 19(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations;  \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were \nlargely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce, or \nseparation, clear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity \ntheft), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.  \n \n \nThe evidence supports a conclusion that Applicant has a history of financial \nproblems that is sufficient to raise a security concern under Guideline F. The \ndisqualifying conditions noted above apply to this case.  \n \n \nWith that said, I attach minimal security significance to the 11 medical collection \naccounts for a total of about $14,361. Applicant incurrent those debts for necessary \nmedical care and treatment when she was uninsured. Such indebtedness does not \nindicate poor self-control, frivolous or irresponsible spending, living beyond her means, \nor questionable judgment. On that basis, the matters in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c and 1.h through 1.q \nare decided for Applicant.  \n \n \nTurning to the matters in mitigation, the genesis of Applicant\u2019s financial problems \nis her inconsistent employment history, which includes multiple jobs and several periods \nof underemployment and unemployment. For the most part, these were circumstances \nlargely beyond her control. She acted reasonably under the circumstances by seeking \nwork wherever she could find it, to include working in jobs below her qualifications as a \nmechanical engineer. Given these circumstances, the mitigating condition at AG \u00b6 20(c) \napplies, and Applicant receives credit in mitigation.  \n \n \nApplicant has not made \u201ca good-faith effort\u201d to resolve the six collection accounts \nstemming from student loans and broken apartment leases. Taken together, she is \nfacing a small mountain of debt; about $70,000 for the four student loan accounts in \ncollection; and about $10,325 for the two apartment leases in collection. Given her \nmeans and limited financial assets, it is unlikely that any of those debts will be paid, \n\n \n6 \n \nsettled, or in a payment arrangement in the foreseeable future. Although Applicant has \nfaced difficulties since entering the workforce, she has simply made no progress in \nrepaying her overdue creditors or otherwise resolving the debts, and it is my \nassessment that she is unlikely to do so. Given these circumstances, the mitigating \ncondition at AG \u00b6 20(d) does not apply in Applicant\u2019s favor.  \n \n \nFollowing Egan and the clearly consistent standard, I have doubts and concerns \nabout Applicant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, good judgment, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. In reaching this conclusion, I weighed the evidence \nas a whole and considered if the favorable evidence outweighed the unfavorable \nevidence or vice versa. I also considered the whole-person concept. I gave particular \nconsideration to the highly favorable letter of recommendation submitted on Applicant\u2019s \nbehalf. Although Applicant presented some favorable evidence in mitigation, it was \noutweighed by the unfavorable evidence. I conclude that she has not met her ultimate \nburden of persuasion to show that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to \ngrant her eligibility for access to classified information.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nThe formal findings on the SOR allegations are: \n \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAgainst Applicant  \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a -- 1.b:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.d -- 1.g:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.h -- 1.q:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \naccess to classified information.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant denied the SOR allegations. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant is a 43-year-old employee of a defense contractor. (GX 1 at pages 5 and 13.) He has been employed with the defense contractor since October of 2014. (GX 1 at page 13.) He graduated from the U.S. Naval Academy in 1999, and achieved the rank of Lieutenant Commander until his departure from active duty in 2008. (GX 1 at pages 19~29, and AppX B.)

Schachter, Esq., Applicant\u2019s Counsel \n \n \nFebruary 14, 2019 \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nCEFOLA, Richard A., Administrative Judge: \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn April 26, 2018, in accordance with DoD Directive 5220.6, as amended \n(Directive), the Department of Defense issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) \nalleging facts that raise security concerns under Guideline F. The SOR further informed \nApplicant that, based on information available to the government, DoD adjudicators \ncould not make the preliminary affirmative finding it is clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s security clearance. \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on June 5, 2018, and requested a hearing before \nan administrative judge. (Answer.) The case was assigned to me on August 31, 2018. \nAs Applicant Counsel\u2019s firm had scheduling conflicts, the Defense Office of Hearings \nand Appeals (DOHA) could not issue a notice of hearing until November 2, 2018, \nscheduling the hearing for November 27, 2018. The hearing was convened as \nscheduled. The Government offered Exhibits (GXs) 1 and 2, which were admitted after \nApplicant authenticated GX 2. (Transcript (TR) at page 38 line 4 to page 39 line 16.) \nApplicant testified on his own behalf and called three witnesses to testify. Applicant \n\n \n2 \n \npresented documents, which I marked Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AppXs) A through H, and \n11~17. DOHA received the TR on December 7, 2018. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant denied the SOR allegations. After a thorough and careful review of the \npleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of fact.  \n \n \nApplicant is a 43-year-old employee of a defense contractor. (GX 1 at pages 5 \nand 13.) He has been employed with the defense contractor since October of 2014. (GX \n1 at page 13.) He graduated from the U.S. Naval Academy in 1999, and achieved the \nrank of Lieutenant Commander until his departure from active duty in 2008. (GX 1 at \npages 19~29, and AppX B.) While on active duty, Applicant went to \u201cJustice School,\u201d \nand was certified as \u201ca legal officer.\u201d He has held a security clearance since 1999. (Id, \nand TR at page 39 line 19 to page 41 line 25.) \n \nGuideline F - Financial Considerations \n \n \n1.a. and 1.b. Applicant failed to file both his Federal and state income tax returns, \nin a timely fashion, for tax years 2012~2016. (TR at page 28 line 20 to page 37 line 25, \nand at page 41 line 13 to page 48 line 20.) He was working several jobs, had some non-\nlife-threatening health issues, and a romantic break up with his \u201cgirlfriend.\u201d (Id.) He \navers that if he was due a refund; he was not required to file, but would forfeit any \nrefund. (TR at page 29 lines 2~21.) In light of Applicant\u2019s education from a U.S. military \nacademy, coupled with his attending the Naval Justice School, I find this averment not \nto be credible. \n \n \nApplicant subsequently filed all of his delinquent tax returns in May of 2018, as \nevidenced by documentation of those filings. (AppXs D, H and 24~29.) It is interesting to \nnote, that on his 2012 Federal income tax return (FITR) Applicant owed $1,322, and on \nhis 2014 FITR he owed $969. (AppX D.) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s current supervisor, prior supervisor, and a co-worker testified as to \nApplicant good character. (TR at page 15 line 22 to page 26 line 11.) However, his \ncurrent supervisor was surprised by Applicant\u2019s averment as to Applicant\u2019s lack of \nunderstanding of his responsibility to file his income tax returns. (TR at page 17 line 18 \nto page 18 line 6.) Applicant also submitted a favorable reference from another co-\nworker. (AppX C at page 5.)    \n \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility, the administrative \njudge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief introductory \nexplanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying \nconditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s \nnational security eligibility. \n \n\n \n3 \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the whole-person concept. The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states the \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \n \n \nA person who applies for access to classified information seeks to enter into a \nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order (EO) 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall \nbe \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the \nloyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F - Financial Considerations \n \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18: \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \n\n \n4 \n \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. One is potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \n \n  \nApplicant failed to file five years of income tax returns in a timely fashion. The \nevidence is sufficient to raise this disqualifying condition.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I considered \nall of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 including: \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n \nAlthough Applicant filed his delinquent income tax returns in 2018, his \nprocrastination is troubling. He also owed on his FITRs for tax years 2012 and 2014. \nThese debts to the Federal government were delinquent for five and three years, \nrespectively, until his 2018 filings. He has not acted reasonably with respect to his legal \nobligation to file his income tax returns. Guideline F is found against Applicant. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \n\n \n5 \n \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Applicant has a laudable history of \nworking in the defense industry and is respected by his supervisors and co-workers. He \nperforms well at his job. However, overall, the record evidence leaves me with \nquestions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. \nFor all these reasons, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the Financial \nConsiderations security concerns.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility \nfor a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n________________________ \nRichard A. Cefola \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Applicant claimed that he contacted the IRS and started the process to file and \npay his back taxes. The investigator discussed other accounts alleged during those \ninterviews. (Item 4) Applicant submitted no mitigating evidence that addressed any of \nthe allegations raised under this guideline. \n \n \n\n \n4 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \nPersonal Conduct \n \nApplicant\u2019s SOR lists seven separate allegations under this concern. He admitted \nall of the allegations. \n \nSummarized those allegations are: (1) the information alleged under criminal and \npersonal conduct was cross-alleged under this concern; (2) used illegal drugs with \nvarying frequency between 1988 until at least July 2015; (3) consumed alcohol at times \nto the point of intoxication with varying frequency from 1991 until at least April 2014; (4) \nmore than one of the arrests alleged under criminal conduct involved excessive \nconsumption of alcohol and/or use of illegal drugs; (5) fired in June 2011 for failure to \nfollow safety rules; (6) fired in April 2014 for abusing sick leave for which some of the \nabuse was related to excessive drinking; and (7) fired or quit in lieu of being fired in July \n2015 for testing positive on a drug test. \n \nThese allegations are established through Applicant\u2019s admissions and evidence \nsubmitted by the Government. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 3.a \u2013 3.g; Items 2 - 5) Applicant submitted no \nmitigating evidence that addressed any of the allegations raised under this guideline. \n \nDepartment Counsel\u2019s FORM discussed specific shortcomings of Applicant\u2019s \nanswer. He further emphasized long-standing DOHA case law that it is necessary for \napplicants to provide mitigating documentation. As noted, Applicant did not submit any \nadditional information within the 30-day period following his receipt of the FORM. \n \n \nPolicies \n \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \n\n \n5 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance \ndecision. \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n  \nAnalysis \n \n \n \n \nCriminal Conduct/Financial Considerations/Personal Conduct \n \nAG \u00b6 30 articulates the security concern for criminal conduct:  \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person's ability \nor willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations. \nAG \u00b6 31 describes three conditions that could raise a security concern and may \nbe disqualifying in this case:  \n \n(a) a pattern of minor offenses, any one of which on its own would be \nunlikely to affect a national security eligibility decision, but which in \ncombination cast doubt on the individual\u2019s judgment, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness; \n \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \n\n \n6 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted; \nand  \n \n(c) individual is currently on parole or probation.  \n \nBased on the evidence contained in the record under criminal conduct, AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n31(a), 31(b), and 31(c) are applicable. Further review is necessary. \nFour potential criminal conduct mitigating conditions are listed under AG \u00b6 32: \n \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment; \n \n(b) the individual was pressured or coerced into committing the act and \nthose pressures are no longer present in the person\u2019s life;  \n \n(c) no reliable evidence to support that the individual committed the \noffense; and   \n \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited \nto the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \n  \n  \nAG \u00b6 18 articulates the security concern for financial problems: \n  \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n \nAG \u00b6 19 describes three conditions that could raise a security concern and may \nbe disqualifying in this case:  \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n\n \n7 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired.  \n  \nBased on the evidence contained in the record under financial considerations, \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), 19(b), 19(c), and 19(f) are applicable. Further review is necessary. \nAG \u00b6 20 lists seven potential mitigating conditions: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue; \n \n(f) the affluence resulted from a legal source of income; and \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n \nAG \u00b6 15 articulates the security concern for personal conduct: \n \n\n \n8 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \nAG \u00b6 16 describes three conditions that could raise a security concern and may \nbe disqualifying in this case:  \n \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-\nperson \nassessment \nof \nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics that the individual may not properly \nsafeguard classified or sensitive information;   \n \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information, \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply \nwith rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the \nindividual may not properly safeguard classified or sensitive information. \nThis includes, but is not limited to, consideration of: \n \n(1) untrustworthy or unreliable behavior to include breach of \nclient confidentiality, release of proprietary information, \nunauthorized release of sensitive corporate or government \nprotected information;  \n \n(2) any disruptive, violent, or other inappropriate behavior; \n \n(3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations; and \n \n(4) evidence of significant misuse of Government or other \nemployer\u2019s time or resources. \n \n(f) violation of a written or recorded commitment made by the individual to \nthe employer as a condition of employment. \n \nBased on the evidence contained in the record under personal conduct, AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n(c), (d) (1)-(4), and (f) are applicable. Further review is necessary. \n \nSeven potential personal conduct mitigating conditions are listed under AG \u00b6 17:  \n \n\n \n9 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was \ncaused or significantly contributed to by improper or inadequate advice of \nauthorized personnel or legal counsel advising or instructing the individual \nspecifically concerning the security clearance process. Upon being made \naware of the requirement to cooperate or provide the information, the \nindividual cooperated fully and truthfully; \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, \nor other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur; \n \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress;  \n \n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable \nreliability; and \n \n(g) association with persons involved in criminal activity has ceased or \noccurs under circumstances that do not cast doubt upon the individual's \nreliability, trustworthiness, judgment, or willingness to comply with rules \nand regulations. \n \nInasmuch as Applicant submitted no mitigating evidence in response to the SOR \nor the FORM, none of the potential mitigating conditions were established under \ncriminal conduct, financial considerations, or personal conduct. \n \nThe Appeal Board concisely explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for proving the \napplicability of mitigating conditions as follows:  \n \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance \nof a security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government \npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the \napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The \nstandard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in \nEgan, supra. \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for \n\n \n10 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \naccess to classified information will be resolved in favor of the national \nsecurity.\u201d Directive, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 2(b).  \n \nISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 5 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013). \n \nIn summary, no mitigating conditions fully apply. In addition to evaluating the \nfacts and applying the appropriate adjudicative factors under Guidelines J, F, and E, I \nhave reviewed the record before me in the context of the whole-person factors listed in \nAG \u00b6 2(d). Without other information suggesting his long-standing problems are being \naddressed, doubts remain about his suitability for access to classified information. \nProtection of the national interest is the principal focus of these adjudications. \nAccordingly, those doubts must be resolved against Applicant. \n \nApplicant has a criminal history spanning over thirty years for which he currently \nremains on probation. This history includes multiple arrests for drug-related offenses, \nmultiple arrests for alcohol-related offenses and multiple arrests for illegal possession of \na firearm as a convicted felon. Applicant\u2019s history of convictions and his pattern of \nbehavior continue to call into question his ability and willingness to comply with laws, \nrules, and regulations. Although Applicant now claims that he has moved beyond the \nevents from his past, the passage of time is insufficient to mitigate his extensive criminal \nhistory. Additionally, Applicant remains on probation, which reflects his state\u2019s ongoing \nconcern regarding his behavior and makes his recent good behavior less probative of \nrehabilitation.  \n \nIn addition to Applicant\u2019s extensive criminal history, he has unresolved debts, \nmost notably an estimated $23,000 he owes in back taxes for multiple tax years. He \nclaimed that he filed his returns, but provided no information regarding when the filings \noccurred or the amount currently owed; nor did he provide any information regarding his \nnon-tax debts. The Appeal Board has consistently held that a person who is unwilling to \nfulfill his tax obligations \u201cdoes not demonstrate the high degree of good judgment and \nreliability required of persons granted to classified information.\u201d (ISCR Case No. 12-\n09545 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 21, 2015); ISCR Case No. 14-02694 at 4 (Dec. 9, 2015); \nISCR Case No. 14-02930 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 9, 2015); ISCR Case No. 14-03358 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Oct 9, 2015); ISCR Case No. 98-0810 at 4 (App. Bd. June. 8, 2000). \n \nApplicant has exhibited a long history of alcohol and drug abuse. His criminal \npast and substance abuse problems led to his terminations from various employers. \nAgain, enough time has not elapsed and further evidence is required to demonstrate \nsobriety and responsible conduct. \n \nApplicant chose to rely on the written record. In so doing, however, he failed to \nsubmit sufficient evidence to supplement the record with relevant and material facts \nregarding his circumstances, articulate his position, or mitigate the security concerns \nidentified.

Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.  \nStatement of the Case \nOn May 15, 2018, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility \n(DOD CAF) issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security \nconcerns under Guideline F, financial considerations. The action was taken under \nExecutive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \n(February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) effective within the DOD on June 8, 2017. \nApplicant answered the SOR on May 29, 2018, and elected to have his case \ndecided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. Department Counsel submitted the \nGovernment\u2019s file of relevant material (FORM), and Applicant received it on July 10, 2018. \nHe was afforded an opportunity to file objections and submit material in refutation, \n12/20/2018\n\n \n2 \n \n \nextenuation, or mitigation within 30 days of receipt of the FORM. The Government\u2019s \nevidence is identified as Items 1 through 6. Applicant submitted a timely response and \nhis exhibits are marked as Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AE) A through D. There were no \nobjections by Applicant or Department Counsel and all Items and exhibits and are \nadmitted into evidence. The case was assigned to me on October 11, 2018.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant admitted all of the SOR allegations except \u00b6 1.e. After a thorough and \ncareful review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of \nfact. \n \n \nApplicant is 35 years old. He served in the military from 2001 to 2005 and was \nhonorably discharged in the paygrade E-3. He attended college at different times and \nearned an associate\u2019s degree in 2015. He married in 2002 and divorced in 2009. He \nremarried in 2010. He has four children, ages 16, 13, 10 and 9 years old, who live with \nhim. He has another child from a relationship. He pays child support for this child.1  \n \n \nApplicant was employed from approximately September 2015 until May 2017, \nwhen he was laid off. He was unemployed until August 2017, when he began work at a \ncar dealership on commission. He disclosed he was also self-employed as a financial \nservices advisor from May 2017. He attributes his most recent unemployment for his \nfinancial issues.2 \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and a consolidated credit report from January 2018 \ncorroborated the SOR allegations. In his answer to the SOR, he stated that after being \nreleased from his management position, he was unable to make minimum payments on \nhis debts due to insufficient income. He also stated that when he initially opened certain \naccounts, he had no intention of defaulting on them.3  \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s response to the FORM, he explained he had previously paid his bills, \nshowing he was financially responsible. He explained that he currently has $73 a month \nto repay his delinquent debts. He intends to increase this amount to $200 in April 2019. \nAfter January 2020 he intends to increase it to $330 and in November 2021 to $500. He \nexpects all of his debts to be paid by February 2025. He provided a one-page document \nstating three steps on how to reduce debt. He provided another document listing his debts \nwith proposed minimum payments and proposed payoff dates. He did not provide \nevidence that he has made any payment or a budget showing his other expenses, \nincome, or ability to make the payments. He explained that his plan did not provide for \npotential settlement offers that would reduce the amount he would pay and expedite the \n                                                          \n1 Items 3, 4, 5. \n \n2 Items 3, 4, 5. \n \n3 Items 3, 4, 5, 6; AE A. \n\n \n3 \n \n \nprocess. He did not mention whether his proposed plan included providing for the amount \nof debt increasing due to interest.4  \n \nApplicant acknowledged the debt owed in SOR \u00b6 1.a and explained it was for a \nrepossessed vehicle, which he purchased in 2015. His car payments were $709 a month. \nWhen he lost his job, he could not afford the payments. He attempted to trade the vehicle \nin for a less costly one, but due to the negative equity, he could not. He voluntarily \nreturned the vehicle and then purchased a less expensive vehicle.5  \n \nApplicant provided a document from the IRS showing that he was entitled to \n$5,410 income tax refund. The IRS involuntarily withheld $1,855 from the refund and \napplied it to his delinquent child support debt in February 2018. It is unknown what \nApplicant did with the remainder of the refund.6  \n \n \nApplicant denied the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.e stating that neither he nor his wife \nrecognized it. It is listed on his credit report. He did not provide evidence of any action he \nmay have taken to dispute it with the creditor or on his credit report.7 \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \n                                                          \n4 AE A, C, D.  \n \n5 Items 3, 6; AE A. \n \n6 AE B. \n \n7 Items 3, 6.  \n\n \n4 \n \n \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set out \nin AG & 18:  \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n \nAG \u00b6 19 provides conditions that could raise security concerns. The following is \npotentially applicable:  \n\n \n5 \n \n \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and  \n \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \n \nApplicant has 10 delinquent debts totaling approximately $32,487. He was unable \nto pay his debts. There is sufficient evidence to support the application of the above \ndisqualifying conditions. \n \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and  \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue.  \n \n \nApplicant has numerous delinquent debts that are recent and ongoing. At this time, \nonly one debt has been paid. AG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply. \n \n \nApplicant attributed his financial problems to losing his job in May 2017. This was \nbeyond his control. Applicant has a plan to resolve his debts, but has not implimented it. \nHe did not provide evidence that he has voluntarily made payments towards any of his \ndelinquent debts. For the full application of AG \u00b6 20(b), Applicant must have acted \nresponsibly. AG \u00b6 20(b) has some application.  \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \n \nThere is no evidence Applicant has received financial counseling. Applicant \nprovided a one-page document showing three steps on how to reduce debt. No other \nevidence was provided. AG \u00b6 20(c) does not apply.  \n \n \nThe delinquent child support debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.f was satisfied through an \ninvoluntary withholding of a tax refund and application to the debt. This does not constitute \na good-faith effort to repay a debt. AG \u00b6 20(d) does not apply. The debt is resolved.  \n \n \nApplicant denies the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.e, but did not provide evidence of his action \nto dispute the debt. AG \u00b6 20(e) does not apply.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \n \n \nApplicant is 35 years old. His financial problems began when he lost his job in May \n2017. He is unable to resolve his debts at this time. Although Applicant proposed a plan \nfor how he was going to resolve his delinquent debts, he has not implemented it and has \nnot made any payments. He did not provide evidence that he contacted his creditors and \nmade payment arrangements. He did not provide evidence that he has made any \npayments towards any of his debts, except as previously noted about his child support \npayment. At this juncture, Applicant has not met his burden of persuasion. The record \nevidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability \nfor a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the \nsecurity concerns arising under Guideline F, financial considerations. \n\n \n7 \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.e: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph   1.f:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.g-1.j: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nCarol G.

Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.  \nStatement of the Case \nOn April 19, 2018, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility \n(DOD CAF) issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security \nconcerns under Guideline F, financial considerations. The action was taken under \nExecutive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \n(February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) effective on June 8, 2017. \nApplicant answered the SOR on May 12, 2018, and requested a hearing before an \nadministrative judge. The case was assigned to me on October 1, 2018. The Defense \nOffice of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing on October 12, 2018, \nscheduling the hearing for November 7, 2018. I convened the hearing as scheduled. The \n01/24/2019\n\n \n2 \n \n \nGovernment offered exhibits (GE) 1 through 3. Applicant offered Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AE) \nA and B.

They were marked AE C through H. There were no \nobjections and they were admitted into evidence and the record closed. DOHA received \nthe transcript on November 16, 2018.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant admitted both SOR allegations. After a thorough and careful review of \nthe pleadings, testimony, and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact. \n \n \nApplicant is 55 years old. He earned bachelor\u2019s degree in 1985. He married in \n1989 and divorced in 2011. His children from the marriage are ages 27, 23, 19, and 15 \nyears old. Applicant remarried in 2012. He has four adult stepchildren. Applicant has \nworked for his current employer, a federal contractor since May 2017.1  \n \n \nApplicant worked in a foreign country and was employed by a foreign company \nfrom June 2013 until March 2017. He testified that in the past, he completed his federal \nincome tax returns without assistance He testified it was difficult to file his tax returns \nwhen living in a foreign country due to the foreign tax issues. He said his employer \nprovided an attorney for him, but he was not a competent tax attorney and did not \ncomplete his obligation. Applicant further stated he did not want to file his federal tax \nreturns because he knew they would be incorrect. He believed his U.S. tax debt would be \nminimal and most of his taxes would be owed to the foreign country where he was \nworking. He explained that he was not able to get his attorney to understand the \ncomplexity of the issue. He also stated that he did not want to pay for a competent tax \nprofessional because the other one was being provided by his employer.2 \n \n \nApplicant testified that he failed to timely file his 2013 through 2016 federal income \ntax returns. He said he returned to the United States twice a year, but did not use that \nopportunity to file his tax returns. He did not seek the assistance of tax professionals \nbecause of anxiety over his tax situation. He stated he procrastinated and each year he \nignored the problem and told himself he would address the issues in in the future. He was \naware of his legal tax obligations. When he left employment in the foreign country and \nreturned to the United States in April 2017, he said he thought about filing his tax returns, \nbut failed to do promptly.3  \n \n \nApplicant completed a security clearance application (SCA) in April 2017. He was \ninterviewed by a government investigator in July 2017 and his delinquent tax returns were \ndiscussed. He completed government interrogatories in March 2018. In response to the \n                                                          \n1 Tr. 18, 24-26. \n \n2 Tr. 25-28, 35-37. \n \n3 Tr. 37-40. \n\n \n3 \n \n \ninterrogatories, he provided IRS transcripts for tax years 2013, 2014, 2015, and 2016 \nverifying he failed to file his tax returns for these years. In May 2018, he filed federal \nincome tax returns for 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016, and 2017. He provided an IRS document \nthat shows he owes $7,832 for tax year 2013. He provided a document to show he made \none payment of $500 in November 20, 2018 on that tax debt. He provided documents \nconfirming an agreement with the IRS to pay $500 a month. He provided IRS documents \nto show he did not owe taxes for the other tax years.4 \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s explanation for his failure to timely file federal income tax returns for \nmultiple years and his failure to pay foreign taxes was because his father passed away in \nJune 2013, and his father-in-law passed away in October 2015. After each death, he \nreturned to the United States. He said these trips were unexpected expenses.5  \n \n \nApplicant disclosed in his SCA that he traveled for tourism to European countries \nin May 2014, September 2014, March 2015, July 2015, November 2015, April 2016, July \n2016, August 2016, and March 2017. Applicant\u2019s wife provided a letter and noted these \nwere relatively inexpensive trips.6  \n \n \nApplicant admitted he was responsible for paying taxes in the foreign country \nwhere he was living. He explained that he did not want to file his U.S. federal income tax \nreturns because of the complexity with his foreign tax returns. He testified that he was \npaying very little toward his foreign income taxes because he had a significant child \nsupport obligation in 2013 that he was paying. He said he owed so much money that the \nUnited States would not issue him a passport. His ex-wife agreed to waive the support \nobligation if he agreed to make certain payments, which he did.7 He testified that at the \ntime his foreign taxes were not being paid. He was required to budget throughout the year \nso he could pay the taxes at the end of the tax year, but he failed to do so. At one point, \npersonnel from the foreign tax authority came to his house and made him pay 5,000\u00a3, \nwhich he did. He continued to procrastinate and did not pay his foreign taxes. He admitted \nhe paid minimal foreign taxes the years he was required to pay foreign taxes.8  \n \n \nApplicant testified that he paid approximately 33,000\u00a3 for his foreign taxes. His \nfinal two months of income, from February and March 2017 before he returned to the \nU.S., was seized by the foreign government. He said he had no money to live on during \nthis period. He went to see a new attorney in the country where he was living, who worked \n                                                          \n4 Tr. 46-55, 80-83; GE 1, 2, 3; AE A, B, C, F, G. \n \n5 Tr. 76-79. \n \n6 Tr. 78-79; GE 1; AE D. \n \n7 Applicant\u2019s child support is not an issue, except as he testified how it may impacted his ability to pay his \nforeign tax debt. I have not considered any derogatory information that was not alleged for disqualifying \npurposed. I may consider it when making a credibility determination, in applying mitigating conditions, and \nin my whole-person analysis.  \n \n8 Tr. 35-37, 40-45, 57-68, 72-76. \n\n \n4 \n \n \nwith the foreign tax authorities, so he could receive some income while living there. Once \nhe returned to the United States, Applicant testified he did not feel a sense of urgency to \nresolve the foreign tax issues. After he received the government interrogatories, he began \npursuing resolution of his foreign tax debt.9  \n \n \nApplicant testified and provided a copy of a July 2018 letter from his foreign \nattorney who requested that Applicant provide him certain information. At the time of his \nhearing, Applicant had not yet responded to the request. Part of the letter included an \naccounting of the tax balance owed by Applicant, which noted credit for amounts he \npreviously paid. The amount owed in dollars based on exchange rates from November \n2018 is approximately $142,532. In his post-hearing statement, Applicant said that he \nwas in contact with his attorney and requested that he work out a payment agreement \nwith the foreign tax authority with payments beginning in January 2019.10 \n \n \nApplicant testified that he would propose to pay $1,000 a month for ten years to \nresolve his foreign tax debt. He stated his finances are stable. Applicant\u2019s wife provided \na character letter. She provided insight into their travels and finances when they had to \nreturn to the Unites States due to family matters. She considers him to be a good and \ndevoted father.  She noted he has great respect for the law and follows the rules.11 \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility, the administrative judge \nmust consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, \nthe adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating \nconditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \n                                                          \n9 Tr. 57-68, 81-82. \n \n10 Tr. 82, 85-89; AE C; AE E is the letter dated July 19, 2018. Applicant translated the document.  \n \n11 Tr. 68-69; AE D. \n\n \n5 \n \n \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set out \nin AG & 18:  \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n \nAG \u00b6 19 provides conditions that could raise security concerns. The following are \npotentially applicable:  \n\n \n6 \n \n \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n \n \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so;  \n \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and  \n \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired.  \n \n \nApplicant failed to timely file federal income tax returns for tax years 2013 through \n2016. He is indebted to a foreign government for delinquent taxes in the approximate \namount of more than $117,000 for tax years 2013 through 2016. There is sufficient \nevidence to support the application of the above disqualifying conditions. \n \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and  \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n \n \nApplicant failed to timely file his federal income tax returns for tax years 2013 \nthrough 2016. Despite being on notice of the Government\u2019s security concerns since he \ncompleted his SCA in 2017, he did not file these tax returns until May 2018, after receiving \ngovernment interrogatories. Applicant intentionally failed to pay his foreign taxes from \n2013 through 2016, and was aware of the foreign tax debt. Foreign tax authorities came \n\n \n7 \n \n \nto his house for payment. His income was seized for two months before he left the country \nin 2017. His attorney sent Applicant a letter in July 2018, requesting that he provide \ncertain documents. At the time of the hearing, Applicant testified he had not yet responded \nto the attorney\u2019s request. Applicant\u2019s debts are ongoing and recent. AG 20(a) does not \napply.   \n \n \nApplicant indicated that because his federal income tax returns were complex due \nto the foreign tax implications, he procrastinated in completing them. He also explained \nthat as the result of two family emergencies, he failed to timely file them. I did not find \nthese factors were beyond his control due to the number of years he failed to complete \nhis tax obligations. I did not find his explanation that his attorney was not competent, and \ntherefore the situation was beyond his control. Applicant procrastinated for many years in \naddressing his domestic and foreign tax obligations. Even if these factors were beyond \nhis control, he failed to act responsibly. AG \u00b6 20(b) does not apply.   \n \n \nNo evidence was submitted to show Applicant received financial counseling. He \nhas not made payments toward his foreign tax debt. There are no clear indications that \nhis financial problems are under control. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(c) and 20(d) do not apply.  \n \n \nApplicant failed to timely file 2013 through 2016 federal income tax returns. He \nsubsequently filed these returns in May 2018. AG \u00b6 20(g) minimally applies, as he did not \nfile them until after he received the SOR. Applicant provided some evidence that he has \na foreign attorney who is working for him. However, Applicant has procrastinated in \nproviding his attorney with requested information necessary to resolve his foreign tax \ndebt. Nor has Applicant provided documents to show he has a payment plan or made any \npayments on the plan. AG\u00b6 20(g) does not apply to his foreign tax debt.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n\n \n8 \n \n \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \n \nApplicant failed to timely file his 2013 through 2016 federal income tax returns. \nDespite being aware of the security concerns, he did not file his returns until after he was \nconfronted with government interrogatories in April 2018. Applicant failed to pay his \nforeign income taxes for tax years 2013 through 2016. He left the country and did not \nresolve them. His income was seized for the last two months he lived abroad to pay his \ndelinquent taxes. He owes a significant amount of taxes to that country. He has made \nminimal efforts to resolve this debt. The DOHA Appeal Board has held that:  \n \nFailure to file tax returns suggests that an applicant has a problem with \ncomplying with well-established government rules and systems. Voluntary \ncompliance with these things is essential for protecting classified \ninformation. ISCR Case No. 14-04437 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 15, 2016). \nSomeone who fails repeatedly to fulfill his or her legal obligations does not \ndemonstrate the high degree of good judgment and reliability required of \nthose granted access to classified information. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. \n14-01894 at 5 (App. Bd. August 18, 2015). See Cafeteria & Restaurant \nWorkers Union Local 473 v. McElroy, 284 F.2d 173, 183 (D.C. Cir. 1960), \naff\u2019d, 367 U.S. 886 (1961). 12 \n \nApplicant\u2019s history of non-compliance with a fundamental legal obligation to file his \nfederal tax returns and to pay his foreign income taxes raises serious security concerns. \nThe record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and \nsuitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant failed to \nmitigate the security concerns arising under Guideline F, financial considerations.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.b: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                          \n12 ISCR Case No. 12-10933 at 3 (App. Bd. June 29, 2016). \n\n \n9 \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nCarol G.

After a thorough and careful review of all the pleadings and evidence, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant is 59 years old. He is married, but has been separated from his wife for five years. He has three children. He has worked for his current federal contractor since 2013. He has worked for other federal contractors since 1998. He served in the Air Force from 1982 to 1987. He received an honorable discharge. He has two associate\u2019s degrees.1 The personal conduct allegations raised in the SOR include: (1) In December 2016, being charged with Assault-Unlawful Force, which was later reduced to Attempted Assault (See SOR \u00b6 1.a); (2) In November 2012, being charged with Hit and Run, Duty of Driver to Stop, which was later reduced to Reckless Driving (See SOR \u00b6 1.b). The same allegations were also cross-alleged as criminal conduct concerns (See SOR \u00b6 2.a). In December 2016, Applicant had a dispute with his then-girlfriend with whom he was living at the time. The dispute started because Applicant received a phone call from an ex-girlfriend. Applicant\u2019s girlfriend demanded that he leave the home.

Karoian, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n______________ \nDecision \n______________ \nCOACHER, Robert E., Administrative Judge: \nApplicant mitigated the Government\u2019s security concerns under Guideline E, \npersonal conduct, and Guideline J, criminal conduct. Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance is granted. \nStatement of the Case \nOn June 7, 2018, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility \n(DOD CAF) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns \nunder Guideline E and Guideline J. DOD CAF acted under Executive Order (EO) \n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nadjudicative guidelines effective June 8, 2017 (AG). \nApplicant answered the SOR on September 11, 2018, and requested a hearing. \nThe case was assigned to me on October 11, 2018. The Defense Office of Hearings \n01/16/2019\n\n \n2 \n \n \nand Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing on October 18, 2018, and the hearing \nwas convened as scheduled on November 28, 2018. The Government offered exhibits \n(GE) 1 through 5, which were admitted into evidence. The Government\u2019s exhibit list was \nmarked as a hearing exhibit (HE I). Applicant testified, called two witnesses, but did not \noffer documentary evidence. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on December \n7, 2018. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer (Answer), he denied the allegations in the SOR. After a \nthorough and careful review of all the pleadings and evidence, I make the following \nfindings of fact. \n \n \nApplicant is 59 years old. He is married, but has been separated from his wife for \nfive years. He has three children. He has worked for his current federal contractor since \n2013. He has worked for other federal contractors since 1998. He served in the Air \nForce from 1982 to 1987. He received an honorable discharge. He has two associate\u2019s \ndegrees.1   \n \n \nThe personal conduct allegations raised in the SOR include: (1) In December \n2016, being charged with Assault-Unlawful Force, which was later reduced to Attempted \nAssault (See SOR \u00b6 1.a); (2) In November 2012, being charged with Hit and Run, Duty \nof Driver to Stop, which was later reduced to Reckless Driving (See SOR \u00b6 1.b). The \nsame allegations were also cross-alleged as criminal conduct concerns (See SOR \u00b6 \n2.a). \n \n \n \nIn December 2016, Applicant had a dispute with his then-girlfriend with whom he \nwas living at the time. The dispute started because Applicant received a phone call from \nan ex-girlfriend. Applicant\u2019s girlfriend demanded that he leave the home. As Applicant \nwas attempting to gather his possessions, he and his girlfriend had a physical \naltercation. She called the police, who arrived shortly thereafter. She claimed that \nApplicant grabbed her by the throat and threatened her. The police noted in their report \nthat the girlfriend was belligerent towards them and Applicant, and that Applicant \nremained calm and cooperative during their presence. Applicant claimed that his \ngirlfriend blocked his way when he attempted to gather his possessions and he pushed \nher resulting in her falling down. There were two witnesses to the altercation. Both \nverified that Applicant pushed his girlfriend to the ground to get past her. One heard a \nthreat by Applicant, but the other did not.2 \n \n \nApplicant was arrested and charged with Assault-Unlawful Force or Violence. In \nApril 2017, he appeared in court and pleaded guilty to the lesser offense of attempted \nassault. He was sentenced to 90 days of jail (suspended), a fine, and 12 months\u2019 \n                                                          \n1 Tr. 5-6, 25, 27, 32; GE 1. \n \n2 Answer; GE 5. \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \nprobation. He was also ordered to complete a domestic violence class. Applicant \nsuccessfully completed his probation and also completed a 16-week domestic violence \nprogram. He has had no further contact with his ex-girlfriend. Aside from being \nquestioned by a detective on an unrelated matter, Applicant has had no further law \nenforcement involvement since this arrest in December 2016. He reported both the \narrest and the conviction to his security officer.3 \n \n \nIn November 2012, Applicant was involved in an incident with another driver. \nApplicant hit another vehicle while attempting to pass. He did not immediately stop after \nthe incident but drove down the road for some distance. The police arrived and \nApplicant was arrested for Hit and Run and Duty of Driver to Stop offenses. Later in \n2013, the prosecutor dropped those two charges and Applicant pleaded nolo \ncontendere to Reckless Driving. He paid a fine and reported the incident to his security \nofficer.4 \n \n \nApplicant presented the testimony of two witnesses. One witness has worked \nwith Applicant for a number of years. He testified that Applicant is a valued employee \nwho handles his job with great care and diligence. He has never seen Applicant become \nviolent or aggressive in the workplace and he was in a position to observe such things if \nthey had happened. He recommended that Applicant retain his clearance.5  \n \n \nThe second witness is a friend who knows Applicant on a personal basis and has \nlived with him for the past several months. She also never observed Applicant showing \na temper.6 \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(a), the entire process is a careful weighing of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \n                                                          \n3 Tr. 28-31, 33-35; Answer; GE 3. \n \n4 Tr. 23; Answer; GE 3. \n \n5 Tr. 46-48. \n \n6 Tr. 52, 54. \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the personal conduct security concern: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. . . . \n \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case. The following disqualifying condition is potentially applicable: \n\n \n5 \n \n \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-\nperson \nassessment \nof \nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual may not \nproperly safeguard classified or sensitive information \n \nAppellant had two criminal incidents against him in 2013 and 2017. While they \nmay or may not arise to the level of criminal activity sufficient to cause concern under \nthe criminal conduct guideline, they do raise the issue of Applicant\u2019s judgment. AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n16(c) applies. \n \nI have also considered all of the mitigating conditions for personal conduct under \nAG \u00b6 17 and considered the following relevant:  \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; and  \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely \nto recur. \n \nAppellant satisfied his probation obligations from the 2016 arrest and also \ncompleted a domestic violence class, which are positive steps to alleviate future \nincidents. He no longer has contact with the victim of that incident and is arrest free \nsince that time. It is unlikely this behavior will recur and Appellant\u2019s reliability and \ntrustworthiness have not been impacted. AG \u00b6\u00b6 17(c) and 17(d) apply. \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct  \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for criminal conduct is set out in AG \n\u00b6 30: \n \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability \nor willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 31 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case. The following is potentially applicable: \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the person was formally charged, formally prosecuted or \nconvicted.  \n \nAppellant was convicted of reckless driving in 2013 and attempted assault in \n2017. AG \u00b6 31(b) applies.  \n \n \nI have also considered all of the mitigating conditions for criminal conduct under \nAG \u00b6 32 and considered the following relevant: \n \n \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment; and  \n \n \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited \nto the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \n \n \nThe most recent criminal charges against Appellant occurred in 2016 (date of \nincident) and involved a dispute with an ex-girlfriend. Police reports describe possible \nculpability by both parties. Applicant pleaded guilty to attempted assault. He \nsuccessfully completed his probation and participated in 16 domestic violence classes. \nNo repeat incidents have occurred since that time. He has had no further involvement \nwith his ex-girlfriend since his 2016 arrest. He has had no additional driving offenses \nsince the reckless driving charge in 2012. AG \u00b6\u00b6 32(a) and 32(d) apply.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.               \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I considered Applicant\u2019s military \nservice, the recommendation from his coworker, and the testimony of his friend.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude that Applicant mitigated the security concerns arising under the Guidelines. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline E:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs   1.a \u2013 1.b:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline J:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraph    2.a: \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nRobert E.

Nerney, Esq.  \n \n \n09/20/2019 \nDecision \nLEONARD, Michael H., Administrative Judge: \nApplicant contests the Defense Department\u2019s intent to deny his eligibility for \naccess to classified information. Applicant has family ties to and a financial interest in \nChina due to his marriage to a native of China who is now a U.S. citizen. He provided \nsufficient evidence to explain and mitigate the foreign influence security concern \nstemming from those ties. Accordingly, this case is decided for Applicant.    \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant completed and submitted a Standard Form (SF) 86, Questionnaire for \nNational Security Positions, the official form used for personnel security investigations, \non June 9, 2016. (Exhibit 1) This document is commonly known as a security clearance \napplication. Thereafter, on October 5, 2018, after reviewing the application and the \ninformation gathered during a background investigation, the Department of Defense \nConsolidated Adjudications Facility, Fort Meade, Maryland, sent Applicant a statement \nof reasons (SOR), explaining it was unable to find that it was clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant him eligibility for access to classified information. The SOR is \nsimilar to a complaint. It detailed the factual reasons for the action under the security \n\n \n2 \n \nguideline known as Guideline B for foreign influence due to Applicant\u2019s connections to \nChina.  \n \nWith assistance of counsel, Applicant answered the SOR on November 13, 2018. \nHis responses to the SOR were mixed, with admissions and denials, with explanations. \nHis answer consisted of a ten-page memorandum along with proposed Exhibits A-V. He \nrequested a hearing before an administrative judge.  \n  \nThe case was assigned to me on April 16, 2019. The hearing took place on June \n11, 2019. Applicant appeared with counsel. Department Counsel offered documentary \nexhibits, which were admitted as Exhibits 1-4. Applicant offered documentary exhibits, \nwhich were admitted as Exhibits A-W. I took administrative or official notice, which is \nsimilar to judicial notice, of certain facts concerning the country of China per Department \nCounsel\u2019s written request. (Exhibit 4) The essential facts about China are discussed \nbelow. Applicant called one character witness and relied on his own testimony. The \nhearing transcript (Tr.) was received on June 20, 2019. \n \nFindings of Fact1 \n \nApplicant is 52, married, and has two minor children. He is seeking to retain a \nsecurity clearance, at the secret level, which was previously granted to him. (Tr. 5-6) His \ncurrent security clearance application, submitted in June 2016, is a periodic \nreinvestigation. He works as a senior engineer for a large company in the defense \nindustry. He has been so employed since 2005. (Exhibit D) He has a good employment \nrecord, as shown by highly favorable letters of recommendation and written \nperformance evaluations. (Exhibits A, F, and H) His formal education includes a Ph.D. \nin aerospace engineering. (Exhibit E) His academic and work experience includes \nrefereed journal publications, conference presentations, conference papers, and \nindustry talks. (Exhibit D)  \n \nApplicant was born in Italy, and he lived there with his parents as a child. Both \nparents obtained employment in India in 1980, and Applicant and his brother went with \nthem. He attended high school in India at an international school providing an American \neducation. After completing high school in 1984, he applied for admission to colleges in \nthe United States. He arrived in the United States in 1984 on a student visa, and he \nearned both his bachelor\u2019s and master\u2019s degrees in aerospace engineering in 1988 and \n1989, respectively. He then took a year off to travel to India where he divided his time \nbetween his family, former high school friends, and travel in India.       \n \nApplicant returned to the United States in early 1991 to attend a Ph.D. program \nin aerospace engineering. He spent the next nine years working on his doctorate, which \nwas awarded in December 2000. This included working as a graduate research \n                                                          \n1 For ease of understanding the facts of this case, Applicant prepared a summary of key points and a \ntimeline, including an extended family tree for his Chinese relatives. (Exhibit W at 1-3) He also submitted \na biography and a resume, both of which are helpful in understanding his background and experience. \n(Exhibits C and D)  \n \n\n \n3 \n \nassistant and as a teaching assistant during 1993-2000. In about 1999 or so, he won a \nspot in the U.S. State Department\u2019s diversity visa program, which allowed him to apply \nfor and obtain status as a U.S. permanent resident. He described it as \u201can extremely \nlucky, life-changing moment.\u201d (Exhibit C at 2)   \n \nApplicant\u2019s first engineering job was with a technology company for about two \nyears during 2000-2002. It was during this time that he met his spouse. She was \nworking for the same company, was then 32, and had recently completed a Ph.D. in \nelectrical engineering from a top-notch public research university. She was then a \nChinese citizen, but had been lawfully living in the United States since 1995. (Tr. 33-34) \nAfter dating for about a year, they married in late 2002. (Exhibit U) They also relocated \nto the state where they currently live so she could accept a job with a state university, \nwhere she has been employed as a professor since 2003.   \n \nApplicant was unemployed upon their relocation until about May 2003, when he \nbegan work as a research engineer for a small company. The job required that he \nundergo an investigation for a public trust position, which was completed in 2003. \n(Exhibit 1 at 38-39). During this period of employment he obtained U.S. citizenship in \nMay 2004, and obtained a U.S. passport shortly thereafter. (Exhibit P) He had that job \nuntil December 2005, when he began his current job in the defense industry. He went \nthrough the required background investigation and was granted a security clearance for \nhis employment. He expressed a good understanding of the responsibilities and \nobligations that come with being granted access to classified information. (Tr. 66-67) \n \nIn 2005, Applicant\u2019s spouse was still a Chinese citizen as well as a U.S. \npermanent resident, and his mother-in-law and father-in-law were citizens of and \nresidents in China. Subsequently, his spouse obtained U.S. citizenship in 2008, and \nobtained a U.S. passport shortly thereafter. (Exhibit Q) Upon becoming a U.S. citizen, \nshe swore an oath of allegiance to the United States, thereby renouncing all allegiance \nand fidelity to China and any other foreign country. Unlike the United States, China does \nnot recognize dual nationality, and therefore she automatically lost, under Chinese law, \nChinese citizenship when she acquired U.S. citizenship. E.g. ISCR Case No. 18-02960 \n(May 13, 2019) at 3 n. 3.  \n \nAfter the birth of their second child, Applicant and his spouse decided they \nneeded help managing two jobs and two small children. His spouse completed the \nnecessary paperwork to sponsor her parents to immigrate to the United States, which \nthey did in 2010. They have been U.S. permanent residents since April 2010. (Exhibits \nR and S) They initially lived in Applicant\u2019s household for a couple of years until Applicant \nand his wife purchased a home for them. Applicant and his wife jointly own the home, \nthey make the monthly payments on the mortgage loan, and they pay the regular living \nexpenses incurred by her parents. (Tr. 72-73)   \n \nApplicant\u2019s spouse has progressed through the rank of assistant professor, \nassociate professor, and is now a full professor. She is an accomplished and well-\nregarded academic, as shown by the highly favorable letters of recommendation \nsubmitted by a fellow professor in the same department as well as the professor who \n\n \n4 \n \nserves as the department head. (Exhibit B) The department head has not observed any \nactivities that might indicate that she has preference for China over the United States, \nand believes that she and Applicant have established a completely normal and \nproductive life. (Exhibit B at 2-3) Applicant\u2019s spouse has more than 200 journal and \nconference publications, and she has been recognized for numerous professional \nachievements. For example, she received the Presidential Early Career Award for \nScientists and Engineers, which was presented at The White House. (Exhibit I)  \n \nApplicant\u2019s spouse completed work on two occasions in 2014 and 2016 on behalf \nof a research organization in Hong Kong. The work was considered part of her duties to \nincrease the international visibility of her department and the university. (Exhibit B at 2-\n3) The work was on an ad hoc basis, and she was never a permanent member or \nemployee of the organization. On both occasions, she evaluated research funding \nproposals submitted to the organization; her work was performed within the United \nStates without having to travel to foreign locations; and the work was completed through \nwritten/electronic communication. (Exhibit B at 2-3) Applicant explained the proposals \ninvolved open literature material that can be found in trade journals, similar to proposals \nsubmitted to the National Science Foundation or the National Institute for Health here in \nthe United States. (Tr. 38) She received an honorarium on each occasion from the \norganization for her work. Applicant described the payments as minimal, guessing $500 \nto $800. (Tr. 37-38) Applicant searched for and submitted the e-mails related to the two \nproposals, and they appear to be normal academic research matters. (Exhibit V) The e-\nmails indicate the work for the 2014 proposal resulted in an honorarium of $146. (Exhibit \nV at 4) Applicant also stated that she has routinely reviewed such proposals for \norganizations in the United States. (Tr. 39-40)  \n \nApplicant\u2019s mother-in-law and father-in-law were lifelong residents of China until \nthey immigrated to the United States in 2010. Both are retired university professors. His \nfather-in-law is 80 years old, and his mother-in-law is 76 years old. Applicant has weekly \nto monthly contact with his parents-in-law; the contact was more frequent when \nchildcare was involved. (Tr. 42) He indicated that, because he does not speak Mandarin \nand they do not speak English well, conversations with his in-laws are limited to the \nusual pleasantries, as their primary focus is on their daughter and their two \ngrandchildren. (Tr. 42-43) His spouse has more frequent contact with her parents, as \nshe takes them shopping, to medical appointments, and to other appointments due to \ntheir advanced age and limited English-language skills.  \n \nBefore their careers as university professors, Applicant\u2019s mother-in-law and \nfather-in-law experienced difficulties under the Chinese government. His father-in-law \nwas required to join the Communist Party and serve in the military as a means to \nsafeguard his family from starvation during the Great Chinese Famine of 1958-1961. \nHis mother-in-law spent about eight years (1967-1975) in a labor or re-education camp \nfor anti-communist activities. Applicant\u2019s spouse was conceived during a conjugal visit, \nand her mother was temporarily paroled or released from the labor camp to give birth in \n1969. After the mother\u2019s return to the labor camp, the maternal grandmother was the \nprimary caregiver to Applicant\u2019s spouse. As a result, Applicant\u2019s spouse had a close \nrelationship to her maternal grandmother.  \n\n \n5 \n \nThe maternal grandmother and grandfather were successful business people in \nChina and managed to accumulate financial assets. (Tr. 69-70) The maternal \ngrandfather passed away many years ago. Applicant described the maternal \ngrandmother as \u201ca smart lady\u201d who was able to rebuild the family\u2019s wealth once the \nChinese government introduced their form of market capitalism. The maternal \ngrandmother passed away in 2012 leaving her estate to her three surviving children, \none of whom is Applicant\u2019s mother-in-law. The surviving children have apparently \ndecided to pass that wealth directly to their children, one of whom is Applicant\u2019s spouse. \n(Tr. 74-75) Applicant explained that his in-laws decided to gift their share of the \ninheritance to Applicant and his spouse with the understanding they would take care of \ntheir in-laws\u2019 needs in the United States. (Exhibit 2 at 29)  \n \nAlthough the term \u201cinheritance\u201d is used throughout this decision to describe the \nmoney received by Applicant and his spouse, and the term was used in the same \nmanner during the hearing, the actual heir to the inheritance is the mother-in-law, not \nApplicant\u2019s spouse. The money gifted to Applicant and his spouse is a form of an early \ninheritance.  \n \nDisbursement of the inheritance began in August 2013, the first tranche \nconsisting of a cash transfer from a Chinese bank in the amount of about $60,000, or \n$30,000 per person between Applicant and his spouse. (Exhibit W at 8; Exhibit 2 at 34-\n42) In 2014, a total of $139,970 in three deposits was transferred ($69,985 per person); \nin 2015, a total of $179,940 in four deposits ($89,970 per person); in 2016, a total of \n$179,940 ($89,970 per person); and in 2017, a total of $49,970 in two deposits of which \n$9,985 was a gift from a family member unrelated to the inheritance ($24,985 per \nperson). The cash transfers were made by Applicant\u2019s mother-in-law\u2019s sister and \nbrother as well as other family members. Applicant believes an additional $700,000 \nremains in China as well as two residential properties, which have been difficult to sell. \n(Exhibit W at 1; Tr. 58-59) The financial assets are essentially controlled by his mother-\nin-law\u2019s sister and brother in China. The cash transfers are at their discretion as to when \nthe funds are released and in what amounts.     \n \nAs a matter of general U.S. tax law, a cash inheritance from an individual\u2019s estate \nis not subject to federal income tax. The same is true for a gift of cash. Applicant \nunderstands that U.S. tax law allows for non-taxable gifts from a nonresident alien \nperson or a foreign estate up to an amount of U.S. $100,000 per person per year to \nU.S. permanent residents and citizens. (Exhibit 2 at 33; Exhibit W at 5) If the amount is \n$100,000 or less, there is no reporting requirement to the IRS, but receipt of more than \n$100,000 requires the filing of IRS Form 3520, annual return to report transactions with \nforeign trusts and receipt of certain foreign gifts. (Exhibit W at 5) Accordingly, the only \nguidance Applicant and his spouse have provided is that the cash transfers should be \nless than $100,000 per person annually in order to avoid the IRS reporting requirement.  \n \nApplicant reported the inheritance to his employer\u2019s facility security officer (FSO) \nin June 2014 after receiving the first tranche of the inheritance in August 2013. (Exhibit \n2 at 32-33) At the time, the intention was for the money to be given directly to \nApplicant\u2019s two children through a U.S. trust for their future use, but they subsequently \n\n \n6 \n \nlearned that a minor cannot control a trust. Instead, the money is held in a family trust \nestablished by Applicant and his spouse in 2008. (Exhibit O) The trust is a revocable \nliving trust and their two children are the beneficiaries. In addition to self-reporting the \ninheritance to the FSO, Applicant disclosed the subject in his June 2016 security \nclearance application. (Exhibit 1) He further disclosed the sponsorship of his parents-in-\nlaw to immigrate to the United States, and he disclosed his spouse\u2019s work for the \nresearch organization in Hong Kong. He provided additional information and financial \ndocuments about the inheritance and the cash transfers in response to written \ninterrogatories. (Exhibit 2)   \n \nApplicant and his spouse consider the inheritance to be a windfall. (Tr. 61, 65, \n67). Their annual household income of about $240,000 is more than sufficient to meet \ntheir financial needs and cover the living expenses for his mother-in-law and father-in-\nlaw. (Tr. 64) Although they do not need the additional money the inheritance provides, \nApplicant and his spouse decided to accept it so the money is here rather than in China. \nGiven the history of mistreatment of his mother-in-law and father-in-law, Applicant \nunderstands they are motivated to remove as many financial assets from China as \npossible. (Exhibit 2 at 29) He realized it might raise an issue with his security clearance, \nbut he also realized the inheritance is a sizeable amount of money that most people \nwould not turn away. (Tr. 61) Nevertheless, Applicant was unequivocal in stating that he \nand his spouse are prepared to forgo the additional assets in China if required by the \ncircumstances. (Tr. 81-82)  \n \nThe inheritance money is held in the family trust\u2019s accounts with a bank and a \ncredit union. (Exhibit K) As of August 31, 2018, the savings and checking accounts with \nthe bank had a total balance of about $368,184. And as of August 30, 2018, the savings \nand checking account with the credit union had a total balance of about $212,347. \nApplicant estimated their net worth at about $1 million to $1.5 million. (Tr. 63-64, 85; \nExhibit W at 4) Their personal residence, which they bought in 2003, was paid off in \nNovember 2015. (Exhibit M) They have three joint investment accounts, a 401(k) \naccount with Applicant\u2019s employer, and a health savings account for a total amount of \nabout $192,327 as of September 30, 2018. (Exhibit L) They also own two parcels of \nland in their state of residence.

(Tr. 73-74)  \n \nConcerning the country of China, Department Counsel\u2019s request for \nadministrative notice contains an extensive discussion of the security concerns \nassociated with China. The most pertinent of those facts are the following: (1) China is \nan authoritarian state in which the Chinese Communist Party is the paramount authority; \n(2) China (along with Russia) is the most aggressive collector of intelligence (both \nindustrial and military) related to U.S. information and technology; and (3) China has a \npoor record of human rights regarding respect for the integrity of the person, respect for \ncivil liberties, respect for political rights, corruption and lack of transparency in \ngovernment, worker rights, as well as discrimination, societal abuses, and human \ntrafficking. The maltreatment and oppression of the people in Tibet is but one example \nof China\u2019s poor human-rights record.  \n\n \n7 \n \nLaw and Policies \n \n \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (E.O.) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of \nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the National Security \nAdjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or \nEligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AG), effective June 8, 2017. \n \nIt is well-established law that no one has a right to a security clearance.2 As \nnoted by the Supreme Court in Department of the Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe clearly consistent \nstandard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the \nside of denials.\u201d3 Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive, any doubt \nabout whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified information will be \nresolved in favor of protecting national security. In Egan, the Supreme Court stated that \nthe burden of proof is less than a preponderance of evidence.4 The DOHA Appeal \nBoard has followed the Court\u2019s reasoning, and a judge\u2019s findings of fact are reviewed \nunder the substantial-evidence standard.5 \n \n \nThere is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for \naccess to classified information.6 Under the Directive, the parties have the following \nburdens: (1) Department Counsel has the burden of presenting evidence to establish \nfacts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted; (2) an applicant is responsible for \npresenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts that have been \nadmitted or proven; and (3) an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain \na favorable clearance decision.7 \n \nDiscussion \n \n \nThe gravamen of the SOR under Guideline B for foreign influence is whether \nApplicant\u2019s connections to China should disqualify him from access to classified \ninformation. Under Guideline B for foreign influence, the suitability of an applicant may \nbe questioned or put into doubt due to foreign contacts and interests. The overall \nconcern under the guideline is set forth in AG \u00b6 6 as follows: \n \n                                                          \n2 Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988) (\u201cit should be obvious that no one has a \n\u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance\u201d); Duane v. Department of Defense, 275 F.3d 988, 994 (10th Cir. 2002) (no \nright to a security clearance).  \n \n3 484 U.S. at 531. \n \n4 484 U.S. at 531. \n \n5 ISCR Case No. 01-20700 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002) (citations omitted).  \n \n6 ISCR Case No. 02-18663 (App. Bd. Mar. 23, 2004). \n \n7 Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.14 and E3.1.15. \n \n\n \n8 \n \nForeign contacts and interests, including but not limited to business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they \nresult in divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern \nif they create circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to \npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign \ncontacts and interests should consider the country in which the foreign \ncontact or interest is located, including, but not limited to, considerations \nsuch as whether it is known to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or \nsensitive information or is associated with a risk of terrorism. \n \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise a security concern under \nAG \u00b6 7. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n \nAG \u00b6 7(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, \nbusiness or professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen \nof or resident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk \nof foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion;  \n \nAG \u00b6 7(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country \nthat create a potential conflict of interest between the individual's \nobligation to protect classified or sensitive information or technology and \nthe individual's desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by \nproviding that information or technology; and \n \nAG \u00b6 7(f) substantial business, financial, or property interests in a foreign \ncountry, or in any foreign-owned or foreign-operated business that could \nsubject the individual to a heightened risk of foreign influence or personal \nconflict of interest.  \n \n \nThe starting point for the analysis is the country of China. Suffice it to say, the \nU.S. Government views the behavior of the Chinese government as presenting a \nserious national security concern. That is sufficient to meet the heightened-risk \nstandard.  \n \n \nConcerning Applicant\u2019s connections to China, the SOR alleges he has family ties \nto China based on his spouse\u2019s dual citizenship with the United States and China as \nwell as the Chinese citizenship of his mother-in-law and father-in-law. In addition, the \nSOR alleges his spouse\u2019s connections to China via her work for the research \norganization in Hong Kong. First, Applicant\u2019s spouse is no longer a citizen of China \nbecause China does not recognize dual nationality, and her citizenship is exclusively \nwith the United States. His spouse\u2019s citizenship status does not present any concern. \nSecond, the Chinese citizenship of his mother-in-law and father-in-law and his spouse\u2019s \nwork on two proposals in 2014 and 2016 for the research organization in Hong Kong \nare sufficient to raise the disqualifying conditions in AG \u00b6 7(a) and AG \u00b6 7(b). \n \n\n \n9 \n \n \nThe SOR also alleges in two separate allegations the receipt of funds from the \ninheritance based in China. The two allegations were treated as one during the hearing \nbecause it is the same matter based on the same facts and circumstances. The receipt \nof the funds from the inheritance (about $600,000 during 2013-2017 with the potential \nfor another $700,000 or so) from China, a country that raises a heightened risk for \nforeign influence, is sufficient to raise the disqualifying condition in AG \u00b6 7(f).  \n \n \nThe guideline provides that certain facts and circumstances may mitigate foreign \ninfluence concerns. Given the evidence here, I considered the following mitigating \nconditions:  \n \nAG \u00b6 8(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country \nin which these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nUnited States;  \n \nAG \u00b6 8(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s \nsense of loyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the \ngroup, government, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such \ndeep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, \nthat the individual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in \nfavor of the U.S. interest; and  \n \nAG \u00b6 8(f) the value or routine nature of the foreign business, financial, or \nproperty interests is such that they are unlikely to result in a conflict and \ncould not be used effectively to influence, manipulate, or pressure the \nindividual.  \n \n \nChina\u2019s relationship with the United States and the heightened risk it presents \nplace a heavy burden on Applicant to mitigate the security concern. With that said, \nApplicant has multiple indicators of a mature, stable, responsible, and trustworthy \nperson. He was serious, candid, and credible at the hearing. He has cooperated fully \nand provided truthful information throughout the security clearance process. He made a \ngood impression upon me during the hearing. I have considered the totality of \nApplicant\u2019s connections to China via his marriage to a native of China. Overall, he \nprovided sufficient evidence to explain and mitigate the foreign influence security \nconcern stemming from those connections. The rationale is set forth below.  \n \n \nTo begin, Applicant came to the United States about 35 years ago as a college \nstudent. He is now wholly invested in the United States, as established by his record of \nformal education and his work history in the United States. In addition, he met and \nmarried his spouse in the United States, and they have two native-born U.S. citizen \nchildren. Before 2013 when the receipt of the Chinese inheritance began, he and his \nspouse\u2019s financial interests were exclusively in the United States. The inheritance is not \na minor matter. It is a substantial amount of money. More to the point, Applicant and his \n\n \n10 \n \nspouse consider the inheritance to be a windfall. As such, they are willing to forgo the \nreceipt of any additional funds without an adverse impact on their overall financial \nsituation.  \n \n \nApplicant has also been transparent and forthcoming about the inheritance. He \ninitially reported the subject to his company\u2019s FSO in June 2014, which was within \nmonths of receipt of the first tranche of funds in August 2013. And he provided \nadditional information during the security clearance process. By self-reporting the \ninheritance, Applicant did exactly what is expected of a person who is currently eligible \nfor access to classified information. See Directive, Enclosure 2, \u00b6 2(f). His self-reporting \nput the Government on notice and allowed the Government to put the matter under \nscrutiny. His willingness to self-report the inheritance strongly suggests he would be \nwillingly to report any potential security infraction or violation or other matters that may \nbe contrary to his self-interest.  \n \n \nThe cash transfers occur through banking channels. The money is deposited in \nthe family trust\u2019s accounts held by U.S. financial institutions. Applicant has been careful \nto ensure compliance with any reporting requirements mandated by the IRS. The cash \ntransfers will end when the mother-in-law\u2019s share of the inheritance has been fully \ndisbursed. There is no evidence that the cash transfers are contrary to U.S. law, and \nDepartment Counsel made no such argument. Overall, the cash transfers appear to be \na normal way for an inheritance located in a foreign country, in this case China, to be \ndisbursed to an heir in the United States. Given the circumstances, the mitigating \ncondition at AG \u00b6 8(f) applies because the financial interest at issue here, an \ninheritance, despite its substantial size, is of a routine nature that is unlikely to pose a \nconflict, and it is unlikely to be used to influence, manipulate, or pressure Applicant.  \n \n \nConcerning family ties to China, there have been changes since Applicant was \nfavorably adjudicated for a security clearance more than a decade ago. First, Applicant \nand his spouse have had more time to develop their ties and connections to the United \nStates. Their ties and connections are deep, including their respective careers as \nengineers, in which they are both accomplished and successful, and their two native-\nborn U.S. citizen children. He has also successfully held a security clearance and \nadhered to security rules and requirements for his employment with a defense \ncontractor. Second, his spouse, a full professor at a state university, is now a U.S. \ncitizen and no longer a citizen of China. Third, his parents-in-law, while still Chinese \ncitizens, are now living in the United States as lawful permanent residents. Their \npresence here adds an additional degree of separation from the potential for undue \ninfluence exerted by the Chinese government.    \n \n \nIn addition, Applicant\u2019s spouse\u2019s work in reviewing funding proposals on two \noccasions for the research organization in Hong Kong is not unusual or troubling. Nor is \nthe work part of an ongoing employment relationship or contractual arrangement. The \nwork was done on an ad hoc basis. It is the type of work that is common and expected \nof a university professor in an engineering department. The work was not financially \nlucrative, she was paid an honorarium. And the work was done here in the United \nStates, with no travel to Hong Kong or in-person interaction with Chinese officials.  \n\n \n11 \n \n \nGiven the totality of facts and circumstances, I conclude that it is unlikely \nApplicant will be placed in a position of having to choose between the interests of the \nUnited States and the interests of the Chinese government or family members who \nhave Chinese citizenship or residence. I further conclude there is no conflict of interest, \nbecause Applicant has developed such deep and long-standing relationships and \nloyalties in the United States that he can be expected to resolve any potential conflict of \ninterest in the favor of the United States. Overall, I am persuaded that Applicant and his \nspouse are good people who are doing good things that benefit the United States, and \ntheir interests are aligned with the interests of the United States. AG \u00b6 8(a) is partially \napplicable. AG \u00b6 8(b) is applicable.  \n \n \n \nFollowing Egan and the clearly consistent standard, I have no doubts or \nconcerns about Applicant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, good judgment, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. In reaching this conclusion, I weighted the \nevidence as a whole and considered if the favorable evidence outweighed the \nunfavorable evidence or vice versa. I also considered the whole-person concept. \nAccordingly, I conclude that he met his ultimate burden of persuasion to show that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant his eligibility for access to classified \ninformation.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nThe formal findings on the SOR allegations are: \n \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:  \n \nFor Applicant  \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.f:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIt is clearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant \neligibility for access to classified information.

Applicant transferred over 93,000 files containing \nproprietary information to personal storage devices in the weeks before he started a job \nat a competing company. He then made false statements to his former employer during \nthe investigation of the issue. Clearance is denied.      \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nThe Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudication Facility (DOD CAF) \nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under the use of \ninformation technology (IT) and personal conduct guidelines on May 2, 2018. The DOD \nCAF took this action under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry, signed by President Eisenhower on February 20, 1960, as \namended; as well as DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program, dated January 2, 1992, as amended (Directive), and the \nAdjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information, \nimplemented on June 8, 2017. Based on the available information, DOD adjudicators \nwere unable to find that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant \nApplicant\u2019s security clearance and recommended that the case be submitted to an \n\n \n2 \n \nadministrative judge for a determination whether to revoke or deny Applicant\u2019s security \nclearance.  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on May 21, 2018, and requested a decision without \na hearing. The Government submitted its written case on March 11, 2019. A complete \ncopy of the file of relevant material (FORM) and the Directive were provided to \nApplicant. He received the FORM on March 15, 2019, and provided a response. The \nattachments to the FORM are admitted to the record as Government\u2019s Exhibits (GE) GE \n1 through 11, and Applicant\u2019s response to the FORM is admitted as Applicant\u2019s Exhibit \n(AE) A, without objection.   \n \n  Findings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant, 60, has worked for his current employer, Company A, a federal \ncontracting company, since March 2016. He worked for his previous employer, \nCompany B, another federal contracting company, for 31 years from 1988 until \nFebruary 2016 when he was ordered to resign in lieu of termination. On February 23, \n2016, Company B filed an adverse information report in the Joint Adjudication \nPersonnel System (JPAS), alerting the DOD CAF that Applicant attempted to retain \nCompany B propriety information related to his employment without authorization, and \nthat he made deliberately false statements to a Company B investigator. Applicant \ncompleted a security clearance application in August 2016, disclosing that he was \ndisciplined by Company B for having \u201cbackup disks that contained company proprietary \ninformation.\u201d He disclosed that after resigning and providing two-weeks\u2019 notice, that \nCompany B released him two days early, informing him by letter after the fact that he  \nresigned in lieu of termination. According to the August 2016 security clearance \napplication, the DOD granted Applicant security clearance eligibility in 2013. It is unclear \nfrom the record if he held security clearance eligibility before 2013. (AE 4-5.)  \n \n \nIn February 2016, Applicant accepted an offer of employment from Company A. \nHe tendered his resignation to Company B on February 18, 2016. Following internal \nprotocol, the facility security officer (FSO) informed Company B\u2019s counterintelligence \ngroup that Applicant was going to work for a competitor, Company A, in a position in the \nsame technology area. After determining that Applicant had critical intellectual property \nknowledge and access, the counterintelligence group performed a due-diligence review \nto identify the movement of any Company B data to external media or non-Company B \nemail addresses. The review revealed that Applicant transferred over 93,000 Company \nB files, including 25,000 related to a project that Applicant worked on between 1994 and \n2013, to two personal storage devices. While it is unclear when Applicant started \ntransferring these files, Company B noted that 48,600 of the files were transferred \nbetween January and February 2016. The downloaded information included Company \nB proprietary information, both technical and business-related, foreign military \ninformation, and sensitive, unclassified DOD program information. Company B \ndetermined that use or disclosure of the information by Applicant could cause potential \nloss of competitive advantage to Company B and could cause potential damage to U.S. \ninterests. (GE 5-6, 10-11.) \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \nOn February 19, 2016, a Company B counterintelligence investigator interviewed \nApplicant. The FSO and a human resources representative were also present for the \ninterview. At the beginning of the interview, the investigator had Applicant review \nCompany B\u2019s policy regarding the ownership and protection of proprietary information, \nas well as Company\u2019s B policy on internal investigations. According to the investigative \nreport, Applicant signed an acknowledgement certifying that he did not retain any \nCompany B proprietary information. During the interview, Applicant repeatedly denied \ntransferring Company B data to personal devices, even when asked about the specific \ndevices he used. He admitted transferring the files only after the investigator confronted \nhim with direct evidence. He explained that the downloaded files represented his life\u2019s \nwork and that he wanted to have it available to him in his role at Company A for \npersonal reference only. (GE 7-10.) \n \n \nAt Company B\u2019s direction, Applicant retrieved the two storage devices from his \nhome and surrendered them for examination. He was then placed on administrative \nleave pending a forensic review of the devices and a decision from management on \nhow to handle the situation. A forensic review of the devices revealed that Applicant \ntransferred over 200,000 files, the majority of which belonged to Company B, including \nover 25,000 related to a specific program. The forensic review also seemed to suggest \nApplicant was transferring data to personal devices as early as 2012. (GE 7-10.) \n \n \nThe investigation confirmed that Applicant transferred Company B proprietary \nand sensitive data to personal devices in violation of the company\u2019s IT policy regarding \nthe introduction  and storage of Company B data on unauthorized devices. On February \n24, 2016, Company B issued Applicant an order requiring his immediate resignation in \nlieu of termination. Company B also sent a letter to Company A informing them of \nApplicant\u2019s actions and to place Company A on notice not to make use of any Company \nB proprietary information provided to them by Applicant. Company B referred the matter \nto the FBI for further investigation. The FBI referred the case to the U.S. Attorney\u2019s \nOffice, seeking a warrant to search Applicant\u2019s home for additional materials and for \nprosecution under 18 U.S.C. \u00b6 1832, \u201cTheft of Trade Secrets.\u201d The U.S. Attorney\u2019s office \ndeclined to pursue the case. (GE 10-11.) \n \n \nApplicant admits he lied during the Company B interview, but denies he \ndownloaded the files for any nefarious purposes. In his response to the FORM, \nApplicant explained that he began blindly backing up all of his professional files in 2000 \nto preserve the work he generated for his personal use. He lied during the Company B \ninterview because he was scared. Applicant considers himself an honest person who \nexhibited extremely poor judgment in violating Company B\u2019s policies. He vows not to \nviolate his employer\u2019s rules in the future. (GE 3-4; AE A.) \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \n\n \n4 \n \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nAnalysis \n \n \nThe record establishes that Applicant engaged in disqualifying conduct under the \nuse of information technology and personal conduct guidelines. Applicant engaged in \nconduct that raises concerns about his ability to handle and protect sensitive and \nclassified information and his ability to follow rules and regulations. His misconduct also \nhighlights concerns about his judgment, trustworthiness and reliability. (See AG \u00b6\u00b6 39 \nand 15).  \n \n \nApplicant violated his employer\u2019s IT policy relating to the introduction and storage \nof Company B data on unauthorized devices. (AG \u00b6 40(e)). An internal investigation \nrevealed that from as early as 2012 to February 2016, Applicant transferred over \n200,000 files containing Company B\u2019s proprietary or other protected information onto \n\n \n5 \n \ntwo unauthorized personal storage devices. (AG \u00b6\u00b6 40(d)). This conduct is particularly \negregious given that Applicant transferred approximately 48,600 files, the month before \nhe tendered his resignation at Company B to begin employment with Company A, a \nknown competitor. In addition to improperly transferring files to personal storage \ndevices, Applicant deliberately provided false statements to the Company B investigator \nuntil after being confronted with evidence of his misconduct. (AG \u00b6 16(b)). \n \n \nNone of the use of IT systems or personal conduct mitigating conditions apply. \nApplicant describes himself as an honest person who exhibited bad judgment. The \nrecord does not support this characterization. Applicant claims that his motive was \nbenign, to preserve what he considered his \u201clife\u2019s work,\u201d but the vast number of files he \ndownloaded before tendering his resignation to work for a competitor casts doubt on \nthat motive. Applicant\u2019s disregard of Company B\u2019s IT policy was not a minor, isolated \nexercise of poor judgment. He engaged in intentional misconduct to preserve his self-\ninterest at the potential detriment to his employer and U.S. interests. Furthermore, \nApplicant failed to provide truthful and candid answers during the Company B \ninvestigation. Applicant\u2019s statements regarding his actions on his August 2016 security \nclearance application were in line with his conduct during the Company B internal \ninvestigation. Applicant offered enough information to convey an adverse employment \naction. However, the disclosure did not relate the actual misconduct and minimized the \nnature and extent of it.  \n \n \nBased on the record, doubts remain about Applicant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, \ngood judgment, and ability to protect classified or sensitive information. In reaching this \nconclusion, I have also considered the whole-person factors enumerated in AG \u00b6 2(d). \nApplicant has worked for federal contracting companies for over 30 years. He \nundoubtedly understood the importance of handling and safeguarding proprietary, \nsensitive, and classified information and chose to disregard his obligation to do so. The \npurpose of the security clearance adjudication is to make \u201can examination of a sufficient \nperiod of a person\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the person is an \nacceptable security risk.\u201d (AG \u00b6 2(d)). Applicant violated his employer\u2019s policies and \npotentially risked U.S. interests to advance his self-interests. Furthermore, he has \ndemonstrated that he cannot be relied upon to admit, let alone self-report adverse \ninformation. Applicant\u2019s conduct creates a security risk that must be resolved in favor of \nthe government.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nThe formal findings on the SOR allegations are: \n \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline M:  \n \nAgainst Applicant  \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \nAgainst Applicant  \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n\n \n6 \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant access to \nclassified information.

However, he \nmitigated the financial concern by demonstrating that he acted responsibly under the \ncircumstances and by resolving the majority of the delinquent debt. Eligibility for access \nto classified information is granted. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (e-QIP) on July 16, 2017. On \nMay 4, 2018, the Department of Defense (DOD) sent him a Statement of Reasons (SOR), \nalleging security concerns under Guideline F. The DOD acted under Executive Order \n(E.O.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), \nas amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance \nReview Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative \nguidelines implemented by DOD on June 8, 2017.  \n \nApplicant initially answered the SOR on May 22, 2018, wherein he failed to admit \nor deny one of the allegations, and requested a hearing before an administrative judge. \n                                                              \n\n \n2\nIn response to a request from the DOD, Applicant filed a supplemental answer to the SOR \non June 1, 2018. Department Counsel was ready to proceed on July 3, 2018, and the \ncase was assigned to me on January 30, 2019. On April 3, 2019, the Defense Office of \nHearings and Appeals (DOHA) notified Applicant that the hearing was scheduled for April \n23, 2019. I convened the hearing as scheduled. Government Exhibits (GX) 1 through 7 \nwere admitted into evidence without objection. Applicant testified and I left the record \nopen until May 7, 2019, to enable Applicant to submit documentary evidence. DOHA \nreceived the transcript (Tr.) on May 2, 2019. \n \nProcedural Issue \n \n \nAt the hearing, Department Counsel moved to amend the SOR by striking SOR \u00b6 \n1.i as a duplicate of the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.e. I allowed the amendment without \nobjection. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant filed Chapter 7 bankruptcy in September 2005 \nwhich was discharged in December 2005; Chapter 13 bankruptcy in June 2016 which \nwas dismissed in September 2016; and, Chapter 13 bankruptcy in 2016 which was \ndismissed in January 2017. The SOR further alleges that Applicant was $18,695 in \narrears on his past-due mortgage loan, and had seven delinquent consumer accounts \ntotaling $6,387. Applicant admits each of the SOR allegations. The bankruptcies and \ndebts are reflected in records from the bankruptcy court and Applicant\u2019s credit bureau \nreports (CBR) from April 2019, March 2018, and August 2017. (GX 2 \u2013 GX 7.) His \nadmissions in his Answer are incorporated in my findings of fact.   \n \nApplicant is a 52-year-old creative writer currently employed by a defense \ncontractor since July 2017, and periodically employed in the defense industry since 2005. \nHe served honorably on active duty in the U.S. Navy from October 1985 to June 2000 \nand in the Reserve from June 2000 until October 2005. He was briefly recalled to active \nduty in 2001. Applicant received his bachelor\u2019s degree in 1995. He and his current wife \nmarried in 2010. Applicant was previously married from 1988 until 1999. He has three \nchildren ages 28, 21, and 18. The 21-year-old and 18-year-old reside with Applicant and \nhis wife. Applicant received his first security clearance in 1985 while on active duty. His \nsecurity clearance was revoked for financial issues following his Chapter 7 bankruptcy in \napproximately 2005. This is his first re-application for a security clearance. (GX 1; Tr. 28-\n33; Tr. 35.)  \n \nApplicant left active duty in 2000 and joined the Reserve. He was activated from \nDecember 2001 until June 2002. He was unemployed from June 2002 until July 2003. \nThis period of unemployment ultimately led to Applicant\u2019s filing Chapter 7 bankruptcy in \nSeptember 2005. After filing, Applicant voluntarily participated in financial counseling and \nregained his financial footing until 2012 when he was laid off from his federal contracting \nposition. (Tr. 51.) He was unemployed between March 2012 and July 2012. Applicant \nwas underemployed as a pizza delivery driver earning approximately $18,000 a year from \n\n \n3\nJuly 2012 until July 2017, when he started his current job. Initially, he worked both jobs, \nbut the schedule was too demanding for him to maintain it. (Tr. 27.) Applicant\u2019s wife is \nunable to work outside the home due to a medical condition. She sells handcrafted items \nwhich sporadically produces less than $100 a month. (Tr. 39.) \n \nApplicant purchased a house in February 2011. Following his layoff in 2012 and \nthe subsequent extended period of underemployment, Applicant was unable to sustain \nhis financial obligations. He defaulted on his mortgage loan in May 2015 and foreclosure \nproceedings were subsequently started by the lender. After consulting with an attorney, \nApplicant filed Chapter 13 bankruptcy in June 2016 to prevent losing his house in \nforeclosure. He was unable to maintain the payments and his case was dismissed in \nSeptember 2016. He re-filed the bankruptcy in September 2016, but was again unable to \nsustain the payments and the case was dismissed in January 2017. At some point in \n2016, Applicant and the mortgage-loan lender reached a mortgage-loan reorganization \nagreement. Applicant has been paying down his mortgage-loan arrearage (SOR \u00b6 1.d) \nand the current balance is approximately $2,000. He has made timely mortgage-loan \npayments since reaching the agreement. (GX 7.) All of the other SOR debts became \ndelinquent between May 2012 and January 2017. (GX 5; GX 6; GX 8; GX 3; GX 4; Tr. \n36-37; Tr. 41-46.)  \n \n \n  Applicant disputed in person and by telephone the $200 cable television debt \nalleged in SOR \u00b6 1.l. and it is not listed on his April 2019 CBR. He has not been contacted \nrecently by any of the SOR creditors. Of the remaining SOR debts totaling $6,187, only \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e and 1.h, totaling $1,728 are listed on his April 2019 CBR. (GX 7.)  \n \nAll of Applicant\u2019s SOR debts were incurred prior to Applicant\u2019s current employment, \nwhich began in July 2017. (GX 4.) Applicant lives within his means, has not incurred any \nrecent delinquent debts, and is able to maintain his ongoing financial obligations. He and \nhis wife maintain a monthly budget and timely file their tax returns. Applicant intends to \ncontinue to maintain control of his finances. (Tr. 51-53; Tr. 57.) He was sincere and \ncredible while testifying. \n \nPolicies \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended.  \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant\u2019s meeting the \ncriteria contained in the AG. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, \nrecognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies these \n\n \n4\nguidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available and reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. Or. \n10865 \u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the \napplicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense \nhave established for issuing a clearance. \n \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 92-1106 at 3, \n1993 WL 545051 at *3 (App. Bd. Oct. 7, 1993).  \n \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \n \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n5\nAnalysis \n \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18:  \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended \nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \n \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified \ninformation. See ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \n \n \n The record evidence establishes that disqualifying conditions AG \u00b6 19(a): inability \nto satisfy debts; and AG \u00b6 19(c): a history of not meeting financial obligations apply. \n \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \nAG \u00b6 20(e):  the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy \nof the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s past financial problems were attributable to matters largely beyond his \ncontrol. Specifically, he experienced a sustained period of five years of underemployment \nand two periods of unemployment that resulted in his inability to maintain his financial \nobligations. Initially, Applicant acted responsibly by discharging his debts in 2005 through \nChapter 7 bankruptcy, completing financial counseling, and not incurring any new \ndelinquent debts. Between 2005 and 2012, Applicant was in control of his finances and \ndid not incur any delinquent debt. He purchased his home in 2011 and maintained his \n\n \n6\nmortgage-loan payments and otherwise lived within his means. However, when he was \nlaid off in 2012 and began working as a pizza deliverer, he was unable to maintain control \nof his finances. All of the SOR debts, including his mortgage-loan arrearages, arose \nduring his period of underemployment.  \n \n \nDespite still being underemployed In 2016, Applicant successfully reached an \nagreement with the lender of his mortgage loan and has made timely payments, reducing \nthe arrearage from $18,695 (SOR \u00b6 1.d) to approximately $2,000. He successfully \ndisputed the $200 debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.l. The remaining SOR debts total less than \n$6,200. Applicant has not incurred any delinquent debts since gaining his current \nemployment in July 2017.  \n \n \n\u201cGood faith\u201d means acting in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, \nhonesty, and adherence to duty or obligation. ISCR Case No. 99-0201, 1999 WL 1442346 \nat *4 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 1999). A security clearance adjudication is an evaluation of an \nindividual\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. It is not a debt-collection procedure. \nISCR Case No. 09-02160 (App. Bd. Jun. 21, 2010.) A person is not required to establish \nresolution of every debt alleged in the SOR. He or she need only establish a plan to \nresolve financial problems and take significant actions to implement the plan. The \nadjudicative guidelines do not require that an individual make payments on all delinquent \ndebts simultaneously, nor do they require that the debts alleged in the SOR be paid first. \nSee ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008).  \n \n \n \nAlthough Applicant experienced past financial issues, he established and instituted \na plan to pay his mortgage-loan arrearages, and successfully disputed one of his SOR \ndebts. Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties did not arise under circumstances that suggest \nreckless or irresponsible behavior. He lives within his means and he and his wife maintain \na budget and timely file their tax returns. Although Applicant\u2019s finances are not perfect, \nhe has made a good-faith effort to repay or successfully dispute his debts and has \nestablished a plan to resolve his financial issues within his means. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(b), 20(d), \nand 20(e) apply.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2, the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-person concept, \nan administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by \nconsidering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances. An \nadministrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 \n2. I have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis and \nhave considered the factors in AG \u00b6 2, but have also considered the following: \n \n \nApplicant served honorably on active duty for 15 years and in the Reserve for \nnearly 5 years. His past financial difficulties arose primarily from circumstances outside \nhis control. He was candid and sincere in his testimony.  \n\n \n7\n \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline F, and \nevaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has \nmitigated the security concerns raised by his financial circumstances. Accordingly, I \nconclude he has carried his burden of showing that it is clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant him eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nAs required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, I make the following \nformal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): FOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.h:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.i:  \n \n \n \nStricken \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.j \u2013 1.l: \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nConclusion \n \nI conclude that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s \neligibility for a security clearance.

On May 1, 2018, the Department of Defense (DOD) \nConsolidated Adjudications Facility (CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to him, \nunder Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry (February 20, 1960), as amended and modified; DOD Directive 5220.6, \nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended and modified (Directive); and Directive 4 of the Security Executive Agent \n(SEAD 4), National Security Adjudicative Guidelines (December 10, 2016) (AG), for all \ncovered individuals who require initial or continued eligibility for access to classified \ninformation or eligibility to hold a sensitive position, effective June 8, 2017. \n07/29/2019\n\n \n2 \n                                      \n \n The SOR alleged security concerns under Guideline B (Foreign Influence) and \ndetailed reasons why the DOD adjudicators were unable to find that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for \nApplicant. The SOR recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine \nwhether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.  \n \n \nIn a sworn statement, dated June 9, 2018, Applicant responded to the SOR and \nelected to have his case decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. A complete \ncopy of the Government\u2019s file of relevant material (FORM) was mailed to Applicant by \nthe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) on February 8, 2019, and again on \nApril 19, 2019, and he was afforded an opportunity after receipt of the FORM to file \nobjections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation. In addition to the \nFORM, Applicant was furnished a copy of the Directive as well as the Adjudicative \nGuidelines applicable to his case. Applicant received the FORM on May 7, 2019. \nAlthough a response to the FORM was due on June 6, 2019, as of July 10, 2019, \nApplicant had not responded to the FORM. The case was assigned to me on July 10, \n2019.  \n \nRulings on Procedure \n \nDepartment Counsel requested that the administrative judge assigned the case \ntake Administrative Notice of certain enumerated facts pertaining to the Russian \nFederation (Russia), appearing in extracts of 16 written submissions. Facts are proper \nfor Administrative Notice when they are easily verifiable by an authorized source and \nrelevant and material to the case. In this instance, the Government relied on source \ninformation regarding Russia in publications of the Department of State; the Department \nof Justice; the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency; the Office of the Director of Intelligence, \nNational Counterintelligence and Security Center; the Office of the Director of National \nIntelligence; and the Director of National Intelligence. \n \nAdministrative or official notice is the appropriate type of notice used for \nadministrative proceedings. See ISCR Case No. 05-11292 at 4 n.1 (App. Bd. Apr. 12, \n2007); ISCR Case No. 02-24875 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2006) (citing ISCR Case No. \n02-18668 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 10, 2004)); McLeod v. Immigration and Naturalization \nService, 802 F.2d 89, 93 n.4 (3d Cir. 1986)). The most common basis for administrative \nnotice at ISCR proceedings, is to notice facts that are either well known or from \ngovernment reports. See Stein, ADMINISTRATIVE LAW, Section 25.01 (Bender & Co. \n2006) (listing fifteen types of facts for administrative notice). Requests for administrative \nnotice may utilize authoritative information or sources from the internet. See, e.g. \nHamdan v. Rumsfeld, 126 S.Ct. 2749 (2006) (citing internet sources for numerous \ndocuments).   \n \nAfter weighing the reliability of the source documentation and assessing the \nrelevancy and materiality of the facts proposed by the Government, pursuant to Rule \n201, Federal Rules of Evidence, I take administrative notice of certain facts, as set forth \nbelow under the Russia subsection. However, while I do not reject the facts set forth in \nthe nine press releases issued by the U.S. Department of Justice, any inference that \n\n \n3 \n                                      \n \nApplicant or his family participated in criminal activity was not argued by the \nGovernment and is specifically rejected. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted, with comments, all of the factual \nallegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. through 1.c., of the SOR. Applicant\u2019s admissions and comments \nare incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a complete and thorough review of the \nevidence in the record, and upon due consideration of same, I make the following \nadditional findings of fact:  \n \nApplicant is a 47-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been \nserving as senior service engineer with his current employer since November 2008. \nApplicant\u2019s primary education has not been described, and little information is known \nabout his secondary education. He attended a technical university in Russia for six \nyears, but did not receive a diploma. He has never served with the U.S. military or any \nother military.  He has never held a security clearance. Applicant married in 1992. He \nhas one daughter, born in 1993.  \n \nForeign Influence \n \nApplicant was born in 1972 to Russian parents residing in Russia. Educated in \nRussia, in 2001, he and his Russian-born wife immigrated to the United States through \nthe U.S. Diversity Immigrant Visa Program, known as the Visa Lottery. He became a \nnaturalized U.S. citizen in 2009. It is unclear when his wife was naturalized. When \nApplicant and his wife became naturalized U.S. citizens, they took an oath of allegiance \nto the United States.  That oath is as follows: \n \nI hereby declare, on oath, that I absolutely and entirely renounce and \nabjure all allegiance and fidelity to any foreign prince, potentate, state, or \nsovereignty, of whom or which I have heretofore been a subject or citizen; \nthat I will support and defend the Constitution and laws of the United \nStates of America against all enemies, foreign and domestic; that I will \nbear true faith and allegiance to the same; that I will bear arms on behalf \nof the United States when required by the law; that I will perform \nnoncombatant service in the Armed Forces of the United States when \nrequired by the law; that I will perform work of national importance under \ncivilian direction when required by the law; and that I take this obligation \nfreely, without any mental reservation or purpose of evasion; so help me \nGod. (8 C.F.R. \u00a7 337.1(a) (1995).) \n \nApplicant\u2019s Russian-born daughter is also a naturalized U.S. citizen. They have resided \nin their own family home in the same U.S. city and county since at least October 2004. \n \nApplicant\u2019s mother passed away in 2000. She had previously worked as a ticket \ndistributor on a bus line. His nearly 79-year old father, now retired and in poor health as \na cancer survivor, worked as a driver, mechanic, tire repairer, and glass installer for the \n\n \n4 \n                                      \n \nsame employer as Applicant\u2019s mother. After their divorce, Applicant\u2019s father remarried. \nApplicant\u2019s nearly 73-year old stepmother was also born in Russia, and is in poor health \nas a cancer survivor. She retired from a non-government job not otherwise specified. \nApplicant\u2019s in-laws were Russian-born citizen-residents. His father-in-law, who passed \naway in 2018, was a retired vehicle driver. His mother-in-law, now in her mid-60s, after \nhaving suffered a stroke, is a retired postal worker. After Applicant\u2019s parents divorced, \nhis mother\u2019s brother, his uncle, a Russian-born citizen-resident in his mid-60s, helped \nraise him. He assisted Applicant to come to the United States, and considered coming \nhimself. He was or is a retired security officer at a mall. Applicant\u2019s father, stepmother, \nand uncle, as well as his mother-in-law, reside very far from the areas of turmoil in \nRussia: Chechnya and the Northern Caucasus. No member of Applicant\u2019s family has a \npast or current relationship with the Russian government, military, or intelligence \nservices. \n \nApplicant\u2019s contacts with his father (and step-mother) was previously monthly by \nphone, but it has diminished to one to two times per year. His contact with his mother-\nin-law is generally monthly, when his wife calls her mother. Applicant speaks with his \nuncle on a monthly basis. Applicant has not visited his family in Russia since he arrived \nin the United States in 2001, and he has no plans to return to Russia within the next \ndecade, or more.  \n \nApplicant has furnished emergency financial assistance to various members of \nhis family and extended family in Russia. After his mother-in-law suffered a stroke, he \nsent her $300. Over the past ten years, he has sent her a total of $600, an amount \nwhich he considers insignificant. Over the years, Applicant has sent his uncle various \nsmall amounts, and the total over the past ten years is less than $1,000. He currently \ndoes not send any financial assistance to his family or extended family in Russia. \n \nRussia \n \nRussia is composed of 21 republics. The Government consists of a strong \npresident, a prime minister, a bicameral legislature, and a weak judiciary often subject \nto political manipulation. It is a vast and diverse country with a population of 142 million \npeople. It achieved independence with the dissolution of the Soviet Union on August 24, \n1991, and remains a nuclear superpower that continues to develop politically, socially, \nand economically. On paper, Russia has recognized the legitimacy of international \nhuman rights standards, but it continues to be a \u201cpolice state\u201d where human rights \nabuses are rampant. There are numerous reports of human rights abuses, including law \nenforcement personnel engaged in torture, abuse, and violence to coerce confessions \nfrom suspects, with little accountability, despite the fact that the law prohibits such \npractices; widespread corruption within the police force; arbitrary arrest and detention; \npolitically motivated arrests; abductions; and life threatening prison conditions. The \nmedia is largely state-controlled. There are restrictions on freedom of movement within \nthe country, and all adults must carry government-issued internal passports while \ntraveling internally, and they are required to register with the local authorities within a \nspecified time of their arrival at a new location. \n \n\n \n5 \n                                      \n \nRussia\u2019s two main intelligence services are the Russian Foreign Intelligence \nService (SVR) and the main Intelligence Directorate of the General Staff (GRU), both \noverseen by the Russian National Security Council and coordinated through the \nPermanent Interbranch Commissions of the National Security. Its intelligence capability \nis significant and focuses on collection of information from the United States. The Soviet \nUnion engaged in a series of high profile espionage missions against the United States, \nand Russia has continued the tradition. Russia is one of the two most aggressive \ncollectors of sensitive and protected U.S. technology and accounts for the majority of \nsuch targeting. Russia also provides technologies which could be used in the \nconstruction of weapons of mass destruction and missiles to other countries. It is a \nleading arms exporter, with major sales of advanced weapons and military-related \ntechnology to China, India, Iran, and Venezuela.  Nevertheless, the United States and \nRussia share common interests on a broad range of issues, including counterterrorism \nand the drastic reduction of strategic arsenals. \n \nOn July 26, 2018, the National Counterintelligence and Security Center released \nits 2018 Foreign Economic Espionage in Cyberspace Report, in which it reported that \nforeign economic and industrial espionage against the United States continues to \nrepresent a significant threat to the United States\u2019 prosperity, security, and competitive \nadvantage and identified Russia as one of the three most capable and active cyber \nactors tied to economic espionage and the potential theft of U.S. trade secrets and \nproprietary information. It reported that Russia uses cyber operations as an instrument \nof intelligence collection to inform its decision-making and benefit its economic interests, \nand that Russian intelligence services have conducted sophisticated and large-scale \nhacking operations to collect sensitive U.S. business and technology information. \n \nThe report noted that, \u201c[a]n aggressive and capable collector of sensitive U.S. \ntechnologies, Russia uses cyberspace as one of many methods for obtaining the \nnecessary know-how and technology to grown and modernize its economy.\u201d Other \nmethods of collection include use of Russian commercial and academic enterprises that \ninteract with the West; recruitment of Russian immigrants with advanced technical skills \nby the Russian intelligence services; and Russian intelligence penetration of public and \nprivate enterprises, which enable the Russian government to obtain sensitive technical \ninformation from industry. \n \nOn February 13, 2018, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) \nissued its Worldwide Threat Assessment of the U.S. Intelligence Community, Statement \nfor the Record, in which it assessed that Russia will employ a variety of aggressive \ntactics to bolster its standing as a great power, weaken the United States, and \nundermine Euro-Atlantic unity; and that Russia will use a range of relatively low-cost \ntools to advance its foreign policy objectives, including influence campaigns, economic \ncoercion, cyber operations, and measured military force. The ODNI also assessed that \nPresident Putin will likely increase his use of repression and intimidation to contend with \ndomestic discontent over corruption, poor social services, and a sluggish economy; he \nwill continue to manipulate the media and is likely to expand the Russian government\u2019s \nlegal basis for repression; and during 2018, Russia will continue to modernize, develop, \nand field a wide range of advanced nuclear, conventional, and asymmetric capabilities \n\n \n6 \n                                      \n \nto balance its perception of a strategic military inferiority vis-a-vis the United States.  \nRussia will also seek to maintain, and where possible, expand its influence through the \nformer Soviet countries that it asserts are in its self-described sphere of influence. \n \nThe ODNI has reported that areas of highest interest to foreign intelligence \ncollectors include energy/alternative energy; biotechnology; defense technology; \nenvironmental protection; high-end manufacturing; and information and communications \ntechnology. In March 2017, the U.S. Department of Justice indicted two Russian \nFederal Security Service officials and their Russian cybercriminal conspirators on \ncomputer hacking and conspiracy charges related to the collection of emails of U.S. and \nEuropean employees of transportation and financial services firms. The charges \nincluded conspiring to engage in economic espionage and theft of trade secrets. \n \nThe ODNI has also reported that Russian efforts to influence the 2016 U.S. \npresidential election represent the most recent expression of Russia\u2019s long-standing \ndesire to undermine the U.S.-led liberal democratic order and noted that \u201cthese activities \ndemonstrated a significant escalation in directness, level of activity, and scope of effort \ncompared to previous operations.\u201d The 2016 influence campaign reflected Russia\u2019s \nrecognition of the worldwide effects that mass disclosure of U.S. Government and other \nprivate data have achieved in recent years. The ODNI assessed that Russian \nintelligence services will continue to develop capabilities to provide President Putin with \noptions to use against the United States. \n \nThe U.S. Department of State Travel Advisory for Russia is Level 2 - Exercise \nIncreased Caution, due to terrorism, harassment, and the arbitrary enforcement of local \nlaws. The advisory directs U.S. citizens not to travel to the North Caucasus, including \nChechnya and Mount Elbrus, due to terrorism and civil unrest; or to Crimea due to \nRussia\u2019s occupation of the Ukrainian territory and abuses by its occupying authorities. \nTerrorist groups continue plotting possible attacks in Russia, and may attack with little \nor no warning. U.S. citizens have been arbitrarily interrogated or detained by Russian \nofficials and may become victims of harassment, mistreatment, and extortion. Due to \nthe Russian government-imposed reduction on U.S. diplomatic personnel in Russia, the \nU.S. Government has reduced ability to provide services to U.S. citizens. \n \nThe Department of State has assessed Moscow as being a high-threat location \nfor terrorist activity directed at or affecting official U.S. Government interests. Although \nRussia continued to prioritize counterterrorism efforts in 2017, it remained a target of \ninternational terrorist groups, particularly ISIS. \n \nRussia has attempted to reassert its dominance in, and integration of, the former \nSoviet states and has generally been successful with Belarus and Armenia. It has \nremained unwelcomingly active in the internal affairs of several of its neighboring \ncountries\u2014former republics of the Soviet Union or occupied \u201cindependent countries\u201d\u2014\nsuch as Georgia, Ukraine, Azerbaijan, and Moldova, and has issued threats against \nPoland (a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) since 1999), the \nCzech Republic (a member of NATO since 1999), and Estonia (a member of NATO \nsince 2004). Russia maintains an extensive military presence in Crimea and is likely to \n\n \n7 \n                                      \n \ntake further military actions in Crimea as part of its occupation of this part of Ukraine. \nThe international community, including the United States and Ukraine, does not \nrecognize Russia\u2019s purported annexation of Crimea. In response to Russia\u2019s violations \nof Ukraine\u2019s sovereignty, and other acts, the United States suspended most bilateral \nengagement with the Russian government on economic issues. Anti-American and anti-\nWestern rhetoric is widespread in both official media sources and on social media. \n \nIn its 2017 Human Rights Report, the Department of State reported that Russia\u2019s \noccupation and purported annexation of Ukraine\u2019s Crimean Peninsula continued to \naffect the human rights situation in Russia significantly and negatively. Credible \nobservers attributed thousands of civilian deaths and injuries, as well as widespread \nabuses, to Russian-led forces in Ukraine\u2019s Donbas region and to Russian occupation \nauthorities in Crimea. Human rights groups asserted that numerous Ukrainian citizens \nremained in Russia as political prisoners. \n \nThe most significant human rights issues in Russia included extrajudicial killings; \nenforced disappearance; torture that was systematic and sometimes resulted in death \nand sometimes included punitive psychiatric incarceration; harsh and life-threatening \nconditions in prisons; arbitrary arrest and detention; lack of judicial independence; \npolitical prisoners; severe interference with privacy; severe restrictions on freedom of \nexpression and the media; increasingly severe restriction on freedom of association, \nincluding laws on \u201cforeign agents\u201d and \u201cundesirable foreign organizations;\u201d and \nwidespread corruption at all levels and in all branches of government. The government \nfailed to take adequate steps to prosecute or punish most officials who committed \nabuses, resulting in a climate of impunity. \n \nCybercrime is also a significant problem across Russia. The risk of infection, \ncompromise, and theft via malware, spam email, sophisticated spear phishing, and \nsocial engineering attacks is significant. Telephone and electronic communications are \nsubject to surveillance at any time without advisory. The Russian System for \nOperational-Investigative Activities permits authorities to monitor and record all data that \ntraverses Russia\u2019s networks. \n \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the \nExecutive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security \nemphasizing, \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d (Department of the Navy v. \nEgan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988)) As Commander in Chief, the President has the \nauthority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine \nwhether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant an applicant \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d (Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.)     \n \n\n \n8 \n                                      \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the guidelines in SEAD 4. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the guidelines list potentially disqualifying \nconditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s \neligibility for access to classified information. \n \nAn administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules \nof law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines \nare applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of \nvariables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a meaningful decision. \n \nIn the decision-making process, facts must be established by \u201csubstantial \nevidence.\u201d \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind \nmight accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all contrary evidence in the \nrecord.\u201d  (ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 \nE3.1.32.1))  \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a \npreponderance.\u201d  (See v. Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th \nCir. 1994).) \n \nThe Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish a \npotentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced \nsubstantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the \napplicant has the burden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, \nextenuation or mitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government\u2019s \ncase. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. \n(See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).) \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as \nwell. It is because of this special relationship that the Government must be able to \nrepose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants \naccess to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nFurthermore, \u201csecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of \ndenials.\u201d (Id.) \n \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no \nsense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d (See Exec. Or. \n10865 \u00a7 7) Thus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have \n\n \n9 \n                                      \n \nbased this decision, in whole or in part, on any express or implied determination as to \nApplicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has \nor has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance.  In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those \nconclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence contained in the \nrecord. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or \nconjecture. \n \nAnalysis \n \n \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Foreign Influence is set out in \nAG \u00b6 6:  \n      \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they \nresult in divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern \nif they create circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to \npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign \ncontacts and interests should consider the country in which the foreign \ncontact or interest is located, including, but not limited to, considerations \nsuch as whether it is known to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or \nsensitive information or is associated with a risk of terrorism. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 7: \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the \nindividual's desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing \nthat information or technology. \nWhen an allegation under a disqualifying condition is established, \u201cthe Directive \npresumes there is a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct or \ncircumstances . . . and an applicant\u2019s security eligibility. Direct or objective evidence of \nnexus is not required.\u201d  (ISCR Case No. 17-00507 at 2 (App. Bd. June 13, 2018) (citing \nISCR Case No. 15-08385 at 4 (App. Bd. May 23, 2018)) \n \n\n \n10 \n                                      \n \nThe mere possession of close family ties with a person in a foreign country is not, \nas a matter of law, disqualifying under Guideline B.  However, if only one relative lives in \na foreign country, and an applicant has contacts with that relative, this factor alone is \nsufficient to create the potential for foreign influence and could potentially result in the \ncompromise of classified information. (See ISCR Case No. 03-02382 at 5 (App. Bd. \nFeb. 15, 2006); ISCR Case No. 99-0424 at 12 (App. Bd. Feb. 8, 2001)) Applicant\u2019s \nrelationship with his father, stepmother, mother-in-law, and uncle in Russia, are current \nconcerns for the Government. However, the security significance of these identified \nconcerns requires further examination of Applicant\u2019s respective relationships with those \nfamily members who are Russian citizen-residents to determine the degree of \n\u201cheightened risk\u201d or potential conflict of interest.  \n \nIn assessing whether there is a heightened risk because of an applicant\u2019s \nrelatives in a foreign country, it is necessary to consider all relevant factors, including \nthe totality of an applicant\u2019s conduct and circumstances, including the realistic potential \nfor exploitation. One such factor is the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress. In that regard, it is important to consider the character of the foreign power in \nquestion, including the government and entities controlled by the government, within the \nrelevant foreign country. Nothing in Guideline B suggests it is limited to countries that \nare hostile to the United States.  (See ISCR Case No. 00-0317 at 6 (App. Bd. Mar. 29, \n2002); ISCR Case No. 00-0489 at 12 (App. Bd. Jan. 10, 2002)) In fact, the Appeal \nBoard has cautioned against \u201creliance on overly simplistic distinctions between \u2018friendly\u2019 \nnations and \u2018hostile\u2019 nations when adjudicating cases under Guideline B.\u201d (ISCR Case \nNo. 00-0317 at 6 (App. Bd. Mar. 29, 2002)) \n \nThere is a rebuttable presumption that a person has ties of affection for, or \nobligation to, his or her family members, and this presumption includes in-laws. (ISCR \nCase No. 07-06030 at 3 (App. Bd. June 19, 2008); ISCR Case No. 05-00939 at 4 (App. \nBd. Oct. 3, 2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 01-03120 at 4 (App. Bd. Feb. 20, 2002)) \nApplicant has not denied that he has affection for his family members.   \n \nThe DOHA Appeal Board has indicated for Guideline B cases, \u201cthe nature of the \nforeign government involved and the intelligence-gathering history of that government \nare among the important considerations that provide context for the other record \nevidence and must be brought to bear on the Judge\u2019s ultimate conclusions in the case. \nThe country\u2019s human rights record is another important consideration.\u201d (ISCR Case No. \n16-02435 at 3 (May 15, 2018) (citing ISCR Case No. 15-00528 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 13, \n2017)) Another important consideration is the nature of a nation\u2019s government\u2019s \nrelationship with the United States. These factors are relevant in assessing the \nlikelihood that an applicant\u2019s family members living in that country are vulnerable to \ngovernment coercion or inducement.  \n \nThe risk of coercion, persuasion, or duress is significantly greater if the foreign \ncountry has an authoritarian government, the government ignores the rule of law \nincluding widely accepted civil liberties, a family member is associated with or \ndependent upon the government, the government is engaged in a counterinsurgency, \nterrorists cause a substantial amount of death or property damage, or the country is \n\n \n11 \n                                      \n \nknown to conduct intelligence collection operations against the United States. The \nrelationship of Russia with the United States, and the situation in Russia place a burden \nof persuasion on Applicant to demonstrate that his relationships with any family member \nliving in Russia does not pose a security risk. Applicant should not be placed into a \nposition where he might be forced to choose between loyalty to the United States and a \ndesire to assist a relative living in Russia.  \n \nWhile there is no evidence that intelligence operatives, criminals, or terrorists \nfrom or in Russia seek or have sought classified or economic information from or \nthrough Applicant or his family, nevertheless, it is not prudent to rule out such a \npossibility in the future. International terrorist groups are known to conduct intelligence \nactivities as effectively as capable state intelligence services, and Russia has a \nsignificant problem with terrorism and crime. Applicant\u2019s family in Russia \u201ccould be a \nmeans through which Applicant comes to the attention of those who seek U.S. \ninformation or technology and who would attempt to exert coercion upon him.\u201d (ADP \nCase No. 14-01655 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 9, 2015) (citing ISCR Case No. 14-02950 at 3 \n(App. Bd. May 14, 2015)) \n  \nApplicant\u2019s relationships with relatives who are living in Russia create a potential \nconflict of interest because Russian intelligence operatives could place pressure on or \noffer inducements to his family in Russia in an effort to cause Applicant to compromise \nclassified information. These relationships create a potential heightened risk of foreign \ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion. AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a) and 7(b) have been \nestablished.  \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from foreign influence under AG \u00b6 8: \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nUnited States;  \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual's sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country is \nso minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships \nand loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any \nconflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest; and \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation. \n\n \n12 \n                                      \n \nApplicant has substantial connections to the United States, having lived in the \nUnited States for nearly two decades. His wife and his child are naturalized U.S. citizens \nresiding in the United States. He owns a residence in the United States.  \n \nDepartment Counsel argued that the presence of terrorist groups; the increased \nlevels of terrorism, violence, and insurgency; and human rights problems in Russia \ndemonstrate that a heightened risk of exploitation, coercion or duress are present due \nto Applicant\u2019s close ties to his family. Based on their various relationships, and the \ngeographical locations of Applicant\u2019s family, there is a potential, but greatly reduced, \nrisk \u2013 a \u201cheightened risk\u201d \u2013 of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, \nor coercion to disqualify Applicant from holding a security clearance.  \n \nHowever, that risk is not generated solely by the Russian government, but also \nby terrorists striking out against the central Russian authorities and all foreigners. \nApplicant\u2019s family members are potential targets in this war on civilized humanity. The \npresence of terrorist groups and increased levels of terrorism, violence, and insurgency \nin Russia have also been described for events occurring on September 11, 2001, and \nmore recently in Fort Hood, Boston, Paris, Nice, Orlando, San Bernardino, and New \nYork City.  \n \n There is no evidence that Applicant\u2019s family members are or have ever been \npolitical activists, challenging the policies of the Russian government; that terrorists \nhave approached or threatened them for any reason; that the Russian government or \nany terrorist organization have approached them; or that they currently engage in \nactivities that would bring attention to themselves. As such, there is a reduced \npossibility that they would be targets for coercion or exploitation by the Russian \ngovernment or the terrorists, which may seek to quiet those who speak out against \nthem. They reside far from the areas of turmoil in Russia: Chechnya and the Northern \nCaucasus. Under these circumstances, the potential heightened risk created by their \nresidence in Russia is greatly diminished. Under the developed evidence, it is unlikely \nApplicant will be placed in a position of having to choose between the interests of a \nforeign individual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the United \nStates. I am persuaded that Applicant\u2019s loyalty to the United States is steadfast and \nundivided, and that he has \u201csuch deep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in \nthe U.S., that he can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. \ninterest.\u201d AG \u00b6\u00b6 8(a) and 8(b) apply.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(d): \n  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \n\n \n13 \n                                      \n \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Moreover, I have \nevaluated the various aspects of this case in light of the totality of the record evidence \nand have not merely performed a piecemeal analysis. (See U.S. v. Bottone, 365 F.2d \n389, 392 (2d Cir. 1966); See also ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Jun. 2, \n2006).)  \n \nThere is some evidence against mitigating Applicant\u2019s situation. A Guideline B \ndecision concerning Russia must take into consideration the geopolitical situation and \ndangers there. (See ISCR Case No. 04-02630 at 3 (App. Bd. May 23, 2007) (remanding \nbecause of insufficient discussion of geopolitical situation and suggesting expansion of \nwhole-person discussion).) Russia has a history of espionage against the United States \nand violence from terrorists, and the Russian government does not respect the full \nspectrum of human rights. Yes, Russia is a bad actor on the international stage. \nApplicant\u2019s 79-year-old father, 73-year-old step-mother, his uncle and mother-in-law, \nboth of whom are in their mid-60s, reside in Russia. While they are more vulnerable to \ndirect coercion or exploitation, because of their age and low political profile, as well as \ntheir geographic location within Russia, the realistic possibility of pressure, coercion, \nexploitation, or duress with regard to them is relatively low. \n \nThe mitigating evidence under the whole-person concept is simply more \nsubstantial. Applicant is a 47-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been \nserving as senior service engineer with his current employer since November 2008. He, \nhis wife, and their daughter have resided in the United States since they immigrated \nhere in 2001, and they are all naturalized U.S. citizens.  With his wife and child residing \nin the United States, there is a reduced \u201cheightened risk\u201d of foreign exploitation, \ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion. While he still retains an affection for \nthose of his family who have remained citizens and residents of Russia, his contacts \nwith them have diminished substantially from where they were initially. Because of \ncertain health issues, he sent modest sums of money to assist them during difficult \ntimes. Applicant has not seen any of his overseas family since he and his immediate \nfamily immigrated to the United States in 2001, and he has no plans to return to Russia \nwithin the next decade, or more. \n  \nMoreover, while terrorist activities occur in Russia, they are also active in the \nUnited States, creating a \u201cheightened risk\u201d here as well. Under the evidence presented, \nI have no questions about Applicant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified information. See AG \u00b6 2(a)(1) through AG \u00b6 2(a)(9). \n \n\n \n14 \n                                      \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant mitigated the security concerns arising from the Government\u2019s \nforeign influence concerns.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a. through 1.c.:  \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application on April 13, 2016. On June \n10, 2019, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility (DOD CAF) \nsent him a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging security concerns under Guideline I. \nThe DOD CAF acted under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, \nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated in Security \nExecutive Agent Directive 4, National Security Adjudicative Guidelines (December 10, \n2016). \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on July 6, 2019, denied all the allegations, and \nrequested a hearing before an administrative judge. Department Counsel was ready to \nproceed on August 16, 2019, and the case was assigned to me on August 21, 2019. On \n\n \n2 \n \nSeptember 5, 2019, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) notified \nApplicant that the hearing was scheduled for September 24, 2019. I convened the hearing \nas scheduled. Government Exhibits (GX) 1 and 2 were admitted in evidence without \nobjection. Applicant testified and submitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AX) A through D, which \nwere admitted without objection. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on October 2, 2019. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is a 31-year-old systems administrator employed by defense contractors \nsince February 2016. He served on active duty in the U.S. Army from August 2006 to \nFebruary 2015. His Army service included one tour of duty in Iraq and two in Afghanistan. \nHe was deployed as an information technology (IT) specialist and was not involved in \ndirect combat. (Tr. 19-20.) He was awarded the Army Commendation Medal three times, \nthe Joint Service Achievement Medal, the Army Achievement Medal twice, and various \nservice medals. (AX C.) He was discharged as a sergeant and received an honorable \ndischarge. He has held a security clearance since February 2006. \n \nApplicant married in November 2009, divorced in October 2011, remarried in \nMarch 2013, and divorced in April 2014. He has no children. He attended college classes \nfrom August 2007 to January 2012 and attended a technical institute from June 2015 to \nFebruary 2016, but he did not receive a degree.  \n \n \nApplicant began having difficulty sleeping after he returned from deployment in \n2011 or 2012. He attributed his sleep difficulty to jet lag and frequently switching shifts \nwhile deployed. He consulted with an Army psychiatrist, who prescribed a sleep \nmedication.  \n \nIn 2013, after Applicant was reassigned to another duty station, he received a \nprescription from a military clinic for a sleep medication. He used it for about two months \nand then stopped using it after he overslept, missed an appointment with his battalion \ncommander, and received nonjudicial punishment for missing the appointment.  \n \n \nAfter Applicant was discharged from the Army, the Department of Veterans Affairs \n(VA) determined that he was not suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). \n(Tr. 20.) He testified that his only mental-health issues while on active duty were related \nto falling asleep, staying asleep, and getting to work on time. (Tr. 21.) \n \nApplicant was employed by a local school district as a maintenance technician \nfrom January to September 2015. He left the job by mutual agreement after repeatedly \noversleeping and coming to work late. He sought help from a VA mental-health clinic for \nhis sleep issues. He testified that he was in a cycle in which his anxiety about falling \nasleep and waking up on time kept him awake. His inability to break the cycle caused him \nto be depressed. He consulted with a VA psychiatrist, who prescribed a medication that \nmade him feel tired and lethargic during the day. He told the psychiatrist about the \nadverse effects of the medication and the psychiatrist asked him what he wanted to do \nabout it. Applicant promptly requested an appointment with a psychologist instead of a \n\n \n3 \n \npsychiatrist. For four or five months, he received counseling from a VA psychologist. He \ndescribed the counseling as follows:  \n \nSleep hygiene such as making sure you dim the lights, don\u2019t use electronics, \nmaybe read, listen to music, things to take your mind off of being active until \nthe last minutes before you fall sleep. Meditation, mindfulness. We spoke \nabout issues in my past. Spoke about my military career. So, it was just \nputting everything out on the table instead of holding it all in. \n \nApplicant testified that the counseling gave him \u201ca whole regime of treating your \nbody and mind in order to facilitate a better night\u2019s sleep.\u201d (Tr. 27, 43.) He found the \ncounseling program helpful, and his anxiety and insomnia improved, even though he was \nnot taking any medication. (Tr. 27, 43.)  \n \n \nIn January 2017, Applicant again sought treatment from a VA mental-health clinic \nregarding anxiety and insomnia. He received more counseling about coping strategies, \nmindfulness exercises, and sleep strategies. He received a prescription for a sleep \nmedication (Xanax), to be used on an \u201cas needed\u201d basis, and an over-the-counter \nmedication (Melatonin). The Melatonin enhanced his ability to sleep, to the extent that he \nbegan using Xanax one night per week or less. After consulting with his mental-health \nprovider, a psychiatric nurse practitioner, he stopped using the Xanax. (AX A.)  \n \n \nIn July 2017, two men attempted to break into Applicant\u2019s home. Applicant was \nwatching television in the evening when he heard footsteps in his enclosed back yard. \nHis back yard was covered with rocks and gravel, which made movement noisy. (Tr. 31.) \nHe retrieved his handgun from a night stand in the bedroom, peered through the curtains \non the sliding glass door to the back yard, and observed two men wearing \u201choodies\u201d with \nbandanas covering their faces. He opened the door and fired three shots at the men, who \nran away and climbed over a five-foot cinder-block wall. He shot one of the men in the \nfoot. After the men fled, he called the police, who responded in 5-10 minutes. (Tr. 31-32.) \n \nThe injured man was later found in a hospital by the police and charged with \nburglary. Applicant was not charged with any offense. In June 2019, he was notified by \nthe county attorney\u2019s office that the burglar was being tried in July and that he, listed as \na victim, was invited to attend the trial. (AX D.) \n \n \nAbout a week after the attempted burglary, Applicant was home alone around \nmidnight when he was awakened by a loud noise caused when a large board that he had \nused to secure the slider after the burglary attempt fell to the floor. Fearing another \nburglary or retribution for shooting the previous burglar, Applicant donned a body-armor \nvest, picked up his shotgun, turned on all the lights, checked the house, found no one \npresent, and returned to his bedroom. About five minutes later, Applicant\u2019s roommate \ncame home and saw Applicant sitting on his bed, wearing body armor and holding a \nshotgun. (Tr. 33-34.) A psychologist conducting a psychiatric evaluation requested by the \nDOD CAF in March 2019 evaluation stated, \u201cHe reported [to her] that he went into his \ncloset and called the police.\u201d (GX 2 at 5.) Applicant did not mention calling the police in \n\n \n4 \n \nhis interview with a security investigator in September 2017 or his testimony at the \nhearing. \n \n \nAfter the attempted burglary, Applicant again sought help from the local VA \nhospital for anxiety and sleep deprivation. He was given a holistic treatment plan that \nincluded exercises to be conducted before going to bed, proper sleep hygiene, improved \ndiet and exercise, and a sleep-aid medication.  \n \nIn August 2017, Applicant was being considered for an assignment in Iraq, and he \nconsulted with his VA care provider, a psychiatric nurse practitioner, seeking a medical \nwaiver that would allow him to accept the assignment. The VA provider determined that \nhe had no limitations or psychological impairments. She noted that his mood was stable, \nhe was no longer depressed, and his insomnia was being controlled with medications. \nHer evaluation was approved by a clinical nurse specialist and a medical doctor assigned \nto the military command that Applicant would be supporting in Iraq. (AX A.) Applicant was \ndeployed to Iraq from October 2017 to December 2018. (AX B; SOR Answer at 2.) He \nhad no issues with sleep or depression, and he testified that he was promoted twice while \nin Iraq. (Tr. 39.) \n \n \nIn March 2019, the DOD CAF referred Applicant\u2019s case for a psychological \nevaluation. The psychologist who evaluated Applicant noted that he had two brief and \nrather volatile marriages, that he has limited involvement with four older half-siblings, that \nhe was sexually abused by his maternal grandfather and sexually assaulted by a former \nmale friend, that he has \u201cdistant peer relationships,\u201d and that he has found it difficult to \nreestablish connections with former friends. She noted that he was unemployed when his \nlast contract ended in December 2018 and that he was hoping for a new contract in April \n2019. (He is still sponsored by the same employer but apparently was between contracts \nwhen he was interviewed by the psychologist.)  She did not mention or discuss the fact \nthat Applicant had recently completed a 15-month deployment to a hostile-fire area \nwithout incident. \n \nThe psychologist diagnosed Applicant with chronic PTSD and a recurrent major \ndepressive disorder. None of the military and VA medical professionals who had \npreviously treated Applicant from 2012 to 2017 had diagnosed him with PTSD. She \ncommented: \n \nThe risk of future depressive episodes and difficulties with insomnia and \nPTSD symptoms seem likely in the context of [Applicant\u2019s] continued social \nisolation and unemployment. By wielding a weapon in his home, [Applicant] \nhas evidenced erratic behavior which could have reasonably led to \nunintentionally harming or killing himself or bystanders; there, his judgment \nappears to be questionable. Further, he reported no currently (sic) \ninvolvement in outpatient therapy or psychiatric medication management. \nAs such, it appears that [Applicant] is not currently involved in sufficient \ncounseling or other medical treatment to address his existing psychological \nconditions or mitigate the aforementioned behavior of concern. \n\n \n5 \n \nThe psychologist concluded that Applicant\u2019s \u201ccurrent, untreated psychiatric \nsymptoms may impact his judgment, reliability, or trustworthiness concerning classified \ninformation. Additionally, the risk to judgment and reliability of any future mental health \nproblems is likely. His prognosis is guarded at this time.\u201d (GX 2,) The psychologist\u2019s \nevaluation triggered the SOR. \n \n \nAt the hearing, Applicant testified that he was not experiencing depression. His \nanxiety was limited to concern about his security clearance. He was not taking any \nmedications or receiving counseling. He testified that if his symptoms reappeared he \nwould know how to respond to them proactively. (Tr. 42.)  \n \n \nApplicant has never been directed to undergo counseling or treatment. In every \ncase, he self-referred when he experienced anxiety, insomnia, or depression. (Tr. 43.) \n \nPolicies \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2.  \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016).   \n \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \n \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline I, Psychological Conditions \n \n \nThe record in this case includes the conflicting diagnoses of two sets of medical \nprofessionals, both from medical professionals employed by the U.S. Government. The \nfirst diagnosis is from the VA mental-health clinic that treated Applicant for January to \nAugust 2017 and the military doctor who cleared him for deployment to Iraq. The second \nis from the psychologist employed to conduct the March 2019 evaluation requested by \nthe DOD CAF. The SOR is based on the March 2019 evaluation. \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.a alleges that Applicant reported to the psychologist in March 2019 that \nhe had been prescribed various drugs for insomnia and depressive symptoms and that \non each occasion he had stopped using the drugs \u201cfor reasons other than a doctor\u2019s \nadvice.\u201d \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.b alleges that in July 2017, Appellant, while in his home, feared that he \nwas in danger from an earlier event, so he donned a bulletproof vest and grabbed his \nshotgun, but there was no one in his home and he was not in danger. It further alleges \nthat the psychologist who evaluated Applicant in March 2017 \u201cdeemed this action to be \nerratic, described it as an exhibition of poor judgment, and attributed it to post-traumatic \nstress disorder.\u201d \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.c alleges that the psychologist who conducted the evaluation in March \n2019 diagnosed him with chronic PTSD and recurrent major depressive disorder; found \n\n \n7 \n \nthat his current, untreated psychiatric symptoms may impact his judgment, reliability or \ntrustworthiness concerning classified information; and found that \u201cthe risk to judgment \nand reliability of any future mental health problems is likely.\u201d Her prognosis was \n\u201cguarded.\u201d \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.a is not established. With the exception of the anti-anxiety medication \nprescribed by a VA psychiatrist in 2015, all the medications, which were sleep aids, were \nprescribed to be used as needed. When Applicant experienced adverse effects from the \nanti-anxiety medication in 2015, he informed the psychiatrist of his concerns and sought \nalternative treatment from a VA psychologist.  \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.b is based on the March 2019 evaluation of the second event in July \n2017, when Applicant thought that he was about to be burglarized a second time. The \npsychologist apparently had no concerns about Applicant\u2019s use of deadly force in \nresponse to the attempted burglary, but she described Applicant\u2019s response to the second \nincident as \u201cerratic and an exhibition of poor judgment because it could have resulted in \nharm to himself or others.\u201d I find that this conclusion is unsupported by the evidence. \nApplicant was awakened by a loud noise consistent with someone breaking in through \nthe sliding door. He responded by turning on the lights, donning a body-armor vest, \ngrabbing his shotgun, checking the house, and returning to his bedroom after determining \nthat there was nobody in the house. As a seven-year Army veteran, he was well-trained \nin the safe use of a weapon. His conduct was not \u201cerratic,\u201d nor was it unnecessarily \ndangerous. \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.b also adopts the psychologist\u2019s conclusion that Applicant\u2019s conduct was \nattributed to PTSD. She does not articulate the factual basis for this conclusion. He was \nfound to not have PTSD when he was discharged from the Army. He was seen by military \nand VA medical professionals in 2012, 2013, and 2017, and none of them raised the \npossibility of PTSD. The diagnosis of PTSD was based on a single meeting with the \npsychologist who conducted the March 2019 evaluation, and it is inconsistent with the \nevaluations of the VA medical personnel who treated Applicant for eight months before \nhis recent deployment to Iraq. \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.c is established by the March 2019 evaluation and the evidence of \nApplicant\u2019s treatment for depression at the VA mental-health clinic.  \n \n \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 27: \n \nCertain emotional, mental, and personality conditions can impair judgment, \nreliability, or trustworthiness. A formal diagnosis of a disorder is not required \nfor there to be a concern under this guideline. A duly qualified mental health \nprofessional (e.g., clinical psychologist or psychiatrist) employed by, or \nacceptable to and approved by the U.S. Government, should be consulted \nwhen evaluating potentially disqualifying and mitigating information under \nthis guideline and an opinion, including prognosis, should be sought. No \n\n \n8 \n \nnegative inference concerning the standards in this guideline may be raised \nsolely on the basis of mental health counseling. \n \n \nThe following disqualifying conditions under this guideline may be applicable:  \n \nAG \u00b6 28(a): behavior that casts doubt on an individual's judgment, stability, \nreliability, or trustworthiness, not covered under any other guideline and that \nmay indicate an emotional, mental, or personality condition, including, but \nnot limited to, irresponsible, violent, self-harm, suicidal, paranoid, \nmanipulative, impulsive, chronic lying, deceitful, exploitative, or bizarre \nbehaviors; \n \nAG \u00b6 28(b): an opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional that \nthe individual has a condition that may impair judgment, stability, reliability, \nor trustworthiness; and \n \nAG \u00b6 28(d): failure to follow a prescribed treatment plan related to a \ndiagnosed psychological/psychiatric condition that may impair judgment, \nstability, reliability, or trustworthiness, including, but not limited to, failure to \ntake prescribed medication or failure to attend required counseling \nsessions. \n \nAG \u00b6 28(a) is not established, because there is no evidence of behavior that casts \ndoubt on Applicant\u2019s current judgment, stability, reliability, or trustworthiness. AG \u00b6 28(b) \nis raised by the March 2019 evaluation. AG \u00b6 28(d) is not established because there is \nno evidence that medical approval was required to terminate the use of sleep aids, and \nApplicant took prompt steps to seek alternative medical treatment when the anti-anxiety \nmedication prescribed in 2015 produced adverse effects.  \n \nThe following conditions are potentially applicable: \n \nAG \u00b6 29(a): the identified condition is readily controllable with treatment, \nand the individual has demonstrated ongoing and consistent compliance \nwith the treatment plan;  \n \nAG \u00b6 29(c): recent opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional \nemployed by, or acceptable to and approved by, the U.S. Government that \nan individual's previous condition is under control or in remission, and has \na low probability of recurrence or exacerbation;  \n \nAG \u00b6 29(d): the past psychological/psychiatric condition was temporary, the \nsituation has been resolved, and the individual no longer shows indications \nof emotional instability; and \n \nAG \u00b6 29(e): there is no indication of a current problem. \n \n\n \n9 \n \n \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 29(a) and 29(c) are established by the evidence from the VA mental-health \nclinic staff and the approval of Applicant\u2019s medical waiver for deployment to Iraq. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 29(d) is not fully established. Applicant\u2019s insomnia and the resulting anxiety \nand depression are not temporary conditions, but they are in remission. Applicant \nsuccessfully completed a 15-month deployment to a hostile-fire area and has exhibited \nno indications of emotional instability since his return.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 29(e) is established. Applicant successfully completed a 15-month \ndeployment to Iraq without incident. The March 2019 evaluation concludes that there is a \ncurrent problem, but it is contradicted by the VA evaluation, the approval of Applicant\u2019s \nmedical waiver, and his successful completion of a stressful and demanding deployment. \nFor the reasons set out above, I found the VA evaluation more persuasive than the March \n2019 evaluation. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline I in my whole-person analysis \nand applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). Applicant\u2019s testimony at the hearing \nwas calm, candid, sincere, and persuasive. He served honorably for seven years in the \nU.S. Army, including three deployments to combat zones. He has held a security \nclearance since 2006. He has acted responsibly to overcome his problems with anxiety, \ninsomnia, and depression. In every instance, he self-referred himself for treatment, and \nhe has reached the point where he is using the strategies he has been taught to cope \nwith his problems without medication.  \n \n \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline I, and \nevaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has \n\n \n10 \n \nmitigated the security concerns raised by his history of anxiety, insomnia, and depression. \nHe has refuted the allegation that he has PTSD.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \n \n \nGuideline I, Psychological Conditions: \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.c: \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nI conclude that it is clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nClearance is granted. \n \n \n \n \nLeRoy F.

Based upon a review of the case file, including pleadings and exhibits, \nnational security eligibility for access to classified information is denied.  \nStatement of Case \nOn May 9, 2018, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued Applicant a Statement \nof Reasons (SOR), detailing security concerns under Guideline F (Financial \nConsiderations) and Guideline E (Personal Conduct). The action was taken under \nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, \n1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the National \nSecurity Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified \nInformation or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AG), effective on June 8, 2017.  \n  \nApplicant submitted an undated Answer to the SOR, and requested that his case \nbe decided by an administrative judge on the written record without a hearing. On March \n\n \n \n2 \n \n \n26, 2018, Department Counsel submitted the Government\u2019s written case. A complete \ncopy of the File of Relevant Material (FORM), containing nine Items, was mailed to \nApplicant and received by him on April 14, 2019. The FORM notified Applicant that he \nhad an opportunity to file objections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, or \nmitigation within 30 days of receipt of the FORM. Applicant did not submit a response to \nthe FORM or object to the Government\u2019s evidence. Items 1 through 9 are admitted into \nevidence. The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) assigned this case to me \non June 20, 2019.  \n \nFindings of Fact  \n \n \nApplicant admitted five of the ten debts alleged debts in Paragraph 1 of the SOR: \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 1.c, 1.e, and 1.h. He denied the other five alleged debts: \u00b6\u00b6 1.d, 1.f, 1.g, 1.i, \nand 1.j. He denied the three falsification charges alleged in Paragraph 2 of the SOR: \u00b6\u00b6 \n2.a, 2.b, and 2.c. \n \nApplicant is 30 years old and single. He served on active duty in the Marine Corps \nfrom 2008 to 2012. He received a general discharge under honorable conditions. After \nbeing discharged from military service, he worked from 2013 to 2016 for non-government \nemployers. In his January 2017 security clearance application (SCA), he indicated that \nhe had been unemployed since October 2016. (Item 4)  \n \nFinancial Considerations \n \n \nDuring a June 2017 interview with a government investigator, Applicant discussed \nseveral charged-off accounts, subsequently alleged in the SOR. He said he did not have \nknowledge of several listed debts. He intended to pay two credit card debts. He said he \nstopped paying debts when he became unemployed in October 2016. (Item 3) Applicant \nnoted in his 2017 SCA that he experienced periods of unemployment before he enlisted \nin the Marines. (Item 4) \n \n \nBased on credit bureau reports (CBR) from April 2017 and March 2018, the SOR \nalleged ten debts that became delinquent between 2012 and 2016, and totaled about \n$23,124. They included an automobile loan, a medical bill, a school loan, and credit card \ndebts. (Item 6, Item 7).   \n \n \nApplicant did not submit proof that he paid, is paying, or otherwise resolved any of \nthe five delinquent debts he admitted owing. He did not submit proof that he successfully \ndisputed any of the five delinquent debts that he denied owing, or proof that they are not \nhis debts. He did not provide evidence that he participated in credit or budgetary \ncounseling. He did not provide a budget or other information related to his financial \nobligations from which to determine current financial solvency. \n \n \n \n\n \nPersonal Conduct \n \n3 \n \n \n \n \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant did not disclose requested adverse information in \nhis 2017 SCA: the type of military discharge; any discipline he received while serving; \nand delinquent debts.  \n \n \n \nApplicant disclosed that he received an honorable discharge, and not a general \ndischarge under honorable conditions. He said he did not know the distinction between \nan honorable discharge and a general discharge under honorable conditions. (Item 3)  \n \n \nApplicant did not disclose that in 2010 he went to Non-Judicial Punishment (NJP) \nfor having violated Article 92 (failure to obey a lawful order or regulation), and two \nspecifications of Article 121 (larceny and wrongful appropriation). He and another Marine \nwrongfully took money from a wallet that had been turned into them while they were on \nduty. (Item 5) He was reduced in rank to E-2, forfeited $811 of pay for two months, and \nwas restricted for 60 days. (Item 8) Applicant stated that he forgot the date the NJP \noccurred, so he did not disclose it. (Item 3) \n \n \nApplicant stated that he did not disclose any delinquent debts, which were within \nthe seven-year timeline, because he did not know about them, and creditors had not \ncontacted him. (Item 3)  \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the pertinent AG. In addition to brief introductory \nexplanations of the security concern, the guidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions \nand mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s national \nsecurity eligibility. \n \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere speculation or \nconjecture.  \n\n \n \n4 \n \n \n \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14 requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \n \n \nA person applying for national security eligibility seeks to enter into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants national \nsecurity eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as \nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or sensitive information.  \n \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \n \n \nThe security concerns relating to the guideline for financial considerations are set \nout in AG \u00b6 18, which reads in pertinent part:       \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personal security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence.   \n \n \nAG \u00b6 19 describes two conditions that could raise security concerns and may be \ndisqualifying in this case:  \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \nApplicant has a history of being unable to meet financial obligations, which began \nin 2012 and continues into the present. The evidence raises security concerns under the \nabove disqualifying conditions, and shifts the burden to Applicant to rebut, extenuate, or \nmitigate those concerns.  \n \n \nThe guideline includes conditions in AG \u00b6 20 that could mitigate security concerns \narising from Applicant\u2019s financial problems. The following are potentially applicable: \n\n \n \n5 \n \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n \nApplicant\u2019s financial delinquencies are ongoing and there is insufficient evidence \nto demonstrate that similar problems will not recur in the future. AG \u00b6 20(a) does not \napply. Applicant attributed his financial delinquencies to being unemployed for a period \nof time after he left military service in 2012. That may have been a circumstance beyond \nhis control. However, he did not provide evidence that he attempted to responsibly \nmanage his financial obligations under those circumstance; thus, AG \u00b6 20(b) provides \nminimal mitigation. There is no documentary evidence that he participated in credit or \nfinancial counseling, or that any of the ten debts are paid and under control. He did not \nsubmit evidence that he initiated to a good-faith effort to resolve or repay overdue \ncreditors. The evidence does not establish mitigation under AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(c) or 20(d).  \n \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \n \nAG \u00b6 15 explains the security concerns relating to personal conduct: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes.  \n \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. One may be potentially disqualifying: \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \n\n \n \n6 \n \n \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \naward benefits or status, determine national security eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \n \nApplicant denied that he deliberately failed to disclose requested information \npertinent to the type of the military discharge he received; the 2010 NJP that he received; \nand the ten delinquent debts he had at the time he completed his 2017 SCA. None of his \nexplanations are sufficiently credible to justify his non-disclosure of the requested \ninformation. His assertions that he did not know he received a General discharge, and \ncould not remember the date of the NJP or the debts that he had been accumulating, are \nnot persuasive. His failure to disclose the information was deliberate. The evidence \nestablished disqualifying security concerns under AG \u00b6 16(a).  \n \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate the above security concerns. The \nfollowing are potentially applicable: \n \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to \nrecur; and \n \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability \nto exploitation, manipulation, or duress. \n \nApplicant did not provide evidence that would support mitigation under any of the \nforegoing conditions.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s national security eligibility by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct \nand all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \n\n \n \n7 \n \n \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national \nsecurity eligibility must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the applicable guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered \nthe potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all pertinent facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under Guideline \nF and Guideline E in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional comment. \n \n  \nDuring his June 2017 interview, Applicant discussed his delinquent debts. Despite \nbeing placed on notice that those debts created concerns for the Government at that time, \nhe took no action to resolve them. Applicant deliberately failed to disclose pertinent \nadverse information on his security clearance application. Overall, the record evidence \nleaves me with questions and doubts about Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a \nsecurity clearance. Applicant did not mitigate the financial considerations and personal \nconduct security concerns.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n       AGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.j:   \n    Against Applicant  \n \n \n \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \n       AGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a through 2.c:  \n    Against Applicant \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant access to classified \ninformation. National security eligibility is denied. \n                                           \n \n \n \n \nSHARI DAM  \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Available information is \nsufficient to mitigate the security concerns about Applicant\u2019s financial problems, and her \nrequest for a security clearance is granted. \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn October 25, 2016, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for \nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP) to obtain eligibility for a security clearance required for \nher employment with a federal contractor. Based on the results of the ensuing background \ninvestigation, Department of Defense (DOD) adjudicators could not determine that it is \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security for Applicant to have a security \n\n \n \n2 \n \n \nclearance, as required by Security Executive Agent Directive (SEAD) 4, Section E.4, and \nby DOD Directive 5220.6, as amended (Directive), Section 4.2. \n \n \nOn May 4, 2018, DOD issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging \nfacts that raise security concerns under the adjudicative guideline for financial \nconsiderations (Guideline F). The adjudicative guidelines cited in the SOR were issued \nby the Director of National Intelligence on December 10, 2016, to be effective for all \nadjudications on or after June 8, 2017. \n \n \nApplicant timely responded to the SOR (Answer) and requested a hearing before \nan administrative judge at the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA). I \nreceived the case on April 5, 2019, and I convened the requested hearing on May 21, \n2019. The parties appeared as scheduled, and DOHA received a transcript of the hearing \n(Tr.) on June 3, 2019. Department Counsel proffered Government Exhibits (GX) 1 \u2013 3. \nApplicant testified and proffered Applicant Exhibits (AX) A and B. All exhibits were \nadmitted without objection. One witness also testified for Applicant. Additionally, I held \nthe record open after the hearing to receive additional relevant information. The record \nclosed on June 10, 2019, after I received Applicant\u2019s post-hearing submission (AX C) and \nDepartment Counsel\u2019s waiver of objection to its admissibility. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nUnder Guideline F, the Government alleged that Applicant owed $23,985 for 22 \ndelinquent or past-due debts (SOR 1.a \u2013 1.v). Two of the allegations (SOR 1.b and 1.c) \naddressed unpaid student loans totaling $4,222, and 17 of the allegations (SOR 1.d, and \n1.g \u2013 1.v) addressed unpaid medical bills totaling $9,058. The largest single debt alleged \n(SOR 1.a) is for the $10,511 balance due, after resale, for an automobile that Applicant \nvoluntarily surrendered for repossession. In response to the SOR, Applicant admitted all \nof the allegations. (Answer) In addition to the facts established by Applicant\u2019s admissions, \nI make the following additional findings of fact. \n \n \nApplicant is 41 years old and was offered a position with a defense contractor in \nOctober 2016. That job is contingent on eligibility for a security clearance and would pay \nher about $65,000 annually. This is Applicant\u2019s first application for a security clearance. \nFor most of the preceding seven years, Applicant was a stay-at-home mother. Over the \npast two-and-a-half years, she has been self-employed as the owner of a house cleaning \nservice, from which she earns between $15,000 and $25,000 annually. Applicant has \nbeen married twice, most recently between May 2010 and August 2017, when she \ndivorced for the second time. Applicant\u2019s first husband, from whom Applicant was \nseparated for several years before a divorce was finalized in 2009, was in the military. \nShe and her second husband separated in May 2016, and they have three children (eight-\nyear-old twins and a six-year-old) together. Applicant also has an 18-year-old child from \nher first marriage. The twins live with Applicant\u2019s second husband and she pays $296 \neach month in child support. (GX 1; AX A; Tr. 27 \u2013 29, 31, 42, 46 \u2013 48) \n \n\n \n \n3 \n \n \n \nWhen Applicant and her second husband separated, she did not have enough \nincome from her house-cleaning business to make her car loan payments as required. \nThe $10,511 debt alleged at SOR 1.a arose after she called the dealer and surrendered \nthe car for repossession. Applicant presented information after the hearing showing she \nrepaid that debt between July and November 2018. (Answer; GX 1 \u2013 3; AX C; Tr. 33 \u2013 \n34) \n \n \nThe debts alleged at SOR 1.b and 1.c are for unpaid student loans Applicant \nobtained in 2008. She did not finish the degree or certification program for which she \nobtained the loans. It appears she was able to make her required payments until \nDecember 2016, seven months after she and her second husband separated. Applicant \ntestified she is now in the process of establishing an income-based student loan \nrehabilitation and repayment plan. Although she did not support her claims with any \ncorroborating information, I found her testimony credible. (Answer; GX 1 \u2013 3; Tr. 34 \u2013 37, \n43 \u2013 44) \n \n \nThe medical debts alleged at SOR 1.d and 1.g \u2013 1.v arose when the service \nproviders billed the wrong insurance company. Most of the medical care underlying those \ndebts was related to the birth of her twins in 2011, as well as more recent treatment of \nApplicant\u2019s strep throat. Applicant avers the hospital should have billed her current \nhusband\u2019s insurance, but billed her first husband\u2019s military insurance instead. Applicant \nwas able to correct the error after about two years; however, at that point her second \nhusband\u2019s insurance would not cover her claims. The debts at issue are less than seven \nyears old, yet the most recent credit reporting information in the record reflects only the \ndebt alleged at SOR 1.d. (Answer; GX 1 \u2013 3; AX B; Tr. 25 \u2013 26, 37 \u2013 38, 41) \n \n \nThe debts at SOR 1.e and 1.f are for unpaid cable television and/or internet \naccounts. Applicant claimed she has paid both debts, but she did not provide any \ndocumentation of those payments. (Answer; GX 2 and 3; AX B; Tr. 38) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s prospective supervisor testified on her behalf at the hearing. He has \nknown Applicant personally and professionally for about 15 years. At the end of \nApplicant\u2019s first marriage, she had worked in a non-defense industry position similar to \nthat for which she currently is being considered. The witness knew Applicant at that time \nand considers her a good fit for defense contractor employment. He characterized her as \nhard working, trustworthy, and honest. (Tr. 49 \u2013 52) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s current finances are sound. She has not incurred any new debts that \nshe is unable to pay, and she meets all of her regular monthly obligations as required. \n(Tr. 39 \u2013 40)   \n \nPolicies \n \n \nEach security clearance decision must be a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndetermination based on examination of all available relevant and material information, \n\n \n \n4 \n \n \nand consideration of the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in the adjudicative \nguidelines (AG). (See Directive, 6.3) Decisions must also reflect consideration of the \nfactors listed in \u00b6 2(d) of the guidelines. Commonly referred to as the \u201cwhole-person\u201d \nconcept, those factors are:  \n \n  \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nThe presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not \ndeterminative of a conclusion for or against an applicant. However, specific applicable \nguidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against them as they \nrepresent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to classified \ninformation. A security clearance decision is intended only to resolve whether it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest for an applicant to either receive or continue to have \naccess to classified information. (Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988))  \n \n \nThe Government bears the initial burden of producing admissible information on \nwhich it based the preliminary decision to deny or revoke a security clearance for an \napplicant. Additionally, the Government must be able to prove controverted facts alleged \nin the SOR. If the Government meets its burden, it then falls to the applicant to refute, \nextenuate or mitigate the Government\u2019s case. Because no one has a \u201cright\u201d to a security \nclearance, an applicant bears a heavy burden of persuasion. (See Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, \n531) A person who has access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship \nwith the Government based on trust and confidence. Thus, the Government has a \ncompelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgment, \nreliability and trustworthiness of one who will protect the national interests as his or her \nown. The \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any \nreasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the Government. \n(See Egan; AG \u00b6 2(b)) \n \nAnalysis \n \nFinancial Considerations  \n \n \nThe Government established that Applicant incurred delinquent or past-due debts, \ntotaling $23,985. The Government\u2019s information also showed that her debts remained \nunresolved as of May 2018. That information reasonably raises a security concern about \nApplicant\u2019s finances that is articulated at AG \u00b6 18: \n \n\n \n \n5 \n \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n \n \nMore specifically, available information requires application of the following AG \u00b6 \n19 disqualifying conditions: \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \n \nBy contrast, the record evidence as a whole also requires application of the \nfollowing AG \u00b6 20 mitigating conditions: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems stemmed, in part, from her 2016 marital separation \nand subsequent divorce in 2017. At that time, she was unable to continue paying her \nstudent loans and her car note. As to the latter, she presented documentation showing \nthe remainder after resale of her car has been paid off. As to her student loans, Applicant \ntestified credibly that she is in the process of establishing an income-based student loan \nrehabilitation and repayment plan. Finally, Applicant\u2019s claim that her delinquent medical \n\n \n \n6 \n \n \nbills resulted from insurance company billing errors was plausible. Her claims in this \nregard also have support in the absence of all but one of those debts from the most recent \navailable credit reporting information, despite the fact they are not old enough to have \nexceeded any credit reporting statute of limitations. Applicant\u2019s current finances are \nsound, and she has not incurred any new unpaid debts. All of the foregoing supports \napplication of the mitigating conditions at AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), 20(b), and 20(e). \n \nFinancial problems present a two-fold inquiry. First, does the ongoing presence of \nunpaid debt or other unresolved financial burdens present a likelihood that Applicant \nwould resort to illegal acts or other conduct that might compromise national interests? \nHere, that appears highly unlikely. Applicant appears to be living prudently on a limited \nself-employment income and her prospective supervisor testified that Applicant has a \nreputation for reliability and trustworthiness that tends to show she would not act counter \nto the national interest as a way of resolving her debts. \n \n \nSecond, did Applicant\u2019s financial problems arise from irresponsible decisions, poor \njudgment, or other factors that indicate she is unreliable or untrustworthy? I conclude they \ndid not. Applicant\u2019s financial problems were caused or exacerbated by the failure of her \nsecond marriage. She has paid off the largest of her debts and is in the midst of resolving \nher past-due student loans, which were current until the end of 2016. The record as a \nwhole establishes that the circumstances underlying her financial problems are unlikely \nto recur. On balance, available information shows she is resolving her debts and is \nsufficient to mitigate the security concerns raised by Applicant\u2019s financial problems. \nI also have evaluated this record in the context of the whole-person factors listed \nin AG \u00b6 2(d). Of note is the positive information about Applicant\u2019s character provided by \nher prospective supervisor. Additionally, Applicant\u2019s efforts to resolve her debts to the \nbest of her abilities reflect well on her judgment and reliability. A fair and commonsense \nassessment of the record evidence as a whole shows that Applicant has mitigated the \nsecurity concerns about his financial problems. \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by section \nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n Paragraph 1, Guideline F: \n FOR APPLICANT \n \n Subparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.v: \n For Applicant \n \n \n\n \n \n7 \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the foregoing, it is clearly consistent with the interests of national \nsecurity for Applicant to have access to classified information.

He has custody of his child, and they live at his parents\u2019 house.1 Applicant had periods of unemployment and underemployment before 2015. The amended SOR alleges two delinquent student loans in the amounts of $36,479 (SOR \u00b6 1.a) and $26,204 (SOR \u00b6 1.b), an unpaid judgment to a credit card provider for $5,335 (SOR \u00b6 1.c), and Applicant\u2019s failure to file state and federal income tax returns when they were due for 2017 (SOR \u00b6 1.d). However, the two student loans are duplicate accounts.2 Applicant stated that the judgment was paid in early 2017 through garnishment of his wages. He provided documentation that the judgment was paid and satisfied at some point before March 2018. Since May 2018, his pay has been garnished $451 twice a month for his student loan.

You failed to timely file your state and federal income tax returns for \ntax year 2017. \n \nThe motion was granted over Applicant\u2019s objection. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is a 38-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has worked for \nhis current employer, or a predecessor contractor, since April 2015. He attended college \nfor several years, but he has not earned a degree. He is single with one child. He has \ncustody of his child, and they live at his parents\u2019 house.1 \n \n \nApplicant had periods of unemployment and underemployment before 2015. The \namended SOR alleges two delinquent student loans in the amounts of $36,479 (SOR \u00b6 \n1.a) and $26,204 (SOR \u00b6 1.b), an unpaid judgment to a credit card provider for $5,335 \n(SOR \u00b6 1.c), and Applicant\u2019s failure to file state and federal income tax returns when \nthey were due for 2017 (SOR \u00b6 1.d). However, the two student loans are duplicate \naccounts.2 \n \n \nApplicant stated that the judgment was paid in early 2017 through garnishment of \nhis wages. He provided documentation that the judgment was paid and satisfied at \nsome point before March 2018. Since May 2018, his pay has been garnished $451 \ntwice a month for his student loan. He paid a total of $7,667 during that period, and he \nreduced the balance from $36,479 to $30,920.3 \n \n                                                          \n1 Tr. at 29, 41-44, 59; GE 1, 2.  \n \n2 Tr. at 29-30, 33-34, 43-45; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1-4.  \n \n3 Tr. at 30-31, 43, 49-51; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 3, 4; AE B, C.  \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \nApplicant filed his 2017 state and federal income tax returns in January 2019. He \nis due a $1,709 refund from the IRS, and he owes his state $3, which he assures he will \npay.4 \n \n \nApplicant admitted that he was negligent when he failed to file his tax returns on \ntime. He paid debts that were not alleged in the SOR before the SOR was issued. He \nstated that his current finances are sound, which is corroborated by the most recent \ncredit report in evidence. He has a good job that enables him to provide for his child. \nThe garnishment of his student loans was recently lifted. He credibly testified that he will \ncontinue to pay his student loans, file his tax returns on time, and maintain his financial \nstability. He has not received formal financial counseling.5 \n \n \nApplicant submitted a Questionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86) in \nAugust 2016. He did not report any financial issues on the questionnaire, but he \nreported derogatory information under other questions. He credibly denied intentionally \nproviding false information on the questionnaire. He stated that he had already made \narrangements to pay the debt that resulted in the judgment. The August 2016 credit \nreport listed the student loan as in deferment.6 I find that he did not intentionally provide \nfalse information of the SF 86.  \n \nPolicies \n \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified In6ormation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n                                                          \n4 Tr. at 34; Tr. 2 at 6; AE A.  \n \n5 Tr. at 33-37, 42, 47-48, 51-56; Tr. 2 at 6-9.  \n \n6 Tr. at 37-38, 56-58.  \n\n \n4 \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18:       \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n \n \n\n \n5 \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \n \n  \nApplicant has a history of financial problems, including an unpaid judgment, a \ndefaulted student loan, and income tax returns not filed on time. The evidence is \nsufficient to raise the above disqualifying conditions.  \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.c are duplicate student loans. When the same conduct is \nalleged twice in the SOR under the same guideline, one of the allegations should be \nresolved in Applicant\u2019s favor. See ISCR Case No. 03-04704 at 3 (App. Bd. Sep. 21, \n2005). SOR \u00b6 1.c is concluded for Applicant.  \n \n  \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n \n \nApplicant had periods of unemployment and underemployment before 2015. The \njudgment has been paid; the student loan is being paid; and the 2017 income tax \nreturns have been filed. Applicant receives less credit in mitigation because the \njudgment and student loan payments were made by garnishment. However, he also \npaid debts that were not alleged in the SOR before the SOR was issued. His statement \nthat his current finances are sound was corroborated by the most recent credit report in \nevidence. The garnishment of his student loans was recently lifted. He credibly testified \nthat he will continue to pay his student loans, file his tax returns on time, and maintain \nhis financial stability. He has a good job that enables him to provide for his child. He \n\n \n6 \n \nknows that a security clearance is crucial to keeping that job, and financial stability is \nrequired for him to keep his security clearance. Security concerns about Applicant\u2019s \nfinances are mitigated. \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct  \n \n  \nThe security concern for personal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 15, as follows: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \n  \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying condition is potentially applicable: \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \n \n \nApplicant did not intentionally provide false information about his finances on his \n2016 SF 86. AG \u00b6 16(a) has not been established. SOR \u00b6 2.a is concluded for \nApplicant.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the \n\n \n7 \n \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuidelines E and F in my whole-person analysis.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant refuted \nthe personal conduct security concerns, and he mitigated the financial considerations \nsecurity concerns.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.d: \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIt is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n \n________________________ \nEdward W. Loughran \nAdministrative Judge \n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact The SOR alleges under Guideline F that Applicant failed to timely file his federal income tax returns for tax years 2014 through 2016 (SOR \u00b6 1.a), and that as of July 6, 2018, he owed charged-off balances of $17,381 (SOR \u00b6 1.b) and $892 (SOR \u00b6 1.d) to a credit union, and collection balances of $1,121 (SOR \u00b6 1.c) and $328 (SOR \u00b6 1.e) to the U.S. government. In his Answer to the SOR (Item 2), Applicant indicated that his tax returns for tax years 2014 through 2015 have been filed and he had paid off the $1,121 debt in 2016. He admitted that he owed the credit union, but indicated that he had been repaying the debts on a monthly basis. Applicant denied the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.e based on lack of knowledge. After considering the FORM, which includes Applicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR (Item 2), and AE A, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant is 30 years old and unmarried. He has attended college but has not earned a degree. He served honorably on active duty in the U.S. military from August 2006 to August 2012, and he held a DOD secret clearance granted to him in 2006. He was in the active reserve from October 2014 until March 2017, when he was given a general discharge under honorable conditions. He was not able to fulfill his drill service on the scheduled dates because he was either working out of the country or attending school in a distant state. (Items 4, 7.) On his discharge from active duty, Applicant lived with his parents and was unemployed for a year. ",

Karoian, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n03/05/2019 \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nMATCHINSKI, Elizabeth M., Administrative Judge: \n \n \nApplicant was not timely in filing his federal income tax returns for tax years 2014 \nthrough 2016, and he became seriously delinquent on two loans and on a debt owed to the \ngovernment. He is credited with making payments toward his delinquent debts, but he still \nowes more than $15,000 on a defaulted car loan. His income tax returns for 2015 and \n2016 were not filed until they became an issue for his security clearance eligibility. \nClearance is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \n \nOn July 6, 2018, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility \n(DOD CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, detailing a security \nconcern under Guideline F, financial considerations. The SOR explained why the DOD \nCAF was unable to find it clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue \nsecurity clearance eligibility for him. The DOD CAF took the action under Executive Order \n(EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the National Security Adjudicative \n \n\n2 \n \nGuidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to \nHold a Sensitive Position (AG) effective within the DOD on June 8, 2017. \n \nOn July 17, 2018, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations and requested a \ndecision based on the written record by an administrative judge from the Defense Office of \nHearings and Appeals (DOHA). On October 15, 2018, the Government submitted a File of \nRelevant Material (FORM), consisting of seven exhibits (Items 1-7). DOHA forwarded a \ncopy of the FORM to Applicant, and instructed him to respond within 30 days of receipt. \nApplicant received the FORM on October 29, 2018. The deadline for his rebuttal to the \nFORM was extended to December 14, 2018. On December 3, 2018, Applicant submitted a \ntimely response that was accepted without any objections by the Government on \nDecember 4, 2018. On January 30, 2019, the case was assigned to me to determine \nwhether it is clearly consistent with national security to grant or continue a security \nclearance for Applicant. I received the case assignment on February 4, 2019, and \naccepted Applicant\u2019s FORM response in the record as Applicant Exhibit (AE) A. \n \nFindings of Fact \n  \n  \nThe SOR alleges under Guideline F that Applicant failed to timely file his federal \nincome tax returns for tax years 2014 through 2016 (SOR \u00b6 1.a), and that as of July 6, \n2018, he owed charged-off balances of $17,381 (SOR \u00b6 1.b) and $892 (SOR \u00b6 1.d) to a \ncredit union, and collection balances of $1,121 (SOR \u00b6 1.c) and $328 (SOR \u00b6 1.e) to the \nU.S. government. In his Answer to the SOR (Item 2), Applicant indicated that his tax \nreturns for tax years 2014 through 2015 have been filed and he had paid off the $1,121 \ndebt in 2016. He admitted that he owed the credit union, but indicated that he had been \nrepaying the debts on a monthly basis. Applicant denied the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.e based on \nlack of knowledge.  After considering the FORM, which includes Applicant\u2019s Answer to the \nSOR (Item 2), and AE A, I make the following findings of fact. \n \nApplicant is 30 years old and unmarried. He has attended college but has not \nearned a degree. He served honorably on active duty in the U.S. military from August 2006 \nto August 2012, and he held a DOD secret clearance granted to him in 2006. He was in the \nactive reserve from October 2014 until March 2017, when he was given a general \ndischarge under honorable conditions. He was not able to fulfill his drill service on the \nscheduled dates because he was either working out of the country or attending school in a \ndistant state. (Items 4, 7.) \n \nOn his discharge from active duty, Applicant lived with his parents and was \nunemployed for a year. From August 2013 to May 2014, he attended college full time. In \nJuly 2014, he began working as a weapons technician for a defense contractor. (Item 4; AE \nA.) Applicant earned $18,341 in wages from July 2014 through December 2014. He \nallowed the April 15, 2015 deadline for filing his federal income tax return for tax year 2014 \nto pass without filing his tax return.1 (AE A.) He cites his focus on completing his tasks as a \n                                                 \n1 The SOR does not allege a failure to file state income tax returns. A record of the state tax authority indicates \nthat Applicant does not have a filing requirement for tax years 2014 through 2017, and no tax liabilities or \npending tax assessments for those tax years. (Item 5.) \n\n3 \n \nweapons technician, the difficulty in transitioning from the military to civilian life, and fear of \nlosing his new job as the reasons why he \u201cneglected to start on [his] taxes on time.\u201d \nApplicant acknowledges that it was irresponsible of him to not file his return on time. (AE \nA.) \n \nIn mid-September 2015, Applicant began working remotely as a weapons technician \nfor another company at an hourly wage of $14.50. He was paid $1,000 to assist him with \nhis relocation expenses. (Item 4; AE A.) While living and working outside of the United \nStates until May 2016, Applicant filed his federal income tax return for 2014 on April 15, \n2016. On his wages of $18,341, he overpaid his federal income taxes by $1,391. The IRS \napplied $1,292.94 of his tax refund to his tax liability for tax year 2013. Applicant did not file \nhis federal income tax return for tax year 2015 by the April 18, 2016 deadline for that \nreturn. (Item 5; AE A.) \n \nAbout six months into his new job, Applicant decided to continue his college studies \ntoward a degree in electrical engineering. (AE A.) In May 2016, Applicant resigned from his \njob without giving the required two-week notice, and he enrolled in college in the United \nStates. He had to repay the $1,000 to his former employer because he did not stay in his \njob for a year. (Item 4; AE A.) In June 2016, he paid two debts, of $1,121 and $125 in \ngovernment overpayments (SOR \u00b6 1.c), that were in collections. He used funds from his GI \nbill and student financial aid to pay the debts. (Items 2, 5-7.) \n \nApplicant was unemployed while a full-time student from May 2016 to May 2017.  \nHe became seriously delinquent on an auto loan that he obtained for $28,091 in November \n2014 for a 2013 model-year vehicle. The loan was to be repaid at $565 a month for five \nyears. The loan became seriously delinquent in September 2016 because he lacked \nincome to make the payments. The creditor repossessed the vehicle and sold it. A past-\ndue deficiency balance of $17, 984 was charged off in January 2017 (SOR \u00b6 1. b). (Items \n5-7.) \n \nIn May 2017, Applicant began working for a defense contractor as a maintenance \ntechnician. On May 16, 2017, Applicant completed and certified to the accuracy of a \nQuestionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86). He responded negatively to the \nfinancial record inquiries, including to questions regarding whether he had failed to file or \npay federal, state, or other taxes within the last seven years; whether he had defaulted on \nany loans in the last seven years; and whether he had any bills or debts turned over for \ncollection in the last seven years. (Item 4.) \n \nA check of Applicant\u2019s credit on July 22, 2017, revealed that Applicant owed a \ncharged-off balance of $17,984 on the auto loan; that the same credit union had placed a \n$1,460 charged-off balance for collection after nonpayment since January 2017 (SOR \u00b6 \n1.d); that a personal loan had been charged off for $2,311 in July 2016 but paid in \ncollection (not alleged in SOR); that a $265 insurance debt had been in collection since \nMay 2015 (not alleged in SOR); and that a $181 utility services debt was placed for \ncollection in December 2015 (not alleged in SOR). (Item 7.)  Applicant had repayment \nplans in place with the credit union to address his debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.d. On June 9, \n\n4 \n \n2017, he arranged to repay the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.d, which was a personal loan taken out to \npay living expenses, at $100 a month. On July 3, 2017, Applicant agreed to make \npayments of $200 a month toward his auto loan deficiency. (Item 2.)  \n \nOn January 9, 2018, Applicant was interviewed by an authorized investigator for the \nOffice of Personnel Management (OPM). When asked whether he had failed to file or pay \nfederal, state, or other taxes on time, Applicant indicated that he had not yet filed his \nfederal income tax return for tax year 2016, but that he had received an extension to April \n2018 from the IRS.2  When asked about any debt to the federal government, Applicant \nindicated that he had paid the government creditor named in SOR \u00b6 1.c. The debts arose \nbecause of overpayments that he recalled receiving in May 2016. He explained that he \npaid the debts to clear his credit history for the security clearance required for his \nemployment. He described his current financial situation as poor. He had other financial \nissues that were being repaid, including the loans in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.d. When confronted \nabout the insurance debt in collection on his credit report, Applicant indicated that he had \npaid that debt in April 2017. The debt was for insurance on his repossessed vehicle. He \nalso related that, in April 2017, he had paid the $2,311 defaulted loan in collection. \nApplicant did not recognize the $181 collection debt for utility services that was on his \ncredit record. Applicant was given five business days to provide documentation confirming \npayment or repayment arrangements for his debts. (Item 5.) There is no evidence that he \nprovided evidence of payments or payment arrangements within the five days. \n \nAs of March 9, 2018, Applicant\u2019s credit report from Equifax reflected outstanding \nbalances of $17,381 on his defaulted auto loan (SOR \u00b6 1.b) and $892 on the personal loan \nwith the credit union (SOR \u00b6 1.d). A government debt of $328 (SOR \u00b6 1.e) from July 2017 \nwas in collection. His credit report had not been updated to show the repayment of the debt \nin SOR \u00b6 1.c. No other delinquencies were on his credit report. (Item 6.) \n \nDOHA sent interrogatories to Applicant asking in part whether he had ever failed to \nfile his federal income tax returns on time. On June 18, 2018, Applicant responded \naffirmatively and indicated that he had yet to file his federal and state income tax returns \nfor tax years 2015 and 2016, but that he had no outstanding federal or state tax liabilities. \nAccount transcripts from the IRS showed that he filed his federal income tax return for tax \nyear 2014 on April 15, 2016, but that he had yet to file his federal income tax returns for tax \nyears 2015, 2016, and 2017 as of June 12, 2018. (Item 5.) \n \nOn July 6, 2018, the DOD CAF issued the SOR to Applicant because of his failure to \ntimely file federal income tax returns for tax years 2014 through 2016 and because of \nconsumer credit delinquencies totaling $19,722. (Item 1.) In response to the SOR, on July \n17, 2018, Applicant provided documentation from the credit union showing that he was in \ncompliance with his repayments on the loans in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.d. He had made \n                                                 \n2 Applicant did not provide any corroborating documentation to support his claim that he had an extension of \nthe filing deadline for tax year 2016 to April 2018, which was beyond the October 2017 extended deadline to \nwhich he would have been entitled had he filed Form 4848 on or before the April 18, 2017 tax-filing deadline \nfor tax year 2016. \n \n\n5 \n \npayments to reduce the respective loan balances to $16,181.43 and $392.34 as of July 17, \n2018. Applicant provided documentation corroborating his claimed resolution of the debt in \nSOR \u00b61.c in 2016. Applicant denied any knowledge of the $328 government debt in SOR \u00b6 \n1.e. He asserted that his delinquent federal income tax returns for tax years 2014 through \n2016 (Item 2.) \n \nOn October 15, 2018, DOHA sent Applicant a FORM in response to his request for \na decision based on the written record.3 In rebuttal to the FORM, Applicant submitted IRS \naccount transcripts dated August 21, 2018, which showed that he filed his federal income \ntax return for tax year 2014 on April 15, 2016, but that he had not filed his federal income \ntax returns as of his July 17, 2018 response to the SOR allegations. He filed his federal \nincome tax return for tax year 2015 on August 5, 2018, more than two years beyond the \ntax-filing deadline of April 18, 2016. On adjusted gross income of $44,280, Applicant \nunderpaid his federal income taxes by $938. He filed his federal income tax return for tax \nyear 2016 on August 7, 2018, more than a year after the tax-filing deadline of April 18, \n2017. On adjusted gross income of $15,654, he owes $365 in federal taxes for 2016. On \nAugust 3, 2018, Applicant filed his income tax return for tax year 2017. His income tax \nreturn was due on April 17, 2018, unless he applied for an extension of the deadline to \nOctober 2018. There is no evidence that he filed a Form 4868 requesting an extension. On \nadjusted gross income of $40,447 for tax year 2017, Applicant overpaid his federal income \ntaxes by $2,841. (AE A.) \n \nRegarding his late tax filings for tax years 2015 through 2017, Applicant explained \nthat he could not file his income tax returns until he paid the $1,000 owed his previous \nemployer and he could not afford to do so: \n \nThe islands policy was for me to stay at least one year in the country to keep \nthe $1,000 payment. I then owed this amount back to [his previous \nemployer]. It was mainly this exact situation in filing my taxes 2015, 2016 and \n2017 became a struggle. I have always filed my taxes through Turbo Tax. As \nI attempted to do so the site informed me that nothing could be done to file \ntaxes until that debt was paid off. I was not making a sufficient amount of \nincome at that time, and could not afford to pay off the debt in one whole \npayment. Between rent and food it was difficult to manage this debt. \nBetween 2015 through 2017 income has been straining my ability to pay this \ndebt and getting the taxes filed on time. \n \nMy last resort was to talk to tax preparer [name and email omitted] and seek \nadvice how to tackle this situation. He advised me after 3 years of not \nknowing that I can indeed file all of my taxes through him without having to \npay my $1,000 dollar first. I finally completed them all. I now have a high \npaying job to manage any debt now. (AE A.) \n \n                                                 \n3 The FORM was sent to Applicant through an employer other than that listed on his August 2016 SF 86. No \ninformation was provided about when Applicant changed employers or about his income with his current \nemployer other than his statement that he has a high-paying job. See AE A. \n\n6 \n \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion the Executive \nBranch has in regulating access to information pertaining to national security,  emphasizing \nthat \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, \nthe administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be considered in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. These guidelines \nare not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, \nthese guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative \nprocess. The administrative judge\u2019s overall adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative \njudge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, \nfavorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence \nto establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant \nis responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation about potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7 of EO 10865 \nprovides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section \n3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information). \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \n \n \nThe security concerns about financial considerations are articulated in AG \u00b6 18: \n \n\n7 \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness \nto abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or \nsensitive information. Financial distress can also be caused or exacerbated \nby, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other issues of personnel security \nconcern such as excessive gambling, mental health conditions, substance \nmisuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . . \n \nThe Appeal Board explained the scope and rationale for the financial considerations \nsecurity concern in ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) (citation omitted) \nas follows: \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money in satisfaction of \nhis or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the totality of an \napplicant\u2019s financial history and circumstances. The Judge must consider \npertinent evidence regarding the applicant\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other \nqualities essential to protecting the national secrets as well as the \nvulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive presumes a \nnexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines and an \napplicant\u2019s security eligibility. \n \n \nApplicant admits that he defaulted on two loans with a credit union and on two debts \nresulting from government overpayment, although only the larger debt of $1,121 was \nalleged in the SOR. His March 2018 credit report includes a $328 collection debt to the \ngovernment, which has been past due since July 2017. He disputes the debt (SOR \u00b6 1.e) \nbased on lack of knowledge. \n \nUnder \u00b6 E3.1.14 of the Directive, the government has the burden of presenting \nevidence to establish controverted facts.  The Appeal Board held in ISCR Case No. 08-\n12184 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan. 7, 2010) that a credit report is sufficient to meet the \ngovernment\u2019s burden of producing evidence of delinquency: \n \nIt is well-settled that adverse information from a credit report can normally \nmeet the substantial evidence standard and the government\u2019s obligations \nunder [Directive] \u00b6 E3.1.14 for pertinent allegations. At that point, the burden \nshifts to applicant to establish either that [he or] she is not responsible for the \ndebt or that matters in mitigation apply. \n \nApplicant submitted no documentation to indicate the debt is not his responsibility. \nWhether he owes the debt or it was erroneously reported on Applicant\u2019s credit, the other \ndelinquencies in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b-1.d are sufficient to establish AG \u00b6 19(a), \u201cinability to satisfy \ndebts,\u201d and AG \u00b6 19(c), \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d \n\n8 \n \nThe evidence shows that Applicant did not timely file his federal income tax returns \nfor tax years 2014 through 2016 as alleged in the SOR. He filed his federal income tax \nreturn for tax year 2014 in April 2016, a year after it was due. He inexplicably claimed \nduring his January 2018 OPM interview that he had an extension to April 2018 to file his \nfederal income tax return for tax year 2016, which would have been beyond even the \nextended deadline for that tax year. His federal income tax returns for tax years 2015 and \n2016 were not filed until August 2018, after he received the SOR. His federal income tax \nreturn for tax year 2017 may well have also been filed belatedly, although his August 2018 \nfiling would have been within the extended deadline of October 2018. There is no evidence \nthat he filed the Form 4868 needed to request an extension of the filing deadline. Even so, \nthe Government did not allege late filing for tax year 2017 and so it cannot be considered \nin disqualification. However, it is properly considered for other purposes, such as \nassessing his reform.4 \n  \n \nIRS transcripts show that Applicant overpaid his federal income taxes for tax year \n2014 by $1,391, although $1,292.94 was applied to his tax liability for tax year 2013. He \nunderpaid his federal income taxes for tax year 2015 by $938 and his federal income taxes \nfor tax year 2016 by $365. Guideline F security concerns are established when an \nindividual fails to comply with his tax filing obligations whether or not any taxes are owed. \nDisqualifying condition AG \u00b6 19(f), \u201cfailure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, \nor local income tax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired,\u201d applies. \n \nThe burden is on Applicant to mitigate the negative implications for his financial \njudgment raised by his failure to timely comply with his income tax filing obligation for three \nconsecutive years and by his seriously delinquent debts. Application of the aforesaid \ndisqualifying conditions triggers consideration of the potentially mitigating conditions under \nAG \u00b6 20. Six of the seven mitigating conditions warrant some consideration and could \npotentially apply in whole or in part. They are: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under \nsuch circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n                                                 \n4 In ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006), the Appeal Board listed five circumstances in \nwhich conduct not alleged in a SOR may be considered, as follows: \n \n(a) to assess an applicant\u2019s credibility; (b) to evaluate an applicant\u2019s evidence of extenuation, \nmitigation, or changed circumstances; (c) to consider whether an applicant has demonstrated \nsuccessful rehabilitation; (d) to decide whether a particular provision of the Adjudicative \nGuidelines is applicable; or (e) to provide evidence for the whole-person analysis under \nDirective Section 6.3. \n\n9 \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem from a \nlegitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit counseling service, \nand there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under \ncontrol; \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue; and \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n \n \nApplicant defaulted on the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b-1.d in 2016. Available credit \ninformation shows that the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.e was placed for collection in July 2017. The \ndelinquencies did not occur so long ago to be mitigated under AG \u00b6 20(a). AG \u00b6 20(b) also \ndoes not apply because the loss of income that led him to default on the debts was within \nhis control. Applicant decided to quit working and return to college as a full-time student. \nWhile his decision to resume his education is considered an investment in his future, he \nknowingly put his self-interest ahead of his financial responsibilities.  \n \n \nApplicant has a case for some mitigation of his consumer delinquencies under AG \n\u00b6\u00b6 20(c) and 20(d), however. He satisfied the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.c in June 2016. In the \nsummer of 2017, he entered into repayment arrangements with the credit union to address \nhis defaulted car loan (SOR \u00b6 1.b) and personal loan (SOR \u00b6 1.d). He paid $2,900 over the \nnext year to reduce the balance of the car loan to $16,181.43. He paid $2,000 over the \nnext year to reduce the balance of the personal loan to $392.34 as of mid-July 2018. The \ncreditor confirms that he was in compliance with his payment arrangements toward both \ndebts. \n \n \nAn applicant is not required, as a matter of law, to establish that he has paid off \nevery debt in the SOR. He is required to demonstrate that he has established a plan to \nresolve his financial problems and taken significant actions to implement the plan. See \nISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008) (internal citations and quotation \nmarks omitted). Given Applicant\u2019s track record of payments on his defaulted loans with the \ncredit union, he is likely to have continued his payments. Based on his established \npayment plans, the personal loan in SOR \u00b6 1.d has likely been fully satisfied by the close of \nthe record in December 2018, although Applicant did not address the debt when he \nresponded to the FORM. Assuming he made monthly payments of $200 toward the car \nloan deficiency balance (SOR \u00b6 1.b), he would have reduced that debt by another $1,000 \nto approximately $15,000, which is still a sizeable delinquency. He indicated in response to \nthe FORM that he now has a high-paying job to manage any debts, but he provided no \n\n10 \n \ndetails about his income or expenses, so it is difficult to conclude when he will pay off the \ndebt. However, he has demonstrated a good-faith effort to address that debt under AG \u00b6 \n20(d). He established a track record of payments toward the debt before the SOR was \nissued, although there is no evidence that he has had any financial counseling, which is \nrequired for full mitigation under AG \u00b6 20(c). Neither AG \u00b6 20(c) nor AG \u00b6 20(d) can \nreasonably apply to the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.e. Applicant has not made any effort to even \ninvestigate the debt which is on his credit report.  His denial based on a lack of knowledge \nis not enough to successfully dispute it under AG \u00b6 20(e). \n \n \nRegarding Applicant\u2019s federal tax issues, his belated filing of his income tax returns \nfor tax years 2014 through 2016 is some indication that the problem of his noncompliance \nwith his tax-filing obligation \u201cis being resolved or is under control\u201d under AG \u00b6 20(c). Even \nwhere tax problems have been corrected and an applicant is motivated to prevent such \nproblems in the future, the administrative judge is not precluded from considering an \napplicant\u2019s trustworthiness in light of longstanding prior behavior evidencing irresponsibility. \nSee e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 2015). The Appeal Board has long \nheld that the failure to file tax returns suggests a problem with complying with well-\nestablished government rules and systems. See e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-04437 (App. Bd. \nApr. 15, 2016.) \n \n \nMoreover, the Appeal Board has reaffirmed that the timing of the corrective action is \nan appropriate factor to consider in applying AG \u00b6 20(g). See e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-\n01382 at 4 (App. Bd. May 16, 2018) (citing ISCR Case No. 17-01807 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Mar. \n7, 2018)). In reversing favorable clearance grants to applicants with tax issues by DOHA \njudges in ISCR Case No. 17-01382 (App. Bd. May 16, 2018) and ISCR Case No. 16-01211 \n(App. Bd. May 30, 2018), the Appeal Board noted that applicants who only begin to \naddress their delinquent tax returns after having been placed on notice that their clearance \nmight be in jeopardy may not comply with laws, rules, and regulations when their \nimmediate interests are not imperiled. Applicant did not disclose on his SF 86 that he had \ndelinquent tax returns that had not been filed. When the OPM investigator asked him about \nany tax issues in January 2018, Applicant admitted that he had yet to file his 2016 tax \nreturn, although he failed to disclose that he had not filed his 2015 federal income tax \nreturn as well. He knew or should have known then that his federal tax returns were an \nissue for his clearance, and he did not file his tax returns for tax years 2015 and 2016 until \nAugust 2018, after he received the SOR. He claimed in rebuttal to the FORM that Turbo \nTax would not permit him to file his delinquent returns before he paid a $1,000 debt that he \nowed to a former employer. The more likely scenario is that Applicant used Turbo Tax to \ncomplete his 2015 federal income tax return and learned that he underpaid his income \ntaxes by $938, as shown on the IRS transcript. He could not pay the debt and so did not \nfile his return. Even assuming that he in good faith believed that he could not file his federal \nincome tax returns before he paid that debt, he did not adequately explain why he waited to \nconsult with a professional tax preparer. Applicant has yet to demonstrate a track record of \ncompliance with tax-filing deadlines. According to IRS transcripts, he owes $938 for tax \nyear 2015 and $365 for tax year 2017. There is no evidence that he has paid those debts. \nConcerns persist about his reform of his federal income tax issues. \n\n11 \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nIn assessing the whole person, the administrative judge must consider the totality of \nan applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative \nprocess factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). The analysis under Guideline F is incorporated in my whole-\nperson analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were addressed under that guideline, but \nsome warrant additional comment. \n \nApplicant\u2019s active duty service in the U.S. military is viewed favorably. His difficulty in \nfinding a good-paying job after his discharge does not excuse or mitigate his failure to file \ntimely tax returns. He earned $44,280 in 2015, $15,654 in 2016, but $40,447 in 2017, \nwhich was well over the minimum threshold required for filing. Applicant was not fully \ncandid about his noncompliance with his income tax filing obligations. \n \n \nThe security clearance adjudication involves an evaluation of an applicant\u2019s \njudgment, reliability, and trustworthiness in light of the security guidelines in the Directive. \nSee ISCR Case No. 09-02160 (App. Bd. Jun. 21, 2010). It is not intended as a debt \ncollection process or designed to punish applicants for past mistakes or shortcomings. At \nthe same time, Applicant owes a considerable debt to a credit union. His repeated \nnoncompliance with his tax-filing obligation raises significant security concerns about \nwhether he can be counted on to abide by laws, rules, and regulations. It is well settled that \nonce a concern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility, there is a \nstrong presumption against the grant or renewal of a security clearance. See Dorfmont v. \nBrown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th Cir. 1990). For the reasons noted above, I am unable to \nconclude that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant access to \nclassified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.b-1.d: \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.e:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n\n12 \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance. Clearance is \ndenied. \n \n \n_____________________ \nElizabeth M. Matchinski \nAdministrative Judge \n",

He denied the allegation in SOR \u00b6 1.d.1 (Item 3) Applicant is 57 years old. He is divorced twice and has two adult children. He served in the Army from 1980 to 2004, and received an honorable discharge. He held a security clearance while in the Army. He has worked for federal contractors since 2004. In 2014, he was granted an interim security clearance. (Item 4) In his August 2017 SCA, Applicant stated that in June 2017 he used marijuana for the first time to alleviate arthritic pain. He said his physician was going to issue him a medical certificate to use it, so he decided to try it before that. On June 30, 2017, his employer notified him that he tested positive for marijuana on his recent drug urinalysis and was required to enroll in a mandatory Employee Assistance Program (EAP) starting July 6, 2017. He was placed on a leave of absence from July 3, to August 2, 2017, and required to complete some form of treatment.2 He stated that he is now required to participate in a five-year drug treatment program, beginning on July 27, 2017, and continuing to July 27, 2022. He explained that his employer requires him to be drug free during those years.

DeAngelis, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n06/07/2019 \n \n \n______________ \n \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nDAM, Shari, Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant failed to mitigate the drug involvement and substance misuse, and \npersonal conduct security concerns, related to his use of marijuana while holding a \nsecurity clearance, and his failure to fully disclose it on his security clearance application \nand during an investigative interview. Based on the pleadings and exhibits, national \nsecurity eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \nHistory of Case \n \nOn August 10, 2017, Applicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA). \nOn July 2, 2018, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility (DoD \nCAF) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging security concerns under \nGuideline H (Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse) and Guideline E (Personal \nConduct). The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DoD Directive 5220.6, \nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive); and the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining \nEligibility for Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position \n(AG) effective within the DoD on June 8, 2017. \n\n \n \n \n \n2\n \nApplicant filed an Answer to the SOR on September 11, 2018, and elected to have \nhis case decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. On March 20, 2019, \nDepartment Counsel submitted the Government\u2019s File of Relevant Material (FORM), \ncontaining seven Items. Applicant received the FORM on March 27, 2019. He was \nafforded an opportunity to file objections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, \nor mitigation within 30 days of receipt of the FORM. Applicant did not provide a response \nto the FORM, object to the Government\u2019s evidence, or submit documents. Hence, all \nItems are admitted into evidence. The case was assigned to me on May 29, 2019.  \n  \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant admitted the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 1.c, 1.e, 2.a, and 2.b. He \ndenied the allegation in SOR \u00b6 1.d.1 (Item 3) \n \n \nApplicant is 57 years old. He is divorced twice and has two adult children. He \nserved in the Army from 1980 to 2004, and received an honorable discharge. He held a \nsecurity clearance while in the Army. He has worked for federal contractors since 2004. \nIn 2014, he was granted an interim security clearance. (Item 4) \n \n \nIn his August 2017 SCA, Applicant stated that in June 2017 he used marijuana for \nthe first time to alleviate arthritic pain. He said his physician was going to issue him a \nmedical certificate to use it, so he decided to try it before that. On June 30, 2017, his \nemployer notified him that he tested positive for marijuana on his recent drug urinalysis \nand was required to enroll in a mandatory Employee Assistance Program (EAP) starting \nJuly 6, 2017. He was placed on a leave of absence from July 3, to August 2, 2017, and \nrequired to complete some form of treatment.2 He stated that he is now required to \nparticipate in a five-year drug treatment program, beginning on July 27, 2017, and \ncontinuing to July 27, 2022. He explained that his employer requires him to be drug free \nduring those years. (Items 4, 5, 6) \n \n   \nDuring a December 2017 interview, Applicant told an investigator that on June 23, \n2017, he used marijuana to relieve arthritic pain in his back. He said his doctor had offered \nto prescribe him a medical marijuana card, but Applicant refused because it was \nprohibited under federal law and his employer\u2019s policies. He stated that on June 26, 2017, \nhe was randomly selected for a drug urinalysis. On June 30, 2017, his employer notified \nhim that he tested positive for marijuana and was ordered not to return to work, beginning \non July 3, 2017. He was off work for 30 days and had to take another drug urinalysis on \nJuly 24, 2017. Those results were negative and he returned to work on August 2, 2017. \n(Item 6) \n                                            \n1 Applicant denied that he tested positive for marijuana on June 28, 2017, as alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.d. \nHe admitted that it was July 5, 2017, as alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.e. He asserted he only tested positive once \nduring the June to July 2017 timeframe. There is confusion in this record as to the correct date of his positive \nurinalysis in 2017. I find that the date of the positive drug screen was in June 2017, which is consistent with \nthe preponderance of the evidence, including his SCA, interview, and interrogatories. (Item 6)  \n \n2 There is no information describing the components of this mandatory treatment program. \n\n \n \n \n \n3\n \n \nOn May 10, 2018, a government investigator obtained Applicant\u2019s medical records. \nThe records documented that Applicant had been using marijuana from approximately \nOctober 2015 until July 2017, during which time he held a security clearance. According \nto the medical records, Applicant\u2019s physician prescribed him Tramadol, and required him \nto refrain from alcohol or marijuana use while using this drug. On October 14, 2015, he \ntested positive for marijuana. Subsequently, Applicant acknowledged to his physician in \nwriting that he would not use alcohol or marijuana and agreed to random drug testing \nordered by his physician to confirm abstinence. Despite his promise, he tested positive \nfor both marijuana and alcohol on January 22, 2016, and March 22, 2016. He later \nreported to his physician that he discontinued marijuana use, but his subsequent drug \ntest in June 2017 again tested positive for marijuana. (Items 3, 7) \n \n \nOn June 12, 2018, Applicant completed a set of government interrogatories. He \nreported that he had used marijuana only once, on June 26, 2017. He admitted that he \nfailed a drug test, but stated he had no intention of using marijuana again. He submitted \na Certificate of Completion of an eight-hour drug and alcohol awareness class in July \n2017, while on his leave of absence. He wrote that he had recently taken cortisone shots \nfor his arthritic pain and participated in physical therapy, both of which were alleviating \nhis pain. (Item 6) \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations \nfor each guideline, the AG list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating \nconditions, which are to be used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility. \n \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere speculation or \nconjecture.  \n \n \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14 requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states that an \u201capplicant is \n\n \n \n \n \n4\nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \n \n \nA person applying for national security eligibility seeks to enter into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants national \nsecurity eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as \nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or sensitive information.  \n \n \nFinally, as emphasized in Section 7 of Executive Order 10865, \u201c[a]ny determination \nunder this order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information.) \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline H: Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \n \n \nAG \u00b6 24 describes the concerns related to drug involvement and substance \nmisuse: \n \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" as \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in \nthis guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \n \nAG \u00b6 25 sets out three conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying: \n \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); \n \n(b) testing positive for an illegal drug; and \n \n(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or \nholding a sensitive position. \n\n \n \n \n \n5\n \nApplicant used marijuana from October 2015 until June 2017, and tested positive \nfor using the illegal drug in October 2015, January 2016, and June 2017. He was working \nfor a federal contractor at that time and held a security clearance. The evidence \nestablished the above disqualifying conditions. \n \nAG \u00b6 26 lists conditions that could mitigate security concerns raised under this \nguideline. Three may potentially apply: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: \n \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; \nand \n \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility; and \n \n(d) satisfactory completion of a prescribed drug treatment program, \nincluding, but not limited to, rehabilitation and aftercare requirements, \nwithout recurrence of abuse, and a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified \nmedical professional. \n \n \nApplicant did not present evidence to establish mitigation under any of the above \nconditions. He used marijuana from October 2015 into June 2017, and the last alleged \nincident having occurred about two years ago. There is insufficient evidence to conclude \nthat his illegal use of marijuana happened under unusual circumstances, such that it does \nnot cast doubt on his current trustworthiness. He consistently lied to the Government \nabout the extent of his marijuana use during this investigation, until the Government \nreviewed his medical records, which documented a history of marijuana abuse that was \nagainst, not consistent with, his doctor\u2019s advice. He did not voluntarily admit or \nacknowledge that he has a drug problem. He participated in an EAP, which included an \neight-hour substance awareness course. There is no other evidence describing the \nelements of that program or indicating that he was evaluated and received a favorable \nprognosis from a duly qualified medical professional while participating in a treatment \nprogram or complying with aftercare requirements.  \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n6\nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \n \nAG \u00b6 15 explains the security concerns relating to personal conduct: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information.  \n \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. Two may be disqualifying in this case: \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \naward benefits or status, determine national security eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; and \n \n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information; or concealing or \nomitting information, concerning relevant facts to an employer, investigator, \nsecurity official, competent medical or mental health professional involved \nin making a recommendation relevant to a national security eligibility \ndetermination, or other official government representative. \n \nApplicant deliberately concealed information from the Government in his August \n2017 SCA and during his December 2017 interview about the extent of his illegal \nmarijuana use and the fact that he had tested positive for the drug on two occasions prior \nto his June 2017 drug-related suspension. The evidence establishes the above \ndisqualifying conditions and indicates that he intentionally omitted requested relevant \ninformation concerning his recent drug abuse. \n \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. Four may \npotentially apply: \n \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was caused \nor significantly contributed to by advice of legal counsel or of a person with \nprofessional responsibilities for advising or instructing the individual \nspecifically concerning security processes. Upon being made aware of the \nrequirement to cooperate or provide the information, the individual \ncooperated fully and truthfully; \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \n\n \n \n \n \n7\nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to \nrecur. \n \nApplicant presented insufficient evidence to establish mitigation under any of the \nabove conditions. He failed to be candid and forthright about his history of marijuana use \nwhen he completed his August 2017 SCA, during his December 2017 interview, and in \nresponse to interrogatories in June 2018. He did not disclose or acknowledge his \nmarijuana use problem until after the Government obtained his medical records \ndocumenting his history of marijuana abuse. He knew using marijuana was against \nfederal policy and his employer\u2019s rules, and admitted that during his interview. He held a \nsecurity clearance between 2015 and 2017, when he used marijuana and tested positive \nfor it. His intentional omission of requested information on three occasions is not a minor \noffense, and casts serious doubt on his judgment and trustworthiness. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s national security eligibility by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct \nand all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national security \neligibility must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the applicable guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuidelines H and E in this whole-person analysis.  \n \nApplicant is a mature man who honorably served in the Army for about 24 years. \nHe held a security clearance during that time. After leaving the Army in 2004, he began \n\n \n \n \n \n8\nworking for federal contractors and obtained an interim security clearance. He knew using \nmarijuana was illegal, and violated his employer\u2019s and the federal government\u2019s policies, \nespecially while holding a security clearance. His use of marijuana and attempts to \nconceal it during this investigative process raise serious questions about his reliability and \ntrustworthiness. He further agreed not to use alcohol or marijuana while under the care \nof his physician and taking prescribed medication, and breached that agreement. \nApplicant failed to demonstrate rehabilitation, significant behavioral changes, or mitigate \nthe security concerns raised. Overall, the evidence raises serious doubt as to Applicant\u2019s \npresent eligibility and suitability for a security clearance.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:           AGAINST APPLICANT \n \n                          Subparagraphs 1.a through 1.d: \n      Against Applicant \n \n     Subparagraph 1.e: \n \n \n      For Applicant \n \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:           AGAINST APPLICANT \n \n       Subparagraphs 2.a and 2.b:   \n     \n                               \n                 Against Applicant \n     Conclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant access to \nclassified information.

Applicant, a \nnaturalized U.S. citizen from Russia, failed to mitigate the security concerns raised by \nher ongoing contact with family members and friends who are citizens and residents of \nRussia. Clearance is denied.  \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn May 30, 2018, the DOD issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing \nsecurity concerns under the foreign influence guideline.1 DOD adjudicators were unable \nto find that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue \nApplicant\u2019s security clearance and recommended that the case be submitted to an \nadministrative judge for a determination whether to revoke or deny Applicant\u2019s security \nclearance.  \n1 The DOD acted under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry, \nsigned by President Eisenhower on February 20, 1960, as amended; as well as DOD Directive 5220.6, \nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program, dated January 2, 1992, as amended \n(Directive), and the Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information, \nimplemented on June 8, 2017.   \n\n \n2 \n \nApplicant timely answered the SOR and requested a hearing. At the hearing, \nconvened on November 28, 2018, I admitted Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 3, \nwithout objection.

Applicant\u2019s mother, 77, is a citizen of Russia, who has permanent resident status \nin the United States. She has lived with Applicant since 2009. She receives the majority \nof her financial support from Applicant, but also receives a small pension from the \nRussian government because of her 30 years\u2019 service as a teacher. Applicant believes \nthe pension is approximately $200 per month. Applicant has at least $560,000 in U.S.-\nbased assets including her home ($300,000) and retirement savings ($260,000). She \nearns $156,000 annually. Applicant does not own any Russia-based assets, but does \nmaintain some ties to Russia. She has traveled to Russia twice in the last ten years. Her \nlast trip occurred between December 2016 and January 2017, during which she visited \nher paternal half-sister who resides in Applicant\u2019s hometown as well as the city where \nher maternal half-sister resides. She also visited friends in the city where she attended \nhigh school and college.5  \n \nApplicant\u2019s paternal half-sister, 46, is a cosmetologist. They do not maintain \nfrequent contact, but communicate through a messaging application on their birthdays \nand holidays. Applicant visits her sister when she is in Russia. Applicant maintains \ncloser and more frequent contact with her maternal half-sister. At the time Applicant \ncompleted her security clearance application, her half-sister was working as a secretary \nfor a local government official, but she is currently unemployed. Applicant talks to this \nhalf-sister at least once per month. Applicant\u2019s half-sister and her 14-year-old daughter, \ncome the United States every year to visit Applicant, her mother, and her son. \nSometimes, Applicant pays for their trip and they stay in her home.6  \n \nWhen she completed the security clearance application, Applicant\u2019s maternal \nuncle was also a citizen and resident of Russia. He died in April 2018.7  \n \nIn addition to her family members, Applicant maintains contact with high school \nand college friends through two separate social media groups. After winning a national \nmath competition, Applicant was selected to attend an elite science and mathematics \nhigh school. She then earned admission into a prominent university where she studied \napplied mathematics and mechanics. Because of her education, she was not required \nto do compulsory military service. In her March 2017 subject interview, she identified 25 \nformer schoolmates with whom she maintains ongoing contact. During the interview, \n                                                          \n4 HE II. \n \n5 Tr. 16-19, 39, 41-43, 48; GE 1. \n \n6 Tr. 19-25; GE 1, 3.  \n \n7 Tr. 26; GE 1. \n\n \n4 \n \nshe was not able to supply details of her friends\u2019 residency or employment information. \nIn a September 2017 subject interview, she provided additional details about her foreign \ncontacts. At the hearing, she disclosed that she obtained employment information from \nthem after disclosing she needed the information for her security clearance application.8  \nOf those individuals she reported, 11 are residents and citizens of Russia. Four \nof the eleven work as executives in private industry, including the banking and beauty \nsectors. However, the nature of two of the companies Applicant disclosed are unclear \nfrom the record and are not readily determined by a simple internet search. Three of her \nclassmates work in STEM-related fields. One friend works as researcher for an \nunidentified geological company. Another friend is a computer programmer in private \nindustry. One friend is a professor at Applicant\u2019s alma mater. Applicant claims that none \nof her former classmates work for the Russian government or on government contracts. \nApplicant states that she infrequently posts writings in the groups. She maintains \noccasional contact with some of the group members outside the group on birthdays. \nShe may visit with these friends during her trips to Russia. She is willing to cease \nparticipation in both groups if required to maintain a security clearance.9  \nPolicies \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \n                                                          \n8 Tr. 33, 46-47; GE 2-3. \n \n9 Tr. 27-38, 43-46; GE 3; HE III. \n\n \n5 \n \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites  \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \n \nForeign Influence \n \n \n\u201c[F]oreign contacts and interests . . .are a national security concern . . . if they \ncreate circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or induced to help a \nforeign person in a way that is inconsistent with U.S. interest or otherwise made \nvulnerable to pressure and coercion by any foreign interest.\u201d An assessment of foreign \ncontacts and interests should consider the country in which the foreign interest is \nlocated, including but not limited to, consideration such as whether it is known target \nU.S. citizens to obtain classified or sensitive information or associated with a risk of \nterrorism.  \n \n \nIn this case, the concern is not just that Applicant\u2019s foreign relatives may be \nvulnerable to government coercion or inducement; there is also concern that Applicant\u2019s \ncontinued contacts with individuals, specifically former classmates, may make her \nvulnerable to exploitation. In the defense industry, foreign-born engineers and scientists \nplay a critical role in developing and implementing new technology, and that technology \nmay be of interest to others whose interests are contrary to the United States. Applicant \nworks in a STEM field and has several Russian contacts who are professionals in that \narena. U.S. intelligence has identified Russia as an active perpetrator of industrial \nespionage against the United States, often targeting individual\u2019s with ties to the country.  \nAccordingly, Applicant\u2019s relationships create a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, \ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion.10  Applicant\u2019s ongoing contacts with \nformer classmates from high school and college also create a potential conflict of \ninterest between the individual\u2019s obligation to protect classified or sensitive information \nor technology and the individual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by \nproviding that information.11  \n \n \nWhile her Russian family members may not hold positions or participate in \nactivities that create a risk a potential security risk; the same cannot be said of \nApplicant\u2019s social contacts. While her familial and social contacts may be infrequent, \n                                                          \n10 AG \u00b6 7(a). \n \n11 AG \u00b6 7(b). \n\n \n6 \n \nthey are not casual. Although Applicant demonstrated significant ties to the United \nStates, her ongoing ties with residents of citizens and residents of Russia are too \nextensive to support a finding that Applicant would resolve any conflicts of information in \nfavor of U.S interests. None of the foreign influence mitigating conditions apply. \n \nBased on the record, doubts remain about Applicant having access to classified \ninformation. In reaching this decision I have considered the whole-person factor detailed \nin AG \u00b6 2(d). Under the \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard, an \napplicant has a heavy burden of demonstrating extenuation or mitigation of facts with \nnegative security significance. Because she failed to meet this burden, the foreign \ninfluence concerns raised in the SOR must be resolved in favor of the national \nsecurity.12 \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Foreign Influence \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a, 1.c: \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.b, 1.d, 1.e: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented, it is not clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant Applicant a security clearance. Eligibility for access to \nclassified information is denied.   \n                                               \n \n \n \n________________________ \nNichole L.

As a result of a 2017 \npsychological evaluation ordered by the DOD Consolidated Adjudications Facility \n(CAF), a licensed clinical psychologist diagnosed Applicant with alcohol use disorder, \nstimulant use disorder, and delusional disorder in addition to identifying psychological \ncharacteristics that make Applicant a security risk. An independent evaluation procured \nby Applicant also resulted in a negative assessment of Applicant\u2019s ongoing security \nworthiness. Clearance is denied.  \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn April 30, 2018, the DOD issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing \nsecurity concerns under the psychological conditions, personal conduct, alcohol \nconsumption, and drug involvement and substance misuse guidelines.1 DOD \nadjudicators were unable to find that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to \n                                                          \n1 The DOD acted under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry, \nsigned by President Eisenhower on February 20, 1960, as amended; as well as DOD Directive 5220.6, \nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program, dated January 2, 1992, as amended \n(Directive), and the Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information, \nimplemented on June 8, 2017.   \n \n\n \n2 \n \ngrant Applicant\u2019s security clearance and recommended that the case be submitted to a \nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) administrative judge for a \ndetermination whether to revoke his security clearance.  \n \nApplicant timely answered the SOR and requested a hearing. At the hearing, \nconvened on November 29, 2018, I admitted Government\u2019s Exhibits (GE) 1 through 7, \nand Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AE) A through K, without objection. After the hearing, the \nGovernment submitted curriculum vitae (CV) for the psychologist who completed \nApplicant\u2019s 2017 psychological evaluation. (GE 5.) The Applicant timely submitted AE L \nthrough O, which are also admitted without objection. (AE M.) DOHA received the \ntranscript (Tr.) on December 7, 2018.   \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant, 51, has worked for his employer, a federal contracting company, since \n2008. He served in the Army from July 1985 to July 1989, and again from October 1990 \nto July 1992. He received honorable discharges for both enlistments. Applicant has held \na security clearance at various times since 1985. The SOR arises from an August 2013 \nincident report that Applicant\u2019s employer filed in the Joint Personnel Adjudication \nSystem (JPAS) raising concerns Applicant\u2019s mental health. (Tr. 20-23, 30-33; GE 4.)  \n \nThe August 2013 Security Report \n \nBetween September 2012 and May 2013, Applicant worked on what he \ndescribed as a \u201cspecial access program (SAP) in a high security location\u201d in State 1. In \nlate 2012, he reported possible elicitation attempts to his supervisor. Unsatisfied with \nhow his former supervisor handled his concerns, Applicant filed a formal report \nregarding the attempted elicitation with his employer\u2019s security department in August \n2013. (Tr. 20-23, 30-33; GE 4.) \n \n According to a memorandum prepared by Applicant\u2019s employer, dated August \n15, 2013, Applicant reported possible elicitation attempts he experienced while he was \nliving and working in State 1. Although Applicant did not believe the facility in State 1 \nwas in danger, he believed that he was being targeted  by unidentified people. During \nthe nine months he worked in State 1, he believed unidentified individuals were \nattempting to collect his personal information electronically and by burglarizing and \nbugging his home. He reported problems with his neighbors, including their inexplicable \nknowledge of details about his personal and professional life. He claimed that his \nneighbors repeatedly accused him of sex crimes and that he believed the police \nfollowed him. When he moved to State 2 in June 2013, he believed that his neighbors \nalready knew his name and some information about him. Applicant also reported \ndifficulty sleeping and people trying to \u201cbreak him down.\u201d (GE 4.) \n \n \nBecause of Applicant\u2019s report, the security office filed an incident report in JPAS \non August 21, 2013 indicating that Applicant was exhibiting paranoid behavior. The \nreport noted that Applicant did not present a heightened risk of disruptive or violent \nbehavior. On August 22, 2013, Applicant met with two members of human resources \n\n \n3 \n \nand a security manager. The company representatives gave Applicant a mandatory \nreferral to the Employee Assistance Program (EAP). In a memorandum memorializing \nthat meeting, Applicant\u2019s employer notes the conclusions from the EAP referral, which \nindicated that Applicant was not a risk to himself or others. The memorandum also \nnoted that Applicant complied with the employer\u2019s requirements and the referral was \nclosed. Since August 2013, Applicant\u2019s employer has not filed any other incident reports \nconcerning Applicant exhibiting paranoid behavior or expressing paranoid beliefs at \nwork. In 2017, Applicant received a monetary performance award and in 2018, his \nemployer recognized him for ten years of service. (GE 3-4, AE D-E.)  \n \nThe 2017 Psychological Evaluation \n \nIn December 2017, four years after the JPAS incident report, Applicant submitted \nto a psychological evaluation as requested by the DOD CAF. A licensed clinical \npsychologist contracted by DOD CAF performed the evaluation. In developing the \nconclusions presented in the 2017 evaluation report, the psychologist relied on a review \nof DOD Manual 5200.02, a clinical interview with Applicant, and the review of \nunspecified documents. Applicant also completed a personality assessment inventory \n(PAI). However, the psychologist was unable to interpret the results because Applicant \nanswered the questions in a manner suggesting that he was trying to present himself in \nan uncharacteristically positive way. The LCP summarized her findings in the 2017 \nevaluation report:  \n \n[Applicant] has a history of stimulant abuse (cocaine, methamphetamine) \nand paranoid ideation that may be related to one another. This subject \nfailed to disclose and sometimes denied documented problems with \nparanoia, mental health treatment, and substance abuse when asked \ndirectly about relevant questions. However, when confronted with this \ninformation, he acknowledged his history and gave elaborate explanations \nabout both his problems and his failure to disclose them. It is not clear that \n[Applicant] continues to abuse stimulants or have floridly psychotic \nparanoid beliefs, but there is cause for concern in continuing beliefs that \nhe is being monitored by the government and in his obtaining stimulants \nfor the treatment of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) \nrelatively late in life, after years of abuse of illegal stimulants. [Applicant\u2019s] \nrecurrent substance abuse, paranoid ideation, and engagement in \ndeception are each psychological conditions that are sufficient on their \nown to impair his judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness, with their joint \noccurrence increasing the level of risk associated with granting [Applicant] \na security clearance. (GE 5.) \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \nThe LCP diagnosed three psychological disorders as adversely affecting \nApplicant\u2019s ongoing security worthiness: \n \nDiagnosis 1: History of Alcohol Use Disorder, severity and remission status \nunknown  \n \n \nThe LCP based this diagnosis on treatment between October 2004 and January \n2005 for substance and alcohol abuse. The report does not delve further into the issue \nand contains no information regarding Applicant\u2019s alcohol consumption habits in the \npast or at the time of the evaluation.  \n \nAt the hearing, Applicant testified that he consumes alcohol occasionally and \nnever to the point of intoxication. His only documented incident of alcohol-related \nmisconduct is a 1999 charge for having an open container of alcohol in public. (GE 5.) \n \nDiagnosis 2: Stimulant Use Disorder, severity and remission status \nunknown \nThe psychologist notes that in the clinical interview, Applicant described his \nhistory of drug abuse in general terms. He admitted using marijuana in high school, \ncocaine occasionally in the 1990s, and amphetamines on two occasions to help him \nstay awake during shift work. Citing an unspecified medical record, the psychologist \ndetermined that Applicant used cocaine and methamphetamine until 1997. The \npsychologist does not report the date Applicant began using illegal drugs or the \nfrequency of use. In a June 2010 subject interview from a previous security clearance \ninvestigation, Applicant admitted that he began using methamphetamine daily in 2004, \nand that he voluntarily participated in an outpatient substance abuse treatment between \nOctober 2004 and January 2005. The psychologist also noted that in an unspecified \nsecurity clearance application, Applicant described his methamphetamine use as \nexperimental without indicating the frequency of use. The psychologist quotes an \nunidentified source indicating that Applicant had a relapse while being treated by a \nphysician from the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), but does specify when the \nrelapse occurred. The psychologist also mentions that Applicant received a guarded \nprognosis regarding his future use of illegal drugs, but does not specify who offered the \nprognosis or when it was given. (GE 5.) \n \nThe hearing record contains additional and conflicting statements from Applicant \nregarding his history of substance abuse. In an October 2013 security clearance \napplication, Applicant reported that he received substance abuse treatment, but \nreported that he only experimented with methamphetamines on two occasions. It is \nunclear if the psychologist reviewed the October 2013 security clearance application. At \nhearing, Applicant testified that he took a leave of absence from work to address his \nsubstance abuse issues. He described his use of illegal drugs as not being serious \nenough to warrant inpatient treatment.  Applicant further testified that he did not have a \nsecurity clearance at the time he used illegal drugs and sought treatment. Since \ncompleting treatment in 2005, he denies use of any illegal substance. (GE 5.)  \n\n \n5 \n \nIn the evaluation, the psychologist discussed Applicant\u2019s diagnosis for ADHD, \nexpressing concern that Applicant received an ADHD diagnosis in his forties given that \nthe disorder usually has childhood onset and is usually diagnosed and treated before \nmidlife. However, the psychologist did not perform testing to confirm or refute the \ndiagnosis. The psychologist\u2019s doubt about the appropriateness of the ADHD diagnosis \ngiven Applicant\u2019s history of methamphetamine abuse weighs heavily in her overall \nassessment of Applicant\u2019s mental health and ongoing security worthiness. (GE 5.)  \n \nThe psychologist opined that the paranoid ideation that Applicant experienced \nresulted in the August 2013 security report could be an indication of amphetamine \nabuse, citing the low probability of an individual experiencing paranoid ideation when \ntaking amphetamines prescribed at therapeutic levels. However, the 2017 evaluation \ndoes not discuss Applicant\u2019s ADHD treatment history or medication dosages, nor does \nthe evaluation note that the psychologist reviewed any medical records relevant to the \nissue. (GE 5.) \n \nAccording to the hearing record, Applicant was diagnosed with ADHD in late \n2011 or early 2012. Medical records produced by the Government indicate that \nApplicant\u2019s physician confirmed the diagnosis in March 2014 after conducting a formal \nbattery of tests. Applicant began taking prescribed amphetamines in March 2012. His \nphysician monitored and adjusted the dosage of amphetamines as needed. When \nApplicant moved to State 1 in September 2012, he engaged a psychiatrist to monitor his \nmedication. Between October 2012 and June 2013, that psychiatrist prescribed an \namphetamine medication at a dosage of 30 milligrams (mg) above the drug \nmanufacturer\u2019s recommended daily maximum dosage. According to the manufacturer, \nparanoid ideation is a side effect of the particular amphetamine prescribed. This nine-\nmonth period precedes Applicant\u2019s August 2013 security report. When Applicant moved \nto State 2 in July 2013, he resumed treatment with the psychiatrist who treated him in \nthe months before his move to State 1. Over the next six months, the psychiatrist \nreduced the amphetamine dosage to a level 30mg below the manufacturer\u2019s \nrecommend daily maximum dosage. Since the August 2013 security report, Applicant\u2019s \nemployer has made no other reports of paranoid ideation or behaviors. (Tr. 49; GE 7; \nAE I.)  \n \nThe hearing record also includes treatment notes from March 2014 to June 2015. \nDuring that 18-month period, Applicant had six routine visits with his primary care \nphysician. During each visit, the doctor assessed Applicant\u2019s mental state and mood as \nappropriate. The records do not contain any concerns about paranoid ideation or any \nother concerns about Applicant\u2019s mental health. The records also do not raise any \nconcerns about Applicant misusing his ADHD medication or engaging in drug-seeking \nbehavior. In November 2014, Applicant began taking Adderall as prescribed without any \nnoted impact on his mood. Applicant also provided treatment notes from a July 2018 \ndoctor visit. He informed the doctor about the concerns raised in the 2017 evaluation \nabout his use of stimulant medication. In response, the doctor indicated that he would \nreview Applicant\u2019s formal testing and make any changes deemed necessary. Applicant \ndenies any use of illegal substances since he completed the substance abuse treatment \nprogram in 2005. He also denies taking his ADHD medication in a manner other than \n\n \n6 \n \nprescribed. The record does not contain any instances work place or criminal \nmisconduct related to substance abuse. (GE 7; AE G.)  \n \nDiagnosis 3: Delusional Disorder, persecutory type, severity and remission \nstatus unknown \n \n \nDuring the evaluation, Applicant denied ever having being treated for any other \nmental health problem aside from ADHD. He denied experiencing any past paranoid \nideation. Applicant also denied the mandatory EAP referral issued by his employer was \nin response to his August 2013 security report. The psychologist noted that when \nApplicant was confronted about his August 2013 security report and statements he \nmade to his physician about the ADHD medication making him feel paranoid, Applicant \ncontinued to offer either explanations that were contrary to the evidence or explanations \nthat minimized the seriousness of the reported issues. (GE 5.) \n \n \nBased on the available information, the psychologist determined there was not \nenough information to support a delusional disorder diagnosis. However, the \npsychologist expressed concerns that Applicant\u2019s paranoid ideation was not completely \nresolved based on the paranoid behavior he exhibited during the evaluation. The \nbehaviors what the psychologist classified as \u201cnot unreasonable, but uncommon\u201d \nincluded, asking the psychologist to produce identification after being asked to produce \nhis own, and expressing relief when informed that the PAI would be completed on an \nencrypted virtual private network (VPN). The psychologist also citied, as evidence of \nApplicant\u2019s ongoing paranoid ideation, his statements about government agencies \nmonitoring digital communications and his belief that his status as an employee of a \nfederal contracting company increased the likelihood that he was being monitored. The \nmonitoring, the psychologist noted, did not bother Applicant who explained that he \nviewed the government employees who monitor others for security risks as \u201cjust doing \ntheir jobs.\u201d Applicant explained to the psychologist that he worked on the development \nof such a monitoring program. (GE 5.) \n \n \nAdditional Psychological Concerns  \n \nIn addition to the three diagnoses described above, the psychologist also cited \nthe following as \u201cpsychological characteristics interfering with Applicant\u2019s judgment, \nreliability, trustworthiness:\u201d \n \n[Applicant] was not honest and forthcoming about his substance use \nhistory or mental health history with this examiner. Again, although \n[Applicant\u2019s] deceptiveness and guardedness make it difficult to assess \nthe current severity of his symptoms and whether they occur \nindependently of or only as a result of stimulant abuse, his deceptiveness \nin itself is a psychological characteristic that clearly intervenes with his \njudgment, reliability, and trustworthiness.  \n \nThe psychologist rated Applicant\u2019s prognosis as poor. (GE 5.) \n \n\n \n7 \n \n 2018 Psychological Evaluation  \n \n \nApplicant procured a second psychological evaluation after the hearing. The \nevaluation was completed by a three-person evaluation team, including a board certified \npsychologist, a post-doctoral resident in clinical psychology, and a clinical psychology \nintern. The evaluation process included a personality assessment inventory, a clinical \ninterview involving all the members of the evaluation team, and a review of the 2017 \nevaluation report. The evaluation team considered the purpose of the evaluation to \nprovide an \u201cunbiased, third-party assessment in order to provide a second opinion on \nthis matter.\u201d (AE M.) \n \nWhile the PAI scores produced a valid clinical profile, the evaluation team did not \ninterpret the results. Despite being warned against doing so, the evaluation team \ndetermined that Applicant\u2019s approach to the PAI showed an attempted \u201cmanipulation of \ntest items.\u201d As a result, the evaluation team concluded that Applicant was \u201clikely evasive \nand unwilling to admit to many personal faults.\u201d The evaluation team observed that, \n\u201c[i]ndividuals with similar profiles are often uninterested and unwilling to discuss their \nproblems.\u201d During the evaluation, Applicant provided statements and explanations \ninconsistent with those he provided during the 2017 evaluation on several topics, \nincluding: his history of mental health treatment, his history of illegal drug use, and the \npurpose of the 2013 EAP evaluation. Given the limited record review and the evaluation \nteam\u2019s finding that Applicant was an unreliable historian, the evaluation team did not \nbelieve they had enough information to make any formal or specific diagnoses. \nHowever, they reached the following conclusion: \n \nThis evaluation seems to be consistent with [the 2017 evaluation]. \n[Applicant] is consistently evasive and deceptive in his interview \nresponses as well as personality test results.  \n \nUnless he is confronted with evidence, [Applicant] appears to deny or \nminimize any issues that may warrant serious attention. This is a \nsignificant integrity, reliability, and trustworthiness deficit \u2026 \n \nIt is unknown at this time, due to a lack of credible information if \n[Applicant] is suffering from any mental disorders, however it is \nrecommended that he seek counseling for his current stressors. \n \nFrom a psychological perspective and as a result of extensive \npsychological testing and  evaluation, it is felt that he is not recommended \nfor a position impacting national security or involving public trust at this \ntime. He should be reevaluated. (AE M.) \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n8 \n \n2019 Comprehensive Assessment \n \n \nIn January 2019, Applicant submitted to a \u201ccompressive assessment\u201d performed \nby a licensed clinical professional counselor (LCPC). The letter provided by the LCPC \nstates, in its entirety: \n \nI met with and conducted a Comprehensive Assessment of [Applicant] \non 15 January 2019. [Applicant] was open and forthcoming with all of the \ninformation that I asked of him. In my opinion, he is trustworthy and \ncompetent to hold a U.S. Government Security Clearance. (AE O.) \n \nThe note does not indicate what type of evaluation protocol was used or the sources of \ninformation used to reach the stated conclusion. In his post-hearing submission, \nApplicant indicated that he intended to continue \u201congoing therapeutic counseling and \nmedication management from a duly qualified mental health professional for my adult \nADHD symptoms.\u201d (AE L.) \n \nAt the hearing, Applicant appeared appropriately dressed and his mood and \ndisposition were appropriate for the setting. Applicant admitted that he is very security \nconscious. He stays current on all of his security training and routinely reads the \nsecurity pamphlets published by his employer. He is mindful of his surroundings and is \ncareful not to discuss his work in public to avoid unwittingly compromising his \nemployer\u2019s or the government\u2019s interests. (Tr. 28-29.)  \n \nPolicies \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record.  \n \n\n \n9 \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s August 2013 security report raised concerns about his mental health \nand resulted in the DOD CAF requesting a psychological evaluation to determine \nApplicant\u2019s continued ability to properly handle and safeguard classified information. \nThe evaluation, completed by a licensed clinical psychologist in December 2017, raised \na number of concerns that negatively affect Applicant\u2019s ongoing security worthiness.  \n \n \nBased on the results of the December 2017 evaluation, the SOR alleges \ndisqualifying conduct under the psychological conditions, drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, alcohol consumption, and personal conduct guidelines. The \npsychologist diagnosed three disorders: alcohol use disorder, stimulant abuse disorder, \nand delusional disorder. The psychologist qualified each diagnosis as \u201cseverity and \nremission status unknown.\u201d In addition, the psychologist identified behaviors Applicant \nexhibited during the evaluation that may suggest a problem with paranoid behavior. \nHowever, the most significant finding relating to Applicant\u2019s ongoing security worthiness \nis the psychologist\u2019s negative credibility assessment. The psychologist concluded that \nApplicant was an unreliable and incredible source of information. Applicant\u2019s \ninconsistent and contradictory disclosures and his attempts to present himself in an \nuncharacteristically favorable light prevented the psychologist from making a more \ndefinitive assessment. \n \n \nHowever, it is worth noting that the 2017 evaluation is not without its flaws. The \nreport does not identify the records reviewed in reaching the conclusions presented. \nThe report alludes to, but does not detail, a more extensive history of mental health \nissues as well as a more extensive history of substance abuse than reported by \n\n \n10 \n \nApplicant or contained in the hearing record.  Accordingly, it is unclear how many times, \nand under what circumstances Applicant received mental health or substance abuse \ntreatment in the past.  \n \n \nThe 2017 evaluation is also problematic in the way it treats Applicant\u2019s adult \nADHD diagnosis and treatment. The psychologist expressed doubt about the diagnosis \nwithout performing testing to confirm or refute it. Because of her doubts about the \nappropriateness of the diagnosis and her negative assumptions as to why Applicant \nsought treatment, she did not consider the connection between Applicant\u2019s past history \nof substance abuse and his untreated ADHD symptoms. The psychologist did not \nexamine or discuss the relationship of these factors in reaching her conclusion about \nApplicant\u2019s prognosis for future substance abuse.  \n \n \nAlthough the psychologist raised legitimate concerns about the potential dangers \nof amphetamine abuse given Applicant\u2019s history and the possible impact of long time \namphetamine use on Applicant\u2019s mental health, these concerns are rooted in the \nassumption that Applicant is abusing his legally prescribed amphetamine medication. \nThey psychologist does not cite any contemporaneous event on which to base this \nassumption, only that she does not believe Applicant\u2019s statements that he takes his \nADHD medication as prescribed.  The psychologist also dismisses the possibility that \nthe paranoid ideation Applicant experienced resulting in the August 2013 security \nreport, was temporary and caused by possible overmedication by his treating \npsychiatrist. It is unclear if the psychologist reviewed any medical records from \nApplicant\u2019s treating psychiatrist or if the psychologist reviewed relevant documents and \ndecided to given them little to no weight. The record does not contain any information to \nsupport concerns about amphetamine abuse. The available medical records do not \ncontain any evidence to indicate Applicant has engaged in drug-seeking behavior or \nthat Applicant is engaged in prescription drug abuse. Nor do any of the medical records \nindicate problems with ongoing paranoid ideation or behavior. \n \n \nBecause the psychologist did not view Applicant in a favorable light, she \nconsidered his overall behavior and demeanor problematic. The psychologist elevated \nbehaviors she described as \u201cunusual, but not unreasonable,\u201d as being evidence of \npotentially unresolved paranoid behavior. Because of Applicant\u2019s lack of credibility, the \npsychologist determined that the only way to justify Applicant\u2019s behavior was to \u201cchoose \nbetween a susceptibility to paranoid delusions, paranoia induced by amphetamine or \nmethamphetamine abuse, or both. The psychologist did not consider any benign \nmotivations for Applicant\u2019s behavior and statements.  \n \n \nOf particular concern to the psychologist were Applicant\u2019s statements about \ngovernment monitoring of his electronic communications.  In evaluating the significance \nof these statements, context is key. In the psychological evaluation, Applicant exhibited \nan indifferent attitude toward the occasional and passive government monitoring of his \ndigital communications2 as opposed to the active, targeted, and malicious intentions of \n                                                          \n2 Applicant\u2019s statements regarding government monitoring of electronic communications are not incorrect.  \nGovernment information systems are routinely monitored, and warnings about such monitoring are \ndisplayed each time a user logs on to government information system. Also, government monitoring of \n\n11 \n \nunknown actors he reported in the August 2013 report. Aside from noting the behaviors, \nthe psychologist does not indicate that Applicant\u2019s concerns caused him to refuse to \nparticipate or cooperate in the evaluation protocol. Applicant is extraordinarily security \nconscious. He is hyper-vigilant about his environment and security practices. His \nbehavior and statements during the interview are in line with these personality traits. \nThe security concerns raised by these behaviors are resolved in Applicant\u2019s favor.  \n \n \n Despite the flaws in the evaluation report, the psychologist identified a security \nconcern not previously raised in prior adjudications of Applicant\u2019s security clearance. \nThe psychologist determined that Applicant possessed psychological characteristics \nthat may impair his judgment, stability, reliability, or trustworthiness.  Specifically, his \ndeceptiveness and failure to provide full, frank, and candid disclosures regarding \nadverse information until confronted with evidence. The psychologist rated Applicant\u2019s \nprognosis as poor. The observations regarding Applicant\u2019s lack of credibility, \nevasiveness, deceptiveness and the adverse effect on Applicant\u2019s continued security \nworthiness, were corroborated by the team of duly-qualified mental health professionals \nApplicant retained in December 2018 for an independent psychological evaluation.  \n  \n \nThe record supports a finding that following disqualifying conditions apply: \n \n\uf0b7 Psychological Conditions Disqualifying Condition 28(b): an \nopinion by a duly qualified mental health professional that the \nindividual has a condition that may impair judgment, stability, \nreliability, or trustworthiness;  \n \n \n\uf0b7 Personal Conduct Disqualifying Condition 16(b): deliberately \nproviding false or misleading information; or concealing or omitting \ninformation, concerning relevant facts to an \u2026mental health \nprofessional involved in making a recommendation relevant to \nnational security eligibility determination\u2026; \n\uf0b7 Alcohol Consumption Disqualifying Condition 22(d): \n \ndiagnosis \nby a duly qualified medical or mental health professional of alcohol \nuse disorder; and  \n \n\uf0b7 Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse Disqualifying \nCondition 25(d): diagnosis by a duly qualified medical or mental \nhealth professional of substance use disorder. \n \nWhile the record does not contain any recent adverse reports from law enforcement or \nhis employer indicating that Applicant has current problems with substance abuse, or \ndelusional or paranoid behaviors, there is insufficient evidence in the record to mitigate \nthe security concerns raised by the 2017 and 2018 evaluation reports.  \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                           \nthe electronic communications of private citizens has long been the subject of law suit filed by civil rights \norganizations. See, e.g., https://www.aclu.org/issues/national-security/privacy-and-surveillance. \n \n\n \n12 \n \n \nThe Applicant offers two potential sources of mitigation: his statements regarding \nhis current alcohol consumption habits, his compliance with his ADHD treatment plan, \nand his assessment of his overall mental health; and, the January 2019 comprehensive \nassessment from a LCPC. Because Applicant has provided inconsistent statements \nabout his substance abuse history and mental health treatment history, as well as his \npropensity to present himself in an uncharacteristically favorable manner, his testimony \ncarries little weight. Applicant\u2019s statements that he will receive ongoing therapeutic \ncounseling from an LCPC also fail to mitigate the alleged security concerns. Applicant \ndid not present any information regarding the nature and scope of the therapeutic \ncounseling, nor has Applicant demonstrated that he acknowledges or understands the \nconcerns raised in the 2017 and 2018 evaluations. The January 2019 compressive \nassessment, indicating that Applicant is trustworthy and competent to hold a security \nclearance, is also insufficient evidence of mitigation. The assessment does not provide \nany basis for this conclusion or any explanation to refute the conclusions in the 2017 \nand 2018 evaluations. Nor does it provide a favorable prognosis for any of the identified \nissues. According none of the mitigating conditions available under the alleged \nguidelines apply.  \n \nWhole Person Assessment \n \n \nApplicant is a long-time clearance holder. He takes his responsibilities to adhere \nto security produces and regulations very seriously. He is always cognizant of and \nvigilant in his surroundings. Despite this favorable information, doubts remain about his \nongoing security worthiness. In reaching this conclusion, I have also considered the \nwhole-person factors at AG \u00b6 2(d). The purpose of the security clearance adjudication is \nto make \u201can examination of a sufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make an affirmative \ndetermination that the person is an acceptable security risk.\u201d (AG \u00b6 2(d).) The 2017 and \n2018 psychological evaluations independently reached conclusions supporting a \nnegative-whole person assessment. Applicant\u2019s inability to acknowledge or deal with his \nproblems raises concerns about his judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness that make \nhis continued access to classified information an unacceptable security risk. As the \nAugust 2013 security report shows, Applicant will report any perceived security threat in \nhis external environment. However, the evaluations raises concerns that he will not \nacknowledge, admit, or report potential security issues raised by his own behavior \npreventing the government from fully assessing Applicant\u2019s security worthiness.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Psychological Conditions  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.c, 1.e: \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \n \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n\n \n13 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFormal Findings (Continued) \nParagraph 2, Personal Conduct  \nAGAINST APPPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a:   \n \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 3, Alcohol Consumption \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 3.a:  \n \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 4, Drug Involvement and  \nSubstance Misuse  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 4.a:  \n \n \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented, it is not clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant Applicant a security clearance.

As a result of a 2017 \npsychological evaluation ordered by the DOD Consolidated Adjudications Facility \n(CAF), a licensed clinical psychologist diagnosed Applicant with alcohol use disorder, \nstimulant use disorder, and delusional disorder in addition to identifying psychological \ncharacteristics that make Applicant a security risk. An independent evaluation procured \nby Applicant also resulted in a negative assessment of Applicant\u2019s ongoing security \nworthiness. Clearance is denied.  \nStatement of the Case \nOn April 30, 2018, the DOD issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing \nsecurity concerns under the psychological conditions, personal conduct, alcohol \nconsumption, and drug involvement and substance misuse guidelines. This action was \ntaken under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry, signed by President Eisenhower on February 20, 1960, as amended; as well \nas DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram, dated January 2, 1992, as amended (Directive), and the Adjudicative \nGuidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information, implemented \non June 8, 2017.  DOD adjudicators were unable to find that it is clearly consistent with \n\n \n2 \n \nthe national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s security clearance and recommended that the \ncase be submitted to a Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) administrative \njudge for a determination whether to revoke his security clearance.  \n \nApplicant timely answered the SOR and requested a hearing. At the hearing, \nconvened on November 29, 2018, I admitted Government\u2019s Exhibits (GE) 1 through 7, \nand Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AE) A through K, without objection. After the hearing, the \nGovernment submitted curriculum vitae (CV) for the psychologist who completed \nApplicant\u2019s 2017 psychological evaluation. (GE 5.) The Applicant timely submitted AE L \nthrough O, which are also admitted without objection. (AE M.) DOHA received the \ntranscript (Tr.) on December 7, 2018.   \n \nOn April 30, 2019, I issued a Decision revoking Applicant\u2019s continued access to \nclassified information. Applicant appealed the Decision and on August 13, 2019, the \nAppeal Board remanded the Decision, determining that Applicant made a prima facie \nshowing that documents may be missing from the record. The Appeal Board ordered \nthat I review the record to determine if any documents were missing from the record and \nif so, collect them, consider them, and issue a new decision consistent with the \nDirective.  \n \n \nA review of the hearing record and the post-hearing submissions revealed that \nfour character letters submitted by the Applicant on December 22, 2018 were \ninadvertently excluded from the record. Department Counsel reviewed the letters and \ndid not object to their admission to the record as AE P through S. The correspondence \nrelated to the Remand Order are appended to the record as Appellate Exhibit (APP. \nEX.) I. The final exhibit list, certified as complete and accurate by the parties, is \nappended to the hearing record as APP. EX. II.  \n \n \nIn accordance with the Remand Order, I have reviewed and considered the \ncontents of the complete evidentiary record, and have clarified my findings of fact and \nwhole-person analysis as appropriate.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant, 51, has worked for his employer, a federal contracting company, since \n2008. He served in the Army from July 1985 to July 1989, and again from October 1990 \nto July 1992. Applicant earned several decorations, medals, badges, and service \nribbons. He received honorable discharges for both enlistments. Applicant has held a \nsecurity clearance at various times since 1985. The SOR arises from an August 2013 \nincident report that Applicant\u2019s employer filed in the Joint Personnel Adjudication \nSystem (JPAS) raising concerns about Applicant\u2019s mental health. (Tr. 20-23, 30-33; GE \n4; AE B.)  \n \nThe August 2013 Security Report \n \nBetween September 2012 and May 2013, Applicant worked on what he \ndescribed as a \u201cspecial access program (SAP) in a high security location\u201d in State 1. In \n\n \n3 \n \nlate 2012, he reported possible elicitation attempts to his supervisor. Unsatisfied with \nhow his former supervisor handled his concerns, Applicant filed a formal report \nregarding the attempted elicitation with his employer\u2019s security department in August \n2013. (Tr. 20-23, 30-33; GE 4.) \n \n According to a memorandum prepared by Applicant\u2019s employer, dated August \n15, 2013, Applicant reported possible elicitation attempts he experienced while he was \nliving and working in State 1. Although Applicant did not believe the facility in State 1 \nwas in danger, he believed that he was being targeted  by unidentified people. During \nthe nine months he worked in State 1, he believed unidentified individuals were \nattempting to collect his personal information electronically and by burglarizing and \nbugging his home. He reported problems with his neighbors, including their inexplicable \nknowledge of details about his personal and professional life. He claimed that his \nneighbors repeatedly accused him of sex crimes and that he believed the police \nfollowed him. When he moved to State 2 in June 2013, he believed that his neighbors \nalready knew his name and some information about him. Applicant also reported \ndifficulty sleeping and people trying to \u201cbreak him down.\u201d (GE 4.) \n \n \nBecause of Applicant\u2019s report, the security office filed an incident report in JPAS \non August 21, 2013, indicating that Applicant was exhibiting paranoid behavior. The \nreport noted that Applicant did not present a heightened risk of disruptive or violent \nbehavior. On August 22, 2013, Applicant met with two members of human resources \nand a security manager. The company representatives gave Applicant a mandatory \nreferral to the Employee Assistance Program (EAP). In a memorandum memorializing \nthat meeting, Applicant\u2019s employer noted the conclusions from the EAP referral, which \nindicated that Applicant was not a risk to himself or others. The memorandum also \nnoted that Applicant complied with the employer\u2019s requirements and the referral was \nclosed. Since August 2013, Applicant\u2019s employer has not filed any other incident reports \nconcerning Applicant exhibiting paranoid behavior or expressing paranoid beliefs at \nwork. In 2017, Applicant received a monetary performance award and in 2018, his \nemployer recognized him for ten years of service. (GE 3-4, AE D-E.)  \n \nThe 2017 Psychological Evaluation \n \nIn December 2017, four years after the JPAS incident report, Applicant submitted \nto a psychological evaluation as requested by the DOD CAF. A licensed clinical \npsychologist (LCP) contracted by DOD CAF performed the evaluation. In developing the \nconclusions presented in the 2017 evaluation report, the psychologist relied on a review \nof DOD Manual 5200.02, a clinical interview with Applicant, and the review of \nunspecified documents. Applicant also completed a personality assessment inventory \n(PAI). However, the psychologist was unable to interpret the results because Applicant \nanswered the questions in a manner suggesting that he was trying to present himself in \nan uncharacteristically positive way. The LCP summarized her findings in the 2017 \nevaluation report:  \n \n[Applicant] has a history of stimulant abuse (cocaine, methamphetamine) \nand paranoid ideation that may be related to one another. This subject \n\n \n4 \n \nfailed to disclose and sometimes denied documented problems with \nparanoia, mental health treatment, and substance abuse when asked \ndirectly about relevant questions. However, when confronted with this \ninformation, he acknowledged his history and gave elaborate explanations \nabout both his problems and his failure to disclose them. It is not clear that \n[Applicant] continues to abuse stimulants or have floridly psychotic \nparanoid beliefs, but there is cause for concern in continuing beliefs that \nhe is being monitored by the government and in his obtaining stimulants \nfor the treatment of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) \nrelatively late in life, after years of abuse of illegal stimulants. [Applicant\u2019s] \nrecurrent substance abuse, paranoid ideation, and engagement in \ndeception are each psychological conditions that are sufficient on their \nown to impair his judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness, with their joint \noccurrence increasing the level of risk associated with granting [Applicant] \na security clearance. (GE 5.) \n \n \nThe LCP diagnosed three psychological disorders as adversely affecting \nApplicant\u2019s ongoing security worthiness: \n \nDiagnosis 1: History of Alcohol Use Disorder, severity and remission status \nunknown  \n \nThe LCP based this diagnosis on treatment between October 2004 and January \n2005 for substance and alcohol abuse. The report does not delve further into the issue \nand contains no information regarding Applicant\u2019s alcohol consumption habits in the \npast or at the time of the evaluation.  \n \nAt the hearing, Applicant testified that he consumes alcohol occasionally and \nnever to the point of intoxication. His only documented incident of alcohol-related \nmisconduct is a 1999 charge for having an open container of alcohol in public. (GE 5.) \n \nDiagnosis 2: Stimulant Use Disorder, severity and remission status \nunknown \n \nThe LCP noted that in the clinical interview, Applicant described his history of \ndrug abuse in general terms. He admitted using marijuana in high school, cocaine \noccasionally in the 1990s, and amphetamines on two occasions to help him stay awake \nduring shift work. Citing an unspecified medical record, the psychologist determined that \nApplicant used cocaine and methamphetamine until 1997. The psychologist does not \nreport the date Applicant began using illegal drugs or the frequency of use. In a June \n2010 subject interview from a previous security clearance investigation, Applicant \nadmitted that he began using methamphetamine daily in 2004, and that he voluntarily \nparticipated in an outpatient substance abuse treatment between October 2004 and \nJanuary 2005. The psychologist also noted that in an unspecified security clearance \napplication, Applicant described his methamphetamine use as experimental without \nindicating the frequency of use. The psychologist quotes an unidentified source \nindicating that Applicant had a relapse while being treated by a physician from the \n\n \n5 \n \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs (VA), but does specify when the relapse occurred. The \npsychologist also mentions that Applicant received a guarded prognosis regarding his \nfuture use of illegal drugs, but does not specify who offered the prognosis or when it \nwas given. (GE 5.) \n \nThe hearing record contains additional and conflicting statements from Applicant \nregarding his history of substance abuse. In an October 2013 security clearance \napplication, Applicant reported that he received substance abuse treatment, but \nreported that he only experimented with methamphetamines on two occasions. It is \nunclear if the psychologist reviewed the October 2013 security clearance application. At \nhearing, Applicant testified that he took a leave of absence from work to address his \nsubstance abuse issues. He described his use of illegal drugs as not being serious \nenough to warrant inpatient treatment.  Applicant further testified that he did not have a \nsecurity clearance at the time he used illegal drugs and sought treatment. Since \ncompleting treatment in 2005, he denies use of any illegal substance. (GE 5.)  \n \nIn the evaluation, the psychologist discussed Applicant\u2019s diagnosis for ADHD, \nexpressing concern that Applicant received an ADHD diagnosis in his forties given that \nthe disorder usually has childhood onset and is usually diagnosed and treated before \nmidlife. However, the psychologist did not perform testing to confirm or refute the \ndiagnosis. The psychologist\u2019s doubt about the appropriateness of the ADHD diagnosis \ngiven Applicant\u2019s history of methamphetamine abuse weighs heavily in her overall \nassessment of Applicant\u2019s mental health and ongoing security worthiness. (GE 5.)  \n \nThe psychologist opined that the paranoid ideation that Applicant experienced \nresulted in the August 2013 security report could be an indication of amphetamine \nabuse, citing the low probability of an individual experiencing paranoid ideation when \ntaking amphetamines prescribed at therapeutic levels. However, the 2017 evaluation \ndoes not discuss Applicant\u2019s ADHD treatment history or medication dosages, nor does \nthe evaluation note that the psychologist reviewed any medical records relevant to the \nissue. (GE 5.) \n \nAccording to the hearing record, Applicant was diagnosed with ADHD in late \n2011 or early 2012. Medical records produced by the Government indicate that \nApplicant\u2019s physician confirmed the diagnosis in March 2014 after conducting a formal \nbattery of tests. Applicant began taking prescribed amphetamines in March 2012. His \nphysician monitored and adjusted the dosage of amphetamines as needed. When \nApplicant moved to State 1 in September 2012, he engaged a psychiatrist to monitor his \nmedication. Between October 2012 and June 2013, that psychiatrist prescribed an \namphetamine medication at a dosage of 30 milligrams (mg) above the drug \nmanufacturer\u2019s recommended daily maximum dosage. According to the manufacturer, \nparanoid ideation is a side effect of the particular amphetamine prescribed. This nine-\nmonth period precedes Applicant\u2019s August 2013 security report. When Applicant moved \nto State 2 in July 2013, he resumed treatment with the psychiatrist who treated him in \nthe months before his move to State 1. Over the next six months, the psychiatrist \nreduced the amphetamine dosage to a level 30mg below the manufacturer\u2019s \nrecommend daily maximum dosage. Since the August 2013 security report, Applicant\u2019s \n\n \n6 \n \nemployer has made no other reports of paranoid ideation or behaviors. (Tr. 49; GE 7; \nAE I.)  \n \nThe hearing record also includes treatment notes from March 2014 to June 2015. \nDuring that 18-month period, Applicant had six routine visits with his primary care \nphysician. During each visit, the doctor assessed Applicant\u2019s mental state and mood as \nappropriate. The records do not contain any concerns about paranoid ideation or any \nother concerns about Applicant\u2019s mental health. The records also do not raise any \nconcerns about Applicant misusing his ADHD medication or engaging in drug-seeking \nbehavior. In November 2014, Applicant\u2019s physician prescribed a different amphetamine \nmedication to manage Applicant\u2019s ADHD symptoms. Applicant has taken the \nprescription drug as prescribed without any noted impact on his mood. Applicant also \nprovided treatment notes from a July 2018 doctor visit. He informed the doctor about the \nconcerns raised in the 2017 evaluation about his use of stimulant medication. In \nresponse, the doctor indicated that he would review Applicant\u2019s formal testing and make \nany changes deemed necessary. Applicant denies taking his ADHD medication in a \nmanner other than prescribed. The record does not contain any instances work place or \ncriminal misconduct related to substance abuse. Applicant\u2019s wife, who has known \nApplicant since December 2013, provided a character letter on his behalf. She has not \nobserved Applicant exhibit any delusional or paranoid behavior. She believes that \nApplicant responsibly manages his ADHD medication and related medical care. GE 7; \nAE G, Q.)  \n \nDiagnosis 3: Delusional Disorder, persecutory type, severity and remission \nstatus unknown \n \n \nDuring the evaluation, Applicant denied ever having being treated for any other \nmental health problem aside from ADHD. He denied experiencing any past paranoid \nideation. Applicant also denied the mandatory EAP referral issued by his employer was \nin response to his August 2013 security report. The psychologist noted that when \nApplicant was confronted about his August 2013 security report and statements he \nmade to his physician about the ADHD medication making him feel paranoid, Applicant \ncontinued to offer either explanations that were contrary to the evidence or explanations \nthat minimized the seriousness of the reported issues. (GE 5.) \n \n \nBased on the available information, the psychologist determined there was not \nenough information to support a delusional disorder diagnosis. However, the \npsychologist expressed concerns that Applicant\u2019s paranoid ideation was not completely \nresolved based on the paranoid behavior he exhibited during the evaluation. The \nbehaviors that the psychologist classified as \u201cnot unreasonable, but uncommon\u201d \nincluded, asking the psychologist to produce identification after being asked to produce \nhis own, and expressing relief when informed that the PAI would be completed on an \nencrypted virtual private network (VPN). The psychologist also citied, as evidence of \nApplicant\u2019s ongoing paranoid ideation, his statements about government agencies \nmonitoring digital communications and his belief that his status as an employee of a \nfederal contracting company increased the likelihood that he was being monitored. The \nmonitoring, the psychologist noted, did not bother Applicant who explained that he \n\n \n7 \n \nviewed the government employees who monitor others for security risks as \u201cjust doing \ntheir jobs.\u201d Applicant explained to the psychologist that he worked on the development \nof such a monitoring program. (GE 5.) \n \n \nAdditional Psychological Concerns  \n \nIn addition to the three diagnoses described above, the psychologist also cited \nthe following as \u201cpsychological characteristics interfering with Applicant\u2019s judgment, \nreliability, trustworthiness:\u201d \n \n[Applicant] was not honest and forthcoming about his substance use \nhistory or mental health history with this examiner. Again, although \n[Applicant\u2019s] deceptiveness and guardedness make it difficult to assess \nthe current severity of his symptoms and whether they occur \nindependently of or only as a result of stimulant abuse, his deceptiveness \nin itself is a psychological characteristic that clearly intervenes with his \njudgment, reliability, and trustworthiness.  \n \nThe psychologist rated Applicant\u2019s prognosis as poor. (GE 5.) \n \n 2018 Psychological Evaluation  \n \n \nApplicant procured a second psychological evaluation after the hearing. The \nevaluation was completed by a three-person evaluation team, including a board certified \npsychologist, a post-doctoral resident in clinical psychology, and a clinical psychology \nintern. The evaluation process included a personality assessment inventory, a clinical \ninterview involving all the members of the evaluation team, and a review of the 2017 \nevaluation report. The evaluation team considered the purpose of the evaluation to \nprovide an \u201cunbiased, third-party assessment in order to provide a second opinion on \nthis matter.\u201d (AE M.) \n \nWhile the PAI scores produced a valid clinical profile, the evaluation team did not \ninterpret the results. Despite being warned against doing so, the evaluation team \ndetermined that Applicant\u2019s approach to the PAI showed an attempted \u201cmanipulation of \ntest items.\u201d As a result, the evaluation team concluded that Applicant was \u201clikely evasive \nand unwilling to admit to many personal faults.\u201d The evaluation team observed that, \n\u201c[i]ndividuals with similar profiles are often uninterested and unwilling to discuss their \nproblems.\u201d During the evaluation, Applicant provided statements and explanations \ninconsistent with those he provided during the 2017 evaluation on several topics, \nincluding: his history of mental health treatment, his history of illegal drug use, and the \npurpose of the 2013 EAP evaluation. Given the limited record review and the evaluation \nteam\u2019s finding that Applicant was an unreliable historian, the evaluation team did not \nbelieve they had enough information to make any formal or specific diagnoses. \nHowever, they reached the following conclusion: \n \n\n \n8 \n \nThis evaluation seems to be consistent with [the 2017 evaluation]. \n[Applicant] is consistently evasive and deceptive in his interview \nresponses as well as personality test results.  \n \nUnless he is confronted with evidence, [Applicant] appears to deny or \nminimize any issues that may warrant serious attention. This is a \nsignificant integrity, reliability, and trustworthiness deficit \u2026 \n \nIt is unknown at this time, due to a lack of credible information if \n[Applicant] is suffering from any mental disorders, however it is \nrecommended that he seek counseling for his current stressors. \n \nFrom a psychological perspective and as a result of extensive \npsychological testing and  evaluation, it is felt that he is not recommended \nfor a position impacting national security or involving public trust at this \ntime. He should be reevaluated. (AE M.) \n \n2019 Comprehensive Assessment \n \nIn January 2019, Applicant submitted to a \u201ccompressive assessment\u201d performed \nby a licensed clinical professional counselor (LCPC). The letter provided by the LCPC \nstates, in its entirety: \n \nI met with and conducted a Comprehensive Assessment of [Applicant] \non 15 January 2019. [Applicant] was open and forthcoming with all of the \ninformation that I asked of him. In my opinion, he is trustworthy and \ncompetent to hold a U.S. Government Security Clearance. (AE O.) \n \nThe note does not indicate what type of evaluation protocol was used or the sources of \ninformation used to reach the stated conclusion. In his post-hearing submission, \nApplicant indicated that he intended to continue \u201congoing therapeutic counseling and \nmedication management from a duly qualified mental health professional for my adult \nADHD symptoms.\u201d (AE L.) \n \nAt the hearing, Applicant appeared appropriately dressed and his mood and \ndisposition were appropriate for the setting. He provided a recent credit report and \ndriving record. Applicant has a favorable financial history and pays his creditors in a \ntimely fashion. He has a clean driving record. In addition to the character letter provided \nby his wife, Applicant also provided letters from his brother-in-law, a coworker, and his \nmanager. Applicant\u2019s brother-in-law describes Applicant as being thoughtful, \nconsiderate, and dependable. Applicant\u2019s manager echoes that sentiment, noting \nApplicant\u2019s regularity, consistency, and thoroughness in the performance of his job. \nAnother coworker described Applicant as a well-composed individual who has never \nexpressed a negative behavior or attitude. Applicant admitted that he is very security \nconscious. He stays current on all of his security training and routinely reads the \nsecurity pamphlets published by his employer. He is mindful of his surroundings and is \n\n \n9 \n \ncareful not to discuss his work in public to avoid unwittingly compromising his \nemployer\u2019s or the government\u2019s interests. (Tr. 28-29; AE F, L, P, R-S.)  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \n\n \n10 \n \nAnalysis \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s August 2013 security report raised concerns about his mental health \nand resulted in the DOD CAF requesting a psychological evaluation to determine \nApplicant\u2019s continued ability to properly handle and safeguard classified information. \nThe evaluation, completed by a licensed clinical psychologist in December 2017, raised \na number of concerns that negatively affect Applicant\u2019s ongoing security worthiness.  \n \n \nBased on the results of the December 2017 evaluation, the SOR alleges \ndisqualifying conduct under the psychological conditions, drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, alcohol consumption, and personal conduct guidelines. The \npsychologist diagnosed three disorders: alcohol use disorder, stimulant abuse disorder, \nand delusional disorder. The psychologist qualified each diagnosis as \u201cseverity and \nremission status unknown.\u201d In addition, the psychologist identified behaviors Applicant \nexhibited during the evaluation that may suggest a problem with paranoid behavior. \nHowever, the most significant finding relating to Applicant\u2019s ongoing security worthiness \nis the psychologist\u2019s negative credibility assessment. The psychologist concluded that \nApplicant was an unreliable and incredible source of information. Applicant\u2019s \ninconsistent and contradictory disclosures and his attempts to present himself in an \nuncharacteristically favorable light prevented the psychologist from making a more \ndefinitive assessment. \n \n \nHowever, it is worth noting that the 2017 evaluation is not without its flaws. The \nreport does not identify the records reviewed in reaching the conclusions presented. \nThe report alludes to, but does not detail a more extensive history of mental health \nissues as well as a more extensive history of substance abuse than reported by \nApplicant or contained in the hearing record.  Accordingly, it is unclear how many times, \nand under what circumstances Applicant received mental health or substance abuse \ntreatment in the past.  \n \n \nThe 2017 evaluation is also problematic in the way it treats Applicant\u2019s adult \nADHD diagnosis and treatment. The psychologist expressed doubt about the diagnosis \nwithout performing testing to confirm or refute it. Because of her doubts about the \nappropriateness of the diagnosis and her negative assumptions as to why Applicant \nsought treatment, she did not consider the connection between Applicant\u2019s past history \nof substance abuse and his untreated ADHD symptoms. The psychologist did not \nexamine or discuss the relationship of these factors in reaching her conclusion about \nApplicant\u2019s prognosis for future substance abuse.  \n \n \nAlthough the psychologist raised legitimate concerns about the potential dangers \nof amphetamine abuse given Applicant\u2019s history and the possible impact of long-time \namphetamine use on Applicant\u2019s mental health, these concerns are rooted in the \nassumption that Applicant is abusing his legally prescribed amphetamine medication. \nThe psychologist does not cite any contemporaneous event on which to base this \nassumption, only that she does not believe Applicant\u2019s statements that he takes his \nADHD medication as prescribed.  The psychologist also dismisses the possibility that \nthe paranoid ideation Applicant experienced resulting in the August 2013 security \n\n \n11 \n \nreport, was temporary and caused by possible overmedication by his treating \npsychiatrist. It is unclear if the psychologist reviewed any medical records from \nApplicant\u2019s treating psychiatrist or if the psychologist reviewed relevant documents and \ndecided to given them little to no weight. The record does not contain any information to \nsupport concerns about amphetamine abuse. The available medical records do not \ncontain any evidence to indicate Applicant has engaged in drug-seeking behavior or \nthat Applicant is engaged in prescription drug abuse. Nor do any of the medical records \nindicate problems with ongoing paranoid ideation or behavior. \n \n \nBecause the psychologist did not view Applicant in a favorable light, she \nconsidered his overall behavior and demeanor problematic. The psychologist elevated \nbehaviors she described as \u201cunusual, but not unreasonable,\u201d as being evidence of \npotentially unresolved paranoid behavior. Because of Applicant\u2019s lack of credibility, the \npsychologist determined that the only way to justify Applicant\u2019s behavior was to \u201cchoose \nbetween a susceptibility to paranoid delusions, paranoia induced by amphetamine or \nmethamphetamine abuse, or both.\u201d The psychologist did not consider any benign \nmotivations for Applicant\u2019s behavior and statements.  \n \n \nOf particular concern to the psychologist were Applicant\u2019s statements about \ngovernment monitoring of his electronic communications.  In evaluating the significance \nof these statements, context is key. In the psychological evaluation, Applicant exhibited \nan indifferent attitude toward the occasional and passive government monitoring of his \ndigital communications1 as opposed to the active, targeted, and malicious intentions of \nunknown actors he reported in the August 2013 report. Aside from noting the behaviors, \nthe psychologist does not indicate that Applicant\u2019s concerns caused him to refuse to \nparticipate or cooperate in the evaluation protocol. Applicant is extraordinarily security \nconscious. He is hyper-vigilant about his environment and security practices. His \nbehavior and statements during the interview are in line with these personality traits. \nThe security concerns raised by these behaviors are resolved in Applicant\u2019s favor.  \n \n \n Despite the flaws in the evaluation report, the psychologist identified a security \nconcern not previously raised in prior adjudications of Applicant\u2019s security clearance. \nThe psychologist determined that Applicant possessed psychological characteristics \nthat may impair his judgment, stability, reliability, or trustworthiness.  Specifically, his \ndeceptiveness and failure to provide full, frank, and candid disclosures regarding \nadverse information until confronted with evidence. The psychologist rated Applicant\u2019s \nprognosis as poor. The observations regarding Applicant\u2019s lack of credibility, \nevasiveness, deceptiveness and the adverse effect on Applicant\u2019s continued security \nworthiness, were corroborated by the team of duly-qualified mental health professionals \nApplicant retained in December 2018 for an independent psychological evaluation.  \n \n  \n                                                          \n1 Applicant\u2019s statements regarding government monitoring of electronic communications are not incorrect.  \nGovernment information systems are routinely monitored, and warnings about such monitoring are \ndisplayed each time a user logs on to government information system. Also, government monitoring of \nthe electronic communications of private citizens has long been the subject of law suit filed by civil rights \norganizations. See, e.g., https://www.aclu.org/issues/national-security/privacy-and-surveillance. \n\n \n12 \n \n \nThe record supports a finding that following disqualifying conditions apply: \n \n\uf0b7 Psychological Conditions Disqualifying Condition 28(b): an \nopinion by a duly qualified mental health professional that the \nindividual has a condition that may impair judgment, stability, \nreliability, or trustworthiness;  \n\uf0b7 Personal Conduct Disqualifying Condition 16(b): deliberately \nproviding false or misleading information; or concealing or omitting \ninformation, concerning relevant facts to a \u2026mental health \nprofessional involved in making a recommendation relevant to \nnational security eligibility determination\u2026; \n\uf0b7 Personal Conduct Disqualifying Condition 16(c): credible \nadverse information in several adjudicative areas that is not \nsufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a \nwhole-person assessment of \u2026 unreliability [and] lack of candor \u2026 \nor other characteristics indication that the individual may not \nproperly safeguard classified or sensitive information; \n\uf0b7 Alcohol Consumption Disqualifying Condition 22(d): diagnosis \nby a duly qualified medical or mental health professional of alcohol \nuse disorder; and  \n\uf0b7 Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse Disqualifying \nCondition 25(d): diagnosis by a duly qualified medical or mental \nhealth professional of substance use disorder. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nIf considered separately, the concerns regarding Applicant\u2019s history of alcohol \nand substance abuse and the August 2013 incident report may not warrant \ndisqualification. The record does not contain any recent adverse reports from law \nenforcement or Applicant\u2019s employer indicating that he has current problems with these \nissues. However, when Applicant\u2019s history is considered together with the credibility \nconcerns identified in the 2017 and 2018 psychological evaluation reports, the record \nsupports a negative whole-person assessment that indicates an inability to properly \nhandle or safeguard classified information.  \n \n \nApplicant contends that his statements regarding his current alcohol consumption \nhabits and continued abstention from illegal drug use, his compliance with his ADHD \ntreatment plan, his favorable assessment of his overall mental health as supported by \nthe January 2019 comprehensive assessment, and his plan to participate in counseling \nmitigates any potential security concerns. They do not. Because Applicant has provided \ninconsistent statements about his substance abuse history and mental health treatment \nhistory, as well as his propensity to present himself in an uncharacteristically favorable \nmanner, his testimony carries little weight. Applicant\u2019s statements that he will receive \nongoing therapeutic counseling from an LCPC also fail to mitigate the alleged security \n\n \n13 \n \nconcerns. Applicant did not present any information regarding the nature and scope of \nthe therapeutic counseling, nor has Applicant demonstrated that he acknowledges or \nunderstands the concerns raised in the 2017 and 2018 evaluations. The January 2019 \ncomprehensive assessment, indicating that Applicant is trustworthy and competent to \nhold a security clearance, is also insufficient evidence of mitigation. The assessment \ndoes not provide any basis for this conclusion or any explanation to refute the \nconclusions in the 2017 and 2018 evaluations. Nor does it provide a favorable \nprognosis for any of the identified issues. Accordingly, none of the mitigating conditions \navailable under the alleged guidelines apply.  \n \nWhole Person Assessment \n \n \nApplicant is a long-time clearance holder. He takes his responsibilities to adhere \nto security produces and regulations very seriously. He is always cognizant of and \nvigilant in his surroundings. He approaches his work with a positive attitude and \nexecutes his tasks with regularity, consistency, and thoroughness. Despite this \nfavorable information, doubts remain about his ongoing security worthiness. In reaching \nthis conclusion, I have also considered the whole-person factors at AG \u00b6 2(d).  \n \n \nThe purpose of the security clearance adjudication is to make \u201can examination of \na sufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the person \nis an acceptable security risk.\u201d (AG \u00b6 2(d).) The 2017 and 2018 psychological \nevaluations independently reached conclusions supporting a negative-whole person \nassessment. Applicant\u2019s inability to acknowledge or deal with his problems raises \nconcerns about his judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness that make his continued \naccess to classified information an unacceptable security risk. As the August 2013 \nsecurity report shows, Applicant will report any perceived security threat in his external \nenvironment. However, the evaluations raise concerns that he will not acknowledge, \nadmit, or report potential security issues raised by his own behavior, preventing the \ngovernment from fully assessing Applicant\u2019s security worthiness.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Psychological Conditions  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.c, 1.e: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Personal Conduct  \n \nAGAINST APPPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a:   \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 3, Alcohol Consumption \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n14 \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 3.a:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 4, Drug Involvement and  \n \nSubstance Misuse  \n \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraph 4.a:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented, it is not clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant Applicant a security clearance.

Temple, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n______________ \nDecision \n______________ \nMATCHINSKI, Elizabeth M., Administrative Judge: \nApplicant did not timely file his Federal and state income tax returns for tax years \n2012 through 2016. His delinquent tax returns were filed in the fall of 2017, but more than \n$35,000 in past-due consumer credit debt and $1,678 in delinquent property taxes had not \nbeen resolved as of September 2018. He is in the process of filing for bankruptcy, but \nfinancial judgment concerns persist. Clearance is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn April 20, 2018, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility \n(DOD CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, detailing security concerns \nunder Guideline F, financial considerations. The SOR explained why the DOD CAF was \nunable to find it clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue security \nclearance eligibility for him. The DOD CAF took the action under Executive Order (EO) \n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the National Security Adjudicative \n12/06/2018\n\n2 \n \nGuidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to \nHold a Sensitive Position (AG) effective within the DOD on June 8, 2017. \n \nApplicant responded to the SOR on May 14, 2018, and requested a hearing before \nan administrative judge from the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA). On July \n18, 2018, the case was assigned to me to conduct a hearing to determine whether it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for \nApplicant. On August 6, 2018, I scheduled a hearing for September 19, 2018. \n \nAt the hearing, three Government exhibits (GEs 1-3) were admitted. A June 28, \n2018 letter forwarding the proposed GEs to Applicant was marked as a hearing exhibit (HE \n1) for the record but not admitted in evidence. Eleven Applicant exhibits (AEs A-K) were \nadmitted in evidence. Applicant testified, as reflected in a transcript (Tr.) received on \nSeptember 28, 2018. \n \nI held the record open for one month for post-hearing documentation from Applicant. \nThere is no indication that Applicant submitted any matters for the record by the October \n18, 2018 deadline. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nThe SOR alleges under Guideline F that Applicant failed to timely file his Federal \n(SOR \u00b6 1.a) and state (SOR \u00b6 1.b) income tax returns for tax years 2011 through 2016, \nand that he owed $27,748 in past-due consumer credit debt on a total balance of $36,702, \nand $1,678 in delinquent property taxes. Applicant admitted that he had not filed his \nincome tax returns on time as alleged, but indicated that his returns have been filed. \nApplicant admitted the outstanding indebtedness as alleged, and explained that his \nattorney has prepared a Chapter 13 bankruptcy filing. After considering the pleadings, \nexhibits, and transcript, I make the following findings of fact. \n \nApplicant is a 69-year-old engineering technician, who has worked for his defense-\ncontractor employer since July 1969. He earned an associate\u2019s degree in January 1983 \nand a bachelor\u2019s degree in July 1996. He has never married, but has affection for a \ngodchild. Applicant seeks to retain a secret clearance that he has held throughout his \ncareer. (GE 1; Tr. 38-40, 43.) \n \nAn ex-nephew by marriage to Applicant\u2019s niece lived with Applicant from 2010 until \nMarch 2018, when he was arrested for a reason not explained in the record. This nephew \nabused Applicant (AE A) and took advantage of Applicant financially.1 He ran up debt on \nApplicant\u2019s credit card account in SOR \u00b6 1.c, which Applicant had given him for a couple of \nmonths to use for gasoline expenses. (Tr. 49.) His nephew used the card for other \nexpenses as well. As Applicant paid down the balances, his nephew \u201ccharged it up again.\u201d \nApplicant also used the credit card for purchases. Applicant ran into trouble because he \n                                                 \n1 Applicant endured the abuse because his nephew was custodial parent on the weekends for Applicant\u2019s \ngodchild. Applicant\u2019s godchild, who is very special to Applicant, spent the weekends at Applicant\u2019s house when \nher mother was working. (Tr. 43.)  \n\n3 \n \n\u201cwas actually spending the money, and then paying it off.\u201d At some point, Applicant was \neither unable or unwilling to make the payments according to the terms of his account, and \nthe creditor charged off a balance of $17,059 in November 2014. (Tr. 49-50.) Applicant \nused another credit card (SOR \u00b6 1.d) to pay for the restoration of electricity service for \nsome family members. (Tr. 54-55, 64.) \n \nApplicant did not file his Federal or state income tax returns for tax years 2011 \nthrough 2016 when they were due.2 Applicant\u2019s explanation for his non-filing is that his \nnephew drank excessively and \u201ctrashed [Applicant\u2019s] records several times.\u201d Applicant did \nnot have all the records needed to file his tax returns, and he did not then know how to \nobtain them. Apparently because of the cost (\u201cit was like $2,000 to go out and get an \naccountant to pull the\u2014to be able to file for the 2011, the 2012 [tax years]\u201d), Applicant did \nnot seek professional assistance. He rationalized that he had already paid his income \ntaxes because his income tax withholdings were more than sufficient to cover his tax \nliabilities. (Tr. 33-34, 36, 41-44.) \n \nTo renew his security clearance eligibility, Applicant completed and certified to the \naccuracy of a Questionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86) on January 13, 2016. \nHe responded affirmatively to a financial-record inquiry concerning whether he had failed to \nfile or pay Federal, state, or other taxes when required by law or ordinance in the last \nseven years. He disclosed that he had not filed his Federal or state income tax returns for \ntax years 2011 through 2014. He estimated his tax liabilities at $1,200 per year for those \ntax years and indicated that he was working with a certified public accountant to prepare \nand file his delinquent tax returns. In response to inquiries concerning delinquency on \nroutine accounts, Applicant disclosed that he owed $2,885 in bank-overdraft fees (SOR \u00b6 \n1.f), and $16,000 (SOR \u00b6 1.c) and $2,000 (SOR \u00b6 1.g) in past-due credit-card debt. He \nexplained that he was working with a credit counselor \u201cto develop a sustainable plan to \nresolve [his] deficiencies.\u201d (GE 1.) \n \nAs of February 9, 2016, Applicant\u2019s accounts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c and 1.g had been \ncharged off and were in collection for $17,059 and $1,840. His bank-overdraft account \n(SOR \u00b6 1.f) had been charged off for $2,885 in July 2013, and he owed an accrued \nbalance of $3,464. Applicant was also 60 days past due on a loan balance of $3,070 for an \nautomobile redeemed after repossession. He was making payments according to terms \nacceptable to his creditors on credit cards with balances of $15,767 and $9,551 (SOR \u00b6 \n1.d). A line of credit for $1,000 with a credit union was current with a $938 balance (SOR \u00b6 \n1.i). (GE 3.) \n \nIn May 2017, Applicant consulted with an attorney about filing a Chapter 13 \nbankruptcy petition. The attorney advised Applicant on June 13, 2017, that he was not able \nto represent him (AE C), apparently because the attorney did not know enough about \nApplicant\u2019s tax situation. (Tr. 34-35, 42.) \n \nApplicant consulted with another attorney (attorney X), who advised him to obtain \nhis account transcripts from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). (AE B; Tr. 34-35.) After \n                                                 \n2 Applicant works in a state that collects taxes on non-residents that earn income in the state. \n\n4 \n \nobtaining the documents needed to prepare his delinquent tax returns, Applicant then \nconsulted with an enrolled tax agent, who prepared his Federal and state income tax \nreturns for tax years 2012 through 2015 on September 13, 2017, and for tax years 2011 \nand 2016 on October 16, 2017.3 (AEs E-J.) On adjusted gross income of $166,415 for tax \nyear 2011, he owed the IRS $4,425 and the state $86. (AE E.) On adjusted gross income \nof $137,338 for tax year 2012, he owed the IRS $2,101. He expected a refund of $32 in \nstate taxes. (AE F.) On adjusted gross income of $112,164 for tax year 2013, he overpaid \nhis Federal taxes by $1,595 and his state income taxes by $176. (AE G.) On adjusted \ngross income of $98,014 for tax year 2014, he overpaid his Federal income taxes by \n$1,530 and his state income taxes by $207. (AE H.) On adjusted gross income of $83,922 \nfor tax year 2015, he expected a Federal income tax refund of $1,671 and a state income \ntax refund of $218. (AE I.) On adjusted gross income of $90,820 for tax year 2016, he \noverpaid his Federal income taxes by $1,987 and his state income taxes by $219.4 (AE J.) \nApplicant incurred tax preparation fees of $365 for his 2014 tax returns (AE H), $319 for his \n2015 tax returns (AE I), and $1,987 for his 2016 tax returns (AE J). Applicant understands \nthat he forfeited his tax refunds for those tax years where his returns were filed more than \nthree years after the returns were first due. (Tr. 35.) Applicant testified that he returned a \ntax refund check to the IRS and had it applied to his Federal tax liabilities, which because \nof assessed penalties and likely also interest totaled $9,000 to $10,000 as of September \n2018. He testified that he was making payments of $100 a month to the IRS. (Tr. 46-47.) At \nApplicant\u2019s request, I held the record open after the hearing for him to document his \nFederal tax balance and his payments to the IRS. No documents were received.  \n \nApplicant had the same tax agent prepare his Federal and state income tax returns \nfor tax year 2017. She completed the returns on September 17, 2018. On adjusted gross \nincome of $91,189,5 he expected refunds of $1,873 from the IRS and $218 from the state. \nHe incurred fees totaling $473 for the tax preparation. (AE K.) \n \nAs of April 2018, Applicant had made no progress toward resolving his delinquent \nconsumer-credit accounts. He owed charged-off credit-card balances of $17,059 (SOR \u00b6 \n1.c) and $1,840 (SOR \u00b6 1.g). In December 2017, the credit union identified in SOR \u00b6 1.d \n                                                 \n3 Both the IRS and the state allow for a six-month extension of the tax deadline, which was April 18, 2017, for \ntax year 2016. However, there is no evidence that Applicant filed for extensions by the April 18, 2017 tax \ndeadline. With his income tax returns prepared for tax year 2016 on October 16, 2017, Applicant was advised \nthat if he had filed for an extension, the return must be filed by October 15 and that any balance due had to be \npaid by April 18, 2017, to avoid penalties and interest. (AE J.) \n \n4 Applicant\u2019s belatedly-filed income tax returns show that his adjusted gross income has routinely exceeded his \nwage income primarily because of pension income. His wages for tax year 2011 were $67,964, and he had \npension income of $97,977. (AE E.) His wages for tax year 2012 were $77,092, and his pension income was \n$57,425. (AE F.) His wages for tax year 2013 were $87,769, and his taxable pension income was $24,161. \n(AE G.) His wages for tax year 2014 declined to $75,729, and his pension income was $19,163. (AE H.) His \nwages for tax year 2015 further declined to $68,757, and his pension income was $14,773. (AE I.) His wages \nfor tax year 2016 increased to $76,083, and his pension income was $14,681. (AE J.) Applicant did not explain \nthe source(s) of his pension income. He is of age to collect Social Security income, but Social Security income \nis not included in gross income. He admitted at his hearing that he had taken individual retirement account \ndistributions to pay bills. (Tr. 66.) \n \n5Applicant\u2019s wage income for 2017 was $76,333, and his pension income was $13,960. (AE K.)  \n\n5 \n \ncharged off his account for $8,801. His account in SOR \u00b6 1.e had been placed for \ncollection in May 2016 for $3,476. (Tr. 55-56.) He owed a charged-off balance of $3,464 on \nan overdraft account (SOR \u00b6 1.f) and $1,305 on a charged-off automobile loan (SOR \u00b6 1.h) \nobtained in May 2016. His line of credit in SOR \u00b6 1.i was an overdraft account attached to \na checking account. It was $60 past due on a balance of $957 (SOR \u00b6 1.i). (GE 2.) \n \nAs of September 18, 2018, attorney X was in the process of preparing a Chapter 13 \nbankruptcy petition for Applicant to resolve his delinquent debts. Attorney X attests that \nApplicant was fully cooperative and diligent in providing the documentation needed to \ncomplete the petition. (AE B.) Other evidence indicates that the delay in filing for \nbankruptcy was caused in part by Applicant not following up to ensure that he was \nreceiving correspondence from attorney X\u2019s office. When asked about the delay in filing his \nbankruptcy petition, Applicant responded: \n \nA couple months ago, I was like\u2014I haven\u2019t figure out, and, you know\u2014and \nwhat they did were sending me and email. I didn\u2019t get anything in the\u2014and it \nwas so. It was so hot that I really was just going home. I know it doesn\u2019t \nsound right, but I was just going home after work. I did stop in, and I was \nusing the other email account . . . and that\u2019s what they were\u2014what [name \nomitted] was messaging me on, and so we got everything squared away. (Tr. \n71.) \n \nApplicant wants his creditors to be \u201cmade whole.\u201d (Tr. 36, 51.) He intends to include \nthe debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c and 1.e on his bankruptcy petition. (Tr. 52, 56.) Sometime during \nthe week preceding his security-clearance hearing, the creditor owed the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.d and 1.i offered to accept less than his balances to settle the debts. Applicant did not \nrecall the settlement amounts, but he plans to pay them. Regarding the overdraft debt in \nSOR \u00b6 1.f, Applicant testified that he \u201cgot in trouble\u201d after the bank starting charging $60 to \n$70 a month against the reserve credit attached to the account. He did not look at his \nstatements. (Tr. 58.) He testified that it will be paid. (Tr. 59.) As for the $1,000 credit line in \nSOR \u00b6 1.g, he similarly had made no payments toward the debt, but indicated that it will be \npaid. (Tr. 60.) Applicant incurred the $1,305 vehicle debt in SOR \u00b6 1.h when he totaled the \ncar in a weather-related accident in early 2017 and lacked gap insurance. He was forced to \nrent a car for eight to nine months and did not pay the balance remaining on his car loan. \n(Tr. 60-63.) \n \nApplicant does not dispute that he owes delinquent property taxes of $1,678 for his \nhome, although he does not understand why the debt was not paid because the bank was \nwithdrawing funds to pay his property taxes. (Tr. 64-65.) He has a mortgage on his home \nthat he obtained in September 2003 for $79,800. As of February 2018, his home loan was \nrated as current with a $58,468 balance, although it had been delinquent in May 2017 and \nJuly 2017. (GE 2.) His monthly mortgage payment is $586. He has a car payment of $480 \nper month for a 2017 model-year vehicle. He no longer provides any financial support for \nanyone else. He has one open credit-card account that has a balance of almost $15,000. \nHe is current on his payments. Applicant has a total of about $1,000 in his savings and \nchecking accounts. (Tr. 67-70.) \n\n6 \n \n \n Applicant earns $38 an hour in his defense-contractor job. He has taken \nwithdrawals from an individual retirement account to pay some of his bills. He exhausted \nthat asset so he no longer has that source of income available to him. (Tr. 66-67.) \n \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion the Executive \nBranch has in regulating access to information pertaining to national security,  emphasizing \nthat \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, \nthe administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be considered in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. These guidelines \nare not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, \nthese guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative \nprocess. The administrative judge\u2019s overall adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative \njudge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, \nfavorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence \nto establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant \nis responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation about potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7 of EO 10865 \nprovides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section \n3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information). \n\n7 \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \n \n \nThe security concerns about financial considerations are articulated in AG \u00b6 18: \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness \nto abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or \nsensitive information. Financial distress can also be caused or exacerbated \nby, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other issues of personnel security \nconcern such as excessive gambling, mental health conditions, substance \nmisuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . . \n \n \nThe Appeal Board explained the scope and rationale for the financial considerations \nsecurity concern in ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) (citation omitted) \nas follows: \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money in satisfaction of \nhis or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the totality of an \napplicant\u2019s financial history and circumstances. The Judge must consider \npertinent evidence regarding the applicant\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other \nqualities essential to protecting the national secrets as well as the \nvulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive presumes a \nnexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines and an \napplicant\u2019s security eligibility. \n \nApplicant did not timely file his Federal and state income tax returns for tax years \n2011 through 2016. Assuming that his ex-nephew destroyed some of his records, it is \ndifficult to believe that his nephew destroyed the records needed for timely filing for six \nconsecutive years. Applicant rationalized his non-filing at the time on the basis that he \nlacked the intent to defraud the government because he had taxes withheld from his pay \nthat would amply cover his liabilities. Based on the tax returns that were prepared in \nSeptember 2017 and October 2017 for tax years 2011 through 2016, Applicant overpaid \nhis Federal income taxes for tax years 2013 through 2016 and his state income taxes for \ntax years 2012 through 2016. Guideline F security concerns are established when an \nindividual fails to comply with his tax filing obligations whether or not any taxes are owed. \nDisqualifying condition AG \u00b6 19(f), \u201cfailure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, \nor local income tax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired,\u201d applies. \n \n\n8 \n \nThe evidence also establishes a record of consumer-credit delinquency and \nproperty-tax delinquency. As of February 2016, he owed $17,059 (SOR \u00b6 1.c), $3,464 \n(SOR 1.d), and $1,840 (SOR \u00b6 1.f) on charged-off accounts. After consulting with attorney \nX about possibly filing a Chapter 13 bankruptcy petition, Applicant defaulted on the credit-\ncard accounts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d and 1.e, on the car loan in SOR \u00b6 1.h, and on the line of \ncredit in SOR \u00b6 1.i. He also did not pay a property tax debt of $1,678 (SOR \u00b6 1.j). \nDisqualifying conditions AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), \u201cinability to satisfy debts,\u201d and 19(c), \u201ca history of not \nmeeting financial obligations,\u201d also apply. \n \nApplicant has the burden of establishing that matters in mitigation apply. One or \nmore of the following conditions under AG \u00b6 20 may apply: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under \nsuch circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem from a \nlegitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit counseling service, \nand there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under \ncontrol; \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue; and  \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n \n \nRegarding his tax-filing issues, Applicant\u2019s failure to file timely Federal and state \nincome tax returns for six consecutive tax years, from 2011 through 2016, is too recurrent \nand recent for mitigation under AG \u00b6 20(a). Assuming that Applicant\u2019s nephew \u201ctrashed\u201d \nsome of the documents that Applicant needed to file his income tax returns for tax year \n2011 and possibly 2012, it would be an unforeseen circumstance that could partially \nimplicate AG \u00b6 20(b). However, it stretches credulity that Applicant\u2019s nephew would have \ndestroyed the paperwork that Applicant needed to file his tax returns for six consecutive tax \n\n9 \n \nyears. Moreover, although Applicant testified that he did not then know how he could obtain \nthe needed records, he also indicated that he could have retained an accountant to assist \nhim in filing his returns, but that it would have cost him approximately $2,000. Applicant did \nnot act responsibly within AG \u00b6 20(b) by taking no action for several years to rectify his tax \nsituation. His failure to file is not excused or justified by the fact that he had taxes withheld \nfrom his pay and was owed refunds for some years. \n \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s favor, he filed his delinquent income tax returns for tax years 2012 \nthrough 2015 in September 2017 and for tax years 2011 and 2016 in October 2017, before \nthe SOR was issued. AG \u00b6 20(g) partially applies, but he still owes approximately $9,000 to \n$10,000 to the IRS for tax years 2011 and 2012. His belated filing of his income tax returns \nfor tax years 2011 through 2016 is some indication that the problem of his noncompliance \nwith his tax-filing obligations \u201cis being resolved or is under control\u201d under AG \u00b6 20(c). He \nhad the same enrolled tax agent prepare his tax returns for 2017. His Federal and state \nincome tax returns for tax year 2017 were completed on September 17, 2018, and were \ntimely if he filed for an extension of the April 17, 2018 deadline. However, he did not \nprovide documentation of his claimed installment plan with the IRS to address his \noutstanding tax liabilities for tax years 2011 and 2012. \n \n \nEven where tax problems have been corrected and an applicant is motivated to \nprevent such problems in the future, the administrative judge is not precluded from \nconsidering an applicant\u2019s trustworthiness in light of longstanding prior behavior evidencing \nirresponsibility. See e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 2015). The Appeal \nBoard has long held that the failure to file tax returns suggests a problem with complying \nwith well-established government rules and systems. See e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-04437 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 15, 2016.) When he completed his SF 86 in January 2016, Applicant \nindicated that he was working with a certified public accountant to file his delinquent returns \nfor tax years 2011 through 2014. He exhibited poor judgment by then not filing his tax \nreturns for 2015 and 2016 when they were due. There is no corroboration of any effort to \nrectify his tax-filing issues before May 2017, when he consulted with an attorney. His tax \nsituation is not fully resolved in that he owes $9,000 to $10,000 to the IRS because of \npenalties related to his delinquent tax filings. He claimed that he is on a repayment plan to \naddress the tax debt at $100 a month, but it is unclear how many payments have been \nmade. He submitted no records of payments, even though I held the record open after the \nhearing for such documentation. His federal tax situation is only partially resolved. \n \nApplicant also showed poor financial judgment in his handling of his personal credit, \nas evidenced by his outstanding consumer-credit delinquencies exceeding $35,000 as of \nApril 2018 and by his unpaid past-due property taxes for $1,678. Applicant stopped paying \non his credit-card account in SOR \u00b6 1.d, his credit line in SOR \u00b6 1.i, and his car loan in \nSOR 1.h after he consulted with an attorney about filing for bankruptcy, but other debts had \nbeen charged off for several years with no efforts to repay them (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c and 1.e-1.g). \nAG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply to outstanding delinquency incurred because of overspending or \nother financial mismanagement. Regarding the overdraft debt in SOR \u00b6 1.f, Applicant \ntestified that he \u201cgot in trouble\u201d after the bank starting charging $60 to $70 a month against \n\n10 \n \nthe reserve credit attached to the account. He bears some responsibility because he did \nreview his bank statements. \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b) has very limited applicability in mitigation of his delinquent consumer-\ncredit debts. Applicant incurred the $1,305 vehicle debt in SOR \u00b6 1.h when he totaled the \ncar in a weather-related accident in early 2017 and lacked gap insurance. He was forced to \nrent a car for eight to nine months and did not pay the balance remaining on his car loan. \nThe accident is an unexpected circumstance contemplated within AG \u00b6 20(b). Applicant \ngave his nephew access to his credit card in SOR \u00b6 1.c, apparently so that his nephew \ncould pay for gasoline on trips to pick up Applicant\u2019s godchild for the weekends. His \nnephew used the card for additional purchases that Applicant did not foresee. However, \nApplicant also allowed his nephew continued access to his account after Applicant had \npaid down substantial debt incurred by his nephew on the account. Applicant\u2019s use of \nanother credit card (SOR \u00b6 1.d) to pay electricity bills for some family members was within \nhis control. Applicant showed poor financial judgment by not reviewing his bank statements \nfor the overdraft account in SOR \u00b6 1.f. \n \nIt would be premature to mitigate the financial considerations security concerns \nraised by Applicant\u2019s consumer delinquencies and unpaid property taxes. Although a \nChapter 13 bankruptcy filing is a legal means to address debts, a petition had yet to be \nfiled as of his September 2018 security-clearance hearing. Applicant was not proactive in \ncorresponding with his bankruptcy attorney, and so he bears some responsibility for the \nfiling delay.  Assuming that Applicant files a Chapter 13 plan that is approved by the \nbankruptcy court, he will be required to make monthly payments. Given the lack of \nprogress toward resolving his delinquent accounts over the years, there is insufficient \nguarantee that he can be counted on to comply with a Chapter 13 plan. Neither AG \u00b6 20(c) \nnor AG \u00b6 20(d) apply. The financial considerations security concerns are not adequately \nmitigated. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nIn assessing the whole person, the administrative judge must consider the totality of \nan applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative \nprocess factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). The analysis under Guideline F is incorporated in my whole-\nperson analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were addressed under that guideline, but \nsome warrant additional comment. \n \n \nThe security clearance adjudication involves an evaluation of an applicant\u2019s \njudgment, reliability, and trustworthiness in light of the security guidelines in the Directive. \nSee ISCR Case No. 09-02160 (App. Bd. Jun. 21, 2010). Applicant presented no evidence \nfrom his workplace, but it may reasonably be inferred from his 49-year tenure with his \nemployer that he is dedicated to his work and is a valued employee. At the same time, his \nwage income has consistently exceeded the threshold required for timely filing of Federal \nand state income tax returns. His reasons for not filing his tax returns on time do not \nmitigate or justify his failure to comply with such an important obligation. He has mitigated \n\n11 \n \nthe tax issues somewhat by filing his delinquent returns, but he owes between $9,000 and \n$10,000 in federal taxes because of assessed penalties for the late returns. \n \n \nApplicant allowed his feelings of concern and affection for his godchild to get the \nbetter of his financial judgment in that he provided a home for her father (his ex-nephew) \nfor over five years and gave him one of his credit cards to use for a couple of months. \nApplicant assumed the risk to his credit and the responsibility to pay balances incurred by \nthis nephew. Applicant helped other family members by paying their utility bills with another \nof his credit cards. However well-intentioned Applicant may have been in helping these \nfamily members, he has legal repayment obligations that remain unresolved. He has relied \non withdrawals from a retirement account to pay some of his bills, which indicates a \nproblem managing his money. The Appeal Board has repeatedly held that the government \nneed not wait until an applicant mishandles or fails to safeguard classified information \nbefore denying or revoking security clearance eligibility. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 08-\n09918 (App. Bd. Oct. 29, 2009) (citing Adams v. Laird, 420 F.2d 230, 238-239 (D.C. Cir. \n1969)). It is well settled that once a concern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s security \nclearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or renewal of a security \nclearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th Cir. 1990). His failure to give \npriority to his tax and credit obligations causes doubts about his security worthiness that \nhave not been fully mitigated. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.c-1.j: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it not is clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for \naccess to classified information is denied. \n \n \n_____________________ \nElizabeth M. Matchinski \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.  \nStatement of the Case \nOn April 9, 2015, Applicant completed an electronic Questionnaire for Investigation \nProcessing (e-QIP). On April 30, 2018, the Department of Defense Consolidated \nAdjudications Facility (DOD CAF) issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) \ndetailing security concerns under Guideline F, financial considerations. The action was \ntaken under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \n(Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) effective within the DOD on June 8, 2017. \nApplicant answered the SOR on May 29, 2018, and elected to have his case \ndecided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. Department Counsel submitted the \nGovernment\u2019s file of relevant material (FORM), and Applicant received it on June 25, \n12/21/2018\n\n \n2 \n \n \n2018. The Government\u2019s evidence is identified as Items 1 through 6. Applicant was \nafforded an opportunity to file objections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, \nor mitigation within 30 days of receipt of the FORM. He did not provide a response, \nobjections, or submit documents. Items 1 through 6 are admitted without objection. The \ncase was assigned to me on November 19, 2018.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant admitted the sole SOR allegation. After a thorough and careful review of \nthe pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact. \n \n \nApplicant is 34 years old. He is a high school graduate. He served in the military \nfrom 2003 to 2012 and was honorably discharged in the paygrade E-5. He was married \nfrom 2006 to 2007. He has no children. He has been employed since December 2014.1  \n \n \nApplicant disclosed on his April 2015 e-QIP that he failed to file and pay his 2012 \nfederal income tax return. He stated: \u201cRecently discharge[d] from the military at the time \n[and] was unemployed and unable to pay the amount owed.\u201d2 He estimated he owed \n$6,000. He further stated: \u201cRequested reissuance of 2012 W-2 from DFAS3 as I am \nunable to access, once W-2 is received taxes will be filed and amount paid.\u201d4 \n \n \nApplicant was interviewed by a government investigator in October 2017. He \ndiscussed his failure to file his 2012 federal tax return. He said that he had entered his \ninformation to an online tax program, but did not file and panicked when he found out he \nmight owe $6,000 in taxes. He did not have the money to pay the total amount to the IRS. \nHe said he subsequently lost his W-2. He attempted to obtain a new W-2. He contacted \nDFAS for a copy, but had not received a response. He said he failed to contact the IRS \nand make payment arrangements. He intended to contact DFAS again and request a \ncopy of the W-2 and file his 2012 federal tax return. He anticipated this would be \ncompleted by April 2018.5 \n \n \nApplicant answered government interrogatories in March 2018. In them he stated: \n\u201cI have requested a 2012 W-2 from DFAS to ensure that any taxes owed are paid[,] but \nhave not received it yet. When I do[,] I will file and set a payment plan.\u201d6 \n \n                                                          \n1 Item 4. \n \n2 Item 4. \n \n3 Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS).  \n \n4 Item 4.  \n \n5 Item 5.  \n \n6 Item 6. \n\n \n3 \n \n \n \nApplicant did not provide a response to the FORM or any evidence to show he has \nfiled his 2012 federal income tax return or paid any amount owed.  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information).  \n\n \n4 \n \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set out \nin AG & 18:  \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n \nAG \u00b6 19 provides conditions that could raise security concerns. The following is \npotentially applicable:  \n \n \n(g) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired.  \n \n \nApplicant failed to timely file his 2012 federal income tax return. There is sufficient \nevidence to support the application of the above disqualifying condition. \n \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements.  \n \n \nApplicant admitted he failed to timely file his federal income return for tax year \n2012. He has been aware since completing his April 2015 e-QIP that his failure to file his \ntax return was an issue. He provided insufficient evidence to show he is responsibly \naddressing his tax issue. His tax issues are not resolved. AG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply. \n \n \nApplicant did not file his 2012 federal income tax return because he did not have \nthe money to pay the amount he believed he owed. This does not constitute a condition \nbeyond his control. He then lost his W-2. He has repeatedly said he was requesting a \ncopy from DFAS, but had not received it. This may have initially been beyond his control, \nbut Applicant has not presented sufficient evidence to show when he made the request, \nhow many requests he made, his follow-up actions, and if he contacted the IRS to arrange \na payment plan. Applicant has not acted responsibly. I find AG \u00b6 20(b) and AG \u00b6 20(g) \ndo not apply.  \n \n \nIt is unknown if Applicant sought financial counseling, and there are not clear \nindications at this time to conclude the problem is being resolved. AG \u00b6 20(c) does not \napply.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n\n \n6 \n \n \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \n \nApplicant is 34 years old. He failed to file his 2012 federal income tax return \nbecause he did not have the money at the time to pay what he thought he owed. In 2015, \nafter completing his e-QIP he was on notice that this was a security concern. The DOHA \nAppeal Board has held that:  \n \nFailure to file tax returns suggests that an applicant has a problem with \ncomplying with well-established government rules and systems. Voluntary \ncompliance with these things is essential for protecting classified \ninformation. ISCR Case No. 14-04437 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 15, 2016). \nSomeone who fails repeatedly to fulfill his or her legal obligations does not \ndemonstrate the high degree of good judgment and reliability required of \nthose granted access to classified information. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. \n14-01894 at 5 (App. Bd. August 18, 2015). See Cafeteria & Restaurant \nWorkers Union Local 473 v. McElroy, 284 F.2d 173, 183 (D.C. Cir. 1960), \naff\u2019d, 367 U.S. 886 (1961). 7 \n \nApplicant has not provided evidence that the delinquent tax return is filed, and he \nhas paid what is owed or has a payment plan with the IRS. Applicant has not met his \nburden of persuasion. The record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns arising under Guideline F, \nfinancial considerations. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                          \n7 ISCR Case No. 12-10933 at 3 (App. Bd.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact The SOR alleges under Guideline F that Applicant filed a Chapter 13 bankruptcy in or about December 2008 that was dismissed in or about December 2008 (SOR \u00b6 1.a), and that, as of May 8, 2018, she owed collection debts totaling $26,422 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b-1.m). Under Guideline E, Applicant is alleged to have deliberately falsified her April 2016 Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations Processing (e-QIP) by responding negatively to inquiries concerning any financial delinquency on routine accounts in the last seven years (SOR \u00b6 2.a). In her SOR response, she admitted each of the alleged debts, except for a $71 cable service debt (SOR \u00b6 1.m). She indicated that the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.g-1.h are student loans under a repayment plan and that an $81 insurance debt (SOR \u00b6 1.l) had been paid.

Her \nfinances have been stressed by circumstances outside of her control, but she has yet to \ndemonstrate a sufficient track record of debt repayment. She falsified her SF 86 by denying \nany delinquent debts. Clearance is denied. \nStatement of the Case \n \n \nOn May 8, 2018, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility \n(DOD CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, detailing security concerns \nunder Guideline F, financial considerations, and Guideline E, personal conduct. The SOR \nexplained why the DOD CAF was unable to find it clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant or continue security clearance eligibility for her. The DOD CAF took the \naction under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); \nand the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to \n\n2 \n \nClassified Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AG) effective within the \nDOD on June 8, 2017. \n \nOn February 12, 2019, the DOD CAF informed Applicant that her initial response to \nthe SOR was not complete because she did not answer several of the allegations. On \nFebruary 21, 2019, Applicant submitted a notarized response to the SOR allegations in \nwhich she did not answer SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c and 1.h. She requested a decision based on the \nwritten record by an administrative judge from the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals \n(DOHA). In response to a February 27, 2019 email from the DOD CAF, Applicant \nanswered SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c and 1.h on March 1, 2019. On March 11, 2019, Applicant notarized \nan attachment submitted with her answer, and she again requested a decision without a \nhearing. \n \nOn March 11, 2019, the Government submitted a File of Relevant Material (FORM), \nconsisting of eight exhibits (Items 1-8). DOHA forwarded a copy of the FORM to Applicant \nand instructed her to respond within 30 days of receipt. Applicant received the FORM on \nMarch 25, 2019, and she submitted a timely response that was accepted without any \nobjections by the Government on April 25, 2019. On May 16, 2019, the case was assigned \nto me to determine whether it is clearly consistent with the interests of national security to \ngrant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. I received the case file on May 21, \n2019, and accepted Applicant\u2019s FORM response in the record as Applicant Exhibit (AE) A. \n \nEvidentiary Ruling \n \n \n  \n \nDepartment Counsel submitted, as Item 8, a summary report of a subject interview \nof Applicant conducted on June 22, 2016. The summary report was part of the DOD Report \nof Investigation (ROI) in Applicant\u2019s case. Under \u00b6 E3.1.20 of the Directive, a DOD \npersonnel background report of investigation may be received in evidence and considered \nwith an authenticating witness, provided it is otherwise admissible under the Federal Rules \nof Evidence. The summary report did not bear the authentication required for admissibility \nunder \u00b6 E3.1.20. \n  \nIn ISCR Case No. 16-03126 decided on January 24, 2018, the Appeal Board held \nthat it was not error for an administrative judge to admit and consider a summary of \npersonal subject interview where the applicant was placed on notice of her opportunity to \nobject to consideration of the summary; the applicant filed no objection to it; and there is no \nindication that the summary contained inaccurate information. In this case, Applicant was \nprovided a copy of the FORM and advised of her opportunity to submit objections or \nmaterial that she wanted the administrative judge to consider. In the FORM, Applicant was \nadvised as follows:  \n  \nIMPORTANT NOTICE TO APPLICANT: Your Enhanced Subject Interview \n(ESI) is being provided to the Administrative Judge for consideration as part \nof the record evidence in this case. In your response to this FORM, you can \ncomment on whether the PSI summary accurately reflects the information \nyou provided to the authorized OPM investigator(s) and you can make any \n\n3 \n \ncorrections, additions, deletions, and updates necessary to make the \nsummary clear and accurate. Alternatively, you can object on the ground that \nthe report is unauthenticated by a Government witness and the document \nmay not be considered as evidence. If no objections are raised in your \nresponse to the FORM, or if you do not respond to the FORM, the \nAdministrative Judge may determine that you have waived any objections to \nthe admissibility of the summary and may consider the summary as evidence \nin your case. \n  \n Concerning whether Applicant understood the meaning of authentication or the \nlegal consequences of waiver, Applicant\u2019s pro se status does not confer any due process \nrights or protections beyond those afforded her if she was represented by legal counsel. \nShe was advised in \u00b6 E3.1.4 of the Directive that she may request a hearing. In \u00b6 E3.1.15, \nshe was advised that she is responsible for presenting evidence to rebut, explain, or \nmitigate facts admitted by her or proven by Department Counsel and that she has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision. While the \nDirective does not specifically provide for a waiver of the authentication requirement, \nApplicant was placed on sufficient notice of her opportunity to object to the admissibility of \nthe interview summary report, to comment on the interview summary, and to make any \ncorrections, deletions, or updates to the information in the report. She did not file any \nobjections in her rebuttal (AE A) to the FORM. In the absence of any objections or \nindication that the interview summary report contains inaccurate information, I accepted \nItem 8 in evidence, subject to issues of relevance and materiality in light of the entire \nrecord. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nThe SOR alleges under Guideline F that Applicant filed a Chapter 13 bankruptcy in \nor about December 2008 that was dismissed in or about December 2008 (SOR \u00b6 1.a), and \nthat, as of May 8, 2018, she owed collection debts totaling $26,422 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b-1.m). \nUnder Guideline E, Applicant is alleged to have deliberately falsified her April 2016 \nElectronic Questionnaires for Investigations Processing (e-QIP) by responding negatively \nto inquiries concerning any financial delinquency on routine accounts in the last seven \nyears (SOR \u00b6 2.a). In her SOR response, she admitted each of the alleged debts, except \nfor a $71 cable service debt (SOR \u00b6 1.m). She indicated that the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and \n1.g-1.h are student loans under a repayment plan and that an $81 insurance debt (SOR \u00b6 \n1.l) had been paid. As for the alleged falsification of her security clearance application, \nApplicant responded, \u201cHit wrong button. I admit.\u201d In an attached statement, she listed \nseveral circumstances that compromised her finances. After considering the pleadings, \nexhibits, and transcript, I make the following findings of fact. \n \nApplicant is a 57-year-old defense contractor employee seeking a DOD security \nclearance. Separated from her husband since June 1997, Applicant has been in a \ncohabitant relationship since September 2014, with the exception of a few months in the \nspring of 2016. Applicant served on active duty in a branch of the United States military \n\n4 \n \nfrom March 1996 to December 1999. She has worked for her current employer since \nAugust 2012. (Items 3, 8.)  \n  \nApplicant earned an associate\u2019s degree at a technical institute from September \n2003 to August 2005. She pursued her bachelor\u2019s degree from August 2006 to June 2008, \nwhile working full time as a warehouse manager for a packaging company from March \n2005 to August 2012. Applicant obtained a combination of federal and private student \nloans to pay for her education. (Items 4-8.) \n \nApplicant became delinquent on her car and mortgage loan payments when her \nannual income was $33,676 in 2006 and $35,234 in 2007. (Items 4, 8.) In December 2008, \nApplicant filed a Chapter 13 bankruptcy petition. She owed $143,892 on her mortgage, and \nher home was valued at approximately $135,000. She owed $27,847 on a loan for a 2007 \nmodel-year vehicle. She listed, as unsecured nonpriority claims, $25,391 in consumer-\ncredit debts and $61,606 in student loan debts, including $8,287 in federal student loans. \nApplicant reported monthly net income of $680 after expenses. Her bankruptcy case was \nconfirmed in February 2009, with unsecured claims to receive 10% of what she owed. \nPayments of $632 per month were made by payroll deduction from February 2009 to July \n2009. In June 2009, Applicant moved to amend her bankruptcy to have all of her student \nloans paid outside her plan, and to increase her monthly payments under the plan to $720 \na month. Her pay was garnished at $332 every two weeks from mid-July 2009 through \nJune 2010. As of June 22, 2010, she had paid $12,695 under the bankruptcy plan. \nApplicant made no payments from July 2010 through September 2010, and a motion to \nshow cause for the $2,160 arrearage was filed in October 2010. In late December 27, \n2010, her Chapter 13 bankruptcy was dismissed for failure to file the necessary documents \nto convert her bankruptcy to a Chapter 7 bankruptcy. (Item 4.) Appellant provided no \nexplanation for her failure to see the bankruptcy process through to completion. \n \nIn August 2012, Applicant was involuntarily terminated from her employment as a \nwarehouse manager over how she handled a sexual harassment issue involving a \ntemporary employee. (Item 8.) Applicant began working for her current employer that \nmonth. (Item 3.) In early 2014, three of her private student loans, with balances of $13,297, \n$3,372, and $3,227, were charged off for nonpayment. As of March 2015, Applicant was \npast due on 11 other student loans totaling $40,727. (Item 5.) \n \nIn approximately February 2016, Applicant took another position with her employer, \nwhich required a relocation to her present locale. (Items 3, 8.) She took the position \nbecause of the higher pay. Her moving costs, which are not in evidence, were not covered \nby her employer. (Item 3.) In March 2016, Applicant obtained a car loan for $33,694, to be \nrepaid at $691 a month for 72 months. (Item 6.) \n \nApplicant completed and certified to the accuracy of a Questionnaire for National \nSecurity Positions (SF 86) incorporated within an e-QIP on April 14, 2016. Applicant \nresponded negatively to all of the financial record inquiries, including whether, in the past \nseven years, she had defaulted on any loan; had bills or debts turned over for collection; \nhad any account or credit card suspended, charged off, or cancelled for failing to pay as \n\n5 \n \nagreed; had her wages garnished for any reason; or she had been over 120 days \ndelinquent on any debts. She also answered \u201cNo\u201d to whether she was currently over 120 \ndays delinquent on any debt. (Item 3.) \n \nAs of November 16, 2016, Applicant had several delinquent accounts on her credit \nrecord. The three private student loans charged off in 2014 were in collection for $13,332 \n(SOR \u00b6 1.g), $3,235 (SOR \u00b6 1.b), and $3,381 (SOR \u00b6 1.h). Seven other debts were also in \ncollection: a $175 online education debt from January 2011 (SOR \u00b6 1.k); an $81 insurance \ndebt from February 2014 (SOR \u00b6 1.l); a $518 medical debt from November 2015 (SOR \u00b6 \n1.j); two debts from 2015 owed a former landlord of $2,344 (SOR \u00b6 1.c, likely duplicated in \nSOR \u00b6 1.i based on the available credit reports) and $875 (SOR \u00b6 1.d); a $73 insurance \ndebt placed in October 2016 (not alleged); and a $71 cable services debt from June 2015 \n(SOR \u00b6 1.m). The 11 student loans that had been more than five payments past due in the \nspring of 2015 had been transferred to a federal loan servicer in July 2015. As of October \n2016, the loan servicer was reporting an $81,212 balance in deferment. Applicant was \nmaking timely payments on five credit-card accounts with balances totaling $3,091 and on \nher car loan obtained in March 2016. (Item 6.) \n \nOn June 21, 2016, Applicant was interviewed by an authorized investigator for the \nOffice of Personnel Management (OPM). Applicant admitted that she should have \nanswered \u201cYes\u201d on her SF 86 to whether her wages had been garnished for any reason in \nthe last seven years. She explained that her wages had been garnished from July 2014 to \nJuly 2015 at $485 a month to catch up on her student loans. As for her failure to disclose \nany delinquencies on her SF 86, Applicant stated that she had not paid attention to the \nquestions on her SF 86. Applicant claimed to not recall any further details about her debts. \nHowever, when confronted about the charged-off student loan accounts, she indicated that \nthe accounts became delinquent because she forgot to apply for continued deferments. \nShe explained that she was making payments of $16.75 per month toward her \nconsolidated student loans. Applicant denied knowing about any of the outstanding \ncollection debts on her credit record, but indicated that she would examine her credit report \nand follow up with the creditors. When asked about her Chapter 13 bankruptcy, which was \noutside the scope of her SF 86, Applicant indicated that it was dismissed in December \n2010 after she made two years of payments to satisfy the terms. She described her \nfinancial situation as gradually improving and presently in great shape. (Item 8.) \n \nA check of Applicant\u2019s credit in March 2018 revealed new collection debts for cable \nservices from 2017 for $244 and $72 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e and 1.f). Her student loans with the \nfederal loan servicer were in forbearance, with a balance of $81,265, as she continued to \ntake on new debt. In April 2017, Applicant obtained an unsecured loan for $5,400 to be \nrepaid at $237 per month. In May 2017, she obtained a secured loan for $35,298, to be \nrepaid at $896 per month.  Applicant\u2019s credit report also revealed that she had opened \nseveral new credit card accounts since her subject interview. As of March 2018, she was \nmaking timely payments on $5,960 in credit card debts. (Item 5.) \n \nOn May 8, 2018, the DOD CAF issued an SOR to Applicant because of her \ndismissed bankruptcy and the collection debts on her record, including the three charged-\n\n6 \n \noff student loans, and because of her failure to disclose any past-due debts on her SF 86. \n(Item 1.)   In June 2018, Applicant refinanced an unsecured loan for $1,600, to be repaid at \n$311 a month. By November 2018, she was past due $643 on that loan; $237 on the April \n2017 unsecured loan; $322 on a credit card obtained in January 2016; and $170 on a \ncredit card obtained in March 2018. The outstanding balance of her deferred federal \nstudent loans had increased to $91,927. Applicant was making timely payments on the \n$35,298 secured loan (balance $29,936) and on 14 credit cards (balances totaling $8,609), \nincluding on a new credit card account opened in August 2018 with a $729 balance. She \nhad opened more than ten new credit card accounts since June 2016. (Item 7.) \n \nIn response to the SOR allegations, Applicant provided documentation from the \nentity collecting her charged-off student loans in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.g, and 1.h, which showed \nthat she entered into agreements in May 2018 for automatic repayment of the $3,235 loan \n(SOR \u00b6 1.b) at almost $81 a month for 24 months; of the $13,332 loan (SOR \u00b6 1.g) at $100 \nper month for six months; and of the $3,381 loan (SOR \u00b6 1.h) at $50 per month for six \nmonths. She provided proof of an $81 payment to satisfy the insurance debt in SOR \u00b61.l. \nApplicant explained that she never started taking classes at the university allegedly owed \n$175 (SOR \u00b6 1.k). She disputed the cable services debt in SOR \u00b6 1.m for $71, stating that \nshe never had service with the creditor. She attributed her debts to having to care for her \ndisabled sister since 1999, who receives only $7,000 in Social Security income a year; to \ntaking in her girlfriend\u2019s daughter and six-month old baby; to taking on car loan payments \nfor her girlfriend\u2019s daughter who then wrecked the car; and to incurring $3,000 in veterinary \nexpenses on credit for her dog in April 2018. She indicated, with no corroborating \ndocumentation, that she pays her sister\u2019s property taxes and electricity bills, and pays to \nrepair or replace items that break in her sister\u2019s home. Applicant explained that the \napartment debts were from early termination of her lease due to \u201cunfit living conditions,\u201d \nalthough she also claimed that she was let out of the lease. About her failure to list any \ndelinquencies on her April 2016 SF 86, Applicant stated: \n \nDid I click the wrong button about if I had debt etc., sure maybe. That was \nover two years ago. Those forms are so extensive you almost need an \nattorney with you to fill them out correctly. (Item 2.) \n \nIn the FORM, the Government argued that Applicant\u2019s explanation for the SF 86 \nomission of any delinquencies is not plausible, given her disclosure during her subject \ninterview that her wages had been garnished for her student loans. Additionally, if she hit \nthe wrong button, she had an opportunity to add additional comments on her SF 86 and did \nnot do so. \n \nIn her rebuttal to the FORM, Applicant indicated about her SF 86 response: \u201cPeople \nmake mistakes and yes, I guess I hit the wrong button on the form. I was at work at and \nprobably should have taken it home to complete.\u201d She asserted she did not know that she \n\u201cwould have to remember every facet of [her] life so that [she] could answer all these \nquestions about it.\u201d Applicant provided more information but not the expense figures for \nassistance provided for her sister, for whom she provides some food and pays her property \ntaxes, or for her girlfriend\u2019s daughter. Applicant indicated that she and her girlfriend used \n\n7 \n \ntheir vacation time and money to bring her girlfriend\u2019s daughter and child to live with them. \nThey pay the child\u2019s childcare expenses and have incurred an increase in food and utility \nexpenses. As the main financial provider in the household, Applicant has been paying on \nthe car loan for the vehicle purchased for her girlfriend\u2019s daughter, who had begun working \nbut then became pregnant, and with two children cannot take over the payments. Applicant \nsubmits that she will likely lose her job if her clearance eligibility is denied, which would \ncause a financial hardship, not only for her, but also for those financially dependent on her \nincome. Applicant indicated that she has just recently been able to save some money, \nwhich has alleviated some of the stress of living from paycheck to paycheck.  (AE A.) \n \nApplicant had enjoyed her work with her employer before her employer apparently \nreassigned her to other duties. She indicated that she spent three years improving \nprocesses at work and acquired her bachelor\u2019s degree and \u201ca green belt in Six Sigma\u201d for \nher employment. (AE A.)  \n \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion the Executive \nBranch has in regulating access to information pertaining to national security,  emphasizing \nthat \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, \nthe administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be considered in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. These guidelines \nare not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, \nthese guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative \nprocess. The administrative judge\u2019s overall adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative \njudge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, \nfavorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence \nto establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant \nis responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \n\n8 \n \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation about potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7 of EO 10865 \nprovides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section \n3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information). \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \n \n \nThe security concerns about financial considerations are articulated in AG \u00b6 18: \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness \nto abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or \nsensitive information. Financial distress can also be caused or exacerbated \nby, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other issues of personnel security \nconcern such as excessive gambling, mental health conditions, substance \nmisuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . . \n \n \nThe Appeal Board explained the scope and rationale for the financial considerations \nsecurity concern in ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) (citation omitted) \nas follows: \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money in satisfaction of \nhis or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the totality of an \napplicant\u2019s financial history and circumstances. The Judge must consider \npertinent evidence regarding the applicant\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other \nqualities essential to protecting the national secrets as well as the \nvulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive presumes a \nnexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines and an \napplicant\u2019s security eligibility. \n \nAvailable credit reports and Applicant\u2019s admissions establish a record of consumer \ncredit delinquencies that raise Guideline F security concerns under AG \u00b6 19(a), \u201cinability to \nsatisfy debts,\u201d and AG \u00b6 19(c), \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d Applicant \nfiled for a Chapter 13 bankruptcy in December 2008 that was dismissed two years later \nwhen she did not follow through on the paperwork required to convert her bankruptcy to a \nChapter 7. While she is credited with paying $12,695 under the plan from February 2009 \n\n9 \n \nthrough June 2010 through payroll deduction, she was $2,160 in arrears as of October \n2010 when the trustee filed a motion to show cause for failure to make her payments. She \nprovided no explanation for her failure to see the bankruptcy process through to \ncompletion. \n   \nThe consumer credit delinquencies in the SOR were incurred after her bankruptcy. \nThree of the collection debts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.g, and 1.h) are student loans that were \ncharged off in 2014. Two of the collection debts, SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c (duplicated in SOR \u00b6 1.i) and \n1.d resulted from her premature termination of an apartment lease. Three debts are unpaid \ncable balances (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e, 1.f, and 1.m); one debt is owed to an online university (SOR \u00b6 \n1.k); and one debt is medical (SOR \u00b6 1.j). An $81 insurance debt (SOR \u00b6 1.l) in collection \nwas paid in mid-May 2018, after the SOR was issued. \n \nApplicant has the burden of establishing mitigation. One or more of the following \nconditions under AG \u00b6 20 may apply: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under \nsuch circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem from a \nlegitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit counseling service, \nand there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under \ncontrol; \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a) has little applicability. Applicant\u2019s bankruptcy was dismissed almost a \ndecade ago, but it is still relevant because of the negative financial implications raised by \nher failure to complete the process. Some of her post-bankruptcy delinquencies were \nincurred before 2015. The university debt is from 2011 (SOR \u00b6 1.k), the student loans in \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.g, and 1.h were charged off in spring 2014, and the insurance debt (SOR \u00b6 \n1.l) was placed for collection in early 2014. The apartment (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c and 1.d) and \nmedical debts (SOR \u00b6 1.j) were assigned for collection in August and November 2015. The \n\n10 \n \ncable services debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e, 1.f, and 1.m were placed for collection within the last \nfour years. While it is unclear when some of the accounts first became delinquent, the \ndebts were not paid as of the date of the SOR. A debt that became delinquent several \nyears ago is still considered recent because \u201can applicant\u2019s ongoing, unpaid debts \nevidence a continuing course of conduct and, therefore, can be viewed as recent for \npurposes of the Guideline F mitigating conditions.\u201d ISCR Case No. 15-06532 at 3 (App. Bd. \nFeb. 16, 2017) (citing ISCR Case No. 15-01690 at 2 (App. Bd. Sept. 13, 2016)). \n \n \nApplicant attributes her financial problems to several circumstances that could fall \nwithin AG \u00b6 20(b). She indicated that she has helped her disabled sister since 1999, by \nproviding some food, paying her property taxes and electric bills, and paying for repairing \nor replacing items for her sister when they break. Applicant and her cohabitant girlfriend \ntook in the latter\u2019s daughter and baby, who needed a place to live. They incurred additional \ncosts for the baby\u2019s care, and then the daughter had or is about to have a second child. \nApplicant took on a loan for a vehicle for her girlfriend\u2019s daughter, who needed \ntransportation once she found a job. The decisions to care for her sister and girlfriend\u2019s \ndaughter were within her control, but Applicant had no control over the girlfriend\u2019s daughter \nbecoming pregnant with her second child. \n \nEven if Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to \ncircumstances outside of her control, I have to consider whether Applicant acted in a \nreasonable manner when dealing with her financial difficulties. See ISCR Case No. 05-\n11366 at 4, n.9 (App. Bd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. \nMay 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-\n13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). A component is whether Applicant maintained \ncontact with her creditors and attempted to negotiate partial payments to keep debts \ncurrent. In that regard, she asserted during her June 2016 subject interview that her wages \nwere garnished for one year to bring her student loans (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.g, and 1.h) current \nin July 2015. She indicated that she was making $16.75 monthly payments toward a \nconsolidated student loan. She presented no documentation of efforts to address the \nstudent loans before May 22, 2018, and the balances of the student loans at that time had \nnot changed from October 2016. Applicant was placed on notice of the other collection \ndebts on her credit record during her June 2016 interview. She had opened more than 10 \nnew credit card accounts since completing her SF 86 in April 2016, as most if not all of the \ncollection debts in the SOR went unaddressed. The latest secured loan on Applicant\u2019s \ncredit record was opened in May 2017 for $35,298. Applicant has not credibly explained \nwhy she needed to take on such a sizeable loan with a repayment term of $896 a month. \nShe provided no details about her income or expenses, so it is difficult to conclude that she \nhas made sound financial decisions. \n \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 20(c) and 20(d) have only minimal applicability. Applicant is credited with \nsatisfying the $81 insurance debt in May 2018 (SOR \u00b6 1.l), and a favorable finding is \nreturned as to that debt.  Although her repayment arrangements for the student loans in \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.g, and 1.h. are viewed favorably, it would be premature to apply either AG \u00b6 \n20(c) or AG \u00b6 20(d) to the student loans without any proof of compliance with the \nrepayment terms and lacking any current repayment plans. Assuming the payments were \n\n11 \n \nmade as promised, she would have reduced the balances only by $1,941 on the $3,235 \nloan, by $600 on the $13,332 loan, and by $300 on the $3,381 loan. Without evidence of \ncurrent repayment plans for those debts, it cannot reasonably be concluded that her \nfinancial problems are under control. Moreover, she has made no payments, and has no \npayment arrangements in place for other debts in the SOR.  \n \n \nRegarding AG \u00b6 20(e), Applicant disputed the $71 cable services collection debt \n(SOR \u00b6 1.m) on the basis that she never had service with the company. While a credit \nreport can normally meet the burden of establishing a debt, it is noted that the debt does \nnot appear on the March 2018 and November 2018 credit reports. Applicant\u2019s 2018 credit \nreports include the $2,094 debt in SOR \u00b6 1.c but not the $2,344 debt in SOR \u00b6 1.i, which \nappears to be the balance of the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.c reported by a collection entity. \nApplicant presented no documentation to show that the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.i and 1.m are \nnot valid, but enough doubt exists as to whether she owes those balances. For that reason, \nI find for Applicant as to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.i and 1.m.  \n \n \nThe Appeal Board has held that an applicant is not required to establish that she \nhas paid off each debt in the SOR, or even that the first debts paid be those in the SOR. \nSee ISCR Case No. 07-06482 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008). Applicant has demonstrated that \nshe can handle some financial accounts responsibly, as evidenced by her timely payments \non several credit card accounts. However, available information does not enable a \npredictive judgment that Applicant\u2019s financial situation is sufficiently under control that she \ncan be counted on to address her delinquent accounts. Circumstances keep coming up \nthat have apparently prevented her from addressing her delinquencies. Within the past few \nyears, she has opened a dozen credit card accounts and taken on new debt while showing \nlittle progress on resolving the SOR debts. Loans obtained in April 2017 and June 2018 \nwere past due as of November 2018. She owes approximately $91,927 in deferred federal \nstudent loan debt on which she will have to make payments at some point. The Appeal \nBoard recently reiterated in ADP Case No. 17-0063 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2018) that \u201can \napplicant must demonstrate a plan for debt repayment, accompanied by concomitant \nconduct, that is, conduct that evidences a serious intent to resolve the debts.\u201d  Too many \nunanswered questions exist about her present financial situation to conclude that her \nfinancial problems no longer present a security risk. The financial considerations security \nconcerns are not sufficiently mitigated. \n \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \n \n \nThe security concern about personal conduct is articulated in AG \u00b6 15: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions about \nan individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or \nsensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to cooperate or provide \ntruthful and candid answers during national security investigations or \nadjudicative processes. The following will normally result in an unfavorable \n\n12 \n \nnational security eligibility determination, security clearance action, or \ncancellation of further processing for national security eligibility: \n \n(a) refusal, or failure without reasonable cause, to undergo or cooperate with \nsecurity processing, including but not limited to meeting with a security \ninvestigator for subject interview, completing security forms or releases, \ncooperation with medical or psychological evaluation, or polygraph \nexamination, if authorized and required; and \n \n(b) refusal to provide full, frank, and truthful answers to lawful questions of \ninvestigators, security officials, or other official representatives in connection \nwith a personnel security or trustworthiness determination. \n \nApplicant certified to the accuracy of an April 2016 SF 86 on which she responded \nnegatively to all of the financial record inquiries, including whether, in the past seven years, \nshe had defaulted on any loan; had bills or debts turned over for collection; had any \naccount or credit card suspended, charged off, or cancelled for failing to pay as agreed; \nhad her wages garnished for any reason; or she had been over 120 days delinquent on \nany debts. Applicant responded \u201cI admit\u201d to the alleged deliberate falsification, but she then \nstated in explanation that she \u201cmaybe hit the wrong button;\u201d and that [t]hose forms are so \nextensive you almost need an attorney with you to fill them out correctly.\u201d In rebuttal to the \nFORM, Applicant stated, \u201cPeople make mistakes and yes, I guess I hit the wrong button on \nthe form.\u201d She explained that she completed the form at work when she should have taken \nit home, but did not elaborate further as to why this would have made a difference. She \nalso claimed that she did not know that she would have to recall \u201cevery little facet\u201d of her \nlife. \n \nThe Appeal Board has repeatedly held that, to establish a falsification, it is not \nenough merely to demonstrate that an applicant\u2019s answers were not true. To raise security \nconcerns under Guideline E, the answers must be deliberately false. In analyzing an \napplicant\u2019s intent, the administrative judge must consider an applicant\u2019s answers in light of \nthe record as a whole. See, e.g. ISCR Case No. 14-05005 (App. Bd. Sep. 15, 2017); ISCR \nCase No. 10-04821 (App. Bd. May 21, 2012). When interviewed by an OPM investigator in \nJune 2016, Applicant gave yet another explanation for her failure to list any delinquencies \non her SF 86. She indicated that she had not paid attention to all the questions.  She then \nadmitted that her wages had been garnished at $485 per month from July 2014 to July \n2015 to catch up on her student loans (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.g, and 1.h). She claimed to recall no \nother details about those student loans, but when confronted, she indicated that the \naccounts became delinquent because she had forgotten to apply for continued deferments \nand could not make the monthly payments required to keep them current. She asserted \nthat the loans were currently in good standing, and that she was paying $16.75 per month \ntoward a consolidated balance. Applicant denied knowing about the collection debts on her \ncredit record when confronted with the adverse information on her credit report. Even \nassuming that Applicant lacked knowledge about the collection accounts or that her \nstudent loans were in collection status, she knew she had defaulted on three student loans \nwithin seven years preceding her SF 86. Moreover, although she was not specifically \n\n13 \n \nalleged in the SOR to have falsified the SF 86 question concerning any wage garnishments \nin the last seven years, Applicant should have answered \u201cYes\u201d to that question as well. The \nevidence supports a reasonable finding that Applicant deliberately falsified her SF 86. \nDisqualifying condition AG \u00b6 16(a) applies. It provides: \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \naward benefits or status, determine national security eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \n \n \nNone of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 17 fully apply. AG \u00b6 17(a), \u201cthe \nindividual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, concealment, or \nfalsification before being confronted with the facts,\u201d warrants some consideration because \nApplicant admitted during her interview in June 2016 that her wages had been garnished \nfor her student loans. However, she needed prompting before she provided details of the \ngarnishments and the reason for her default of her student loans. There is no evidence that \nher negative response to the SF 86 financial record inquiries was on the advice of legal \ncounsel or person authorized to provide guidance concerning the security clearance \nprocess, so AG \u00b6 17(b) does not apply. That mitigating condition states: \n \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was caused \nor significantly contributed to by advice of legal counsel or of a person with \nprofessional responsibilities for advising or instructing the individual \nspecifically concerning security processes. Upon being made aware of the \nrequirement to cooperate or provide the information, the individual \ncooperated fully and truthfully. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 17(c) is not pertinent. By falsely certifying that she had no loan defaults in the \nlast seven years, no garnishments in the last seven years, and no delinquencies over 120 \ndays in the last seven years, Applicant violated 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001 of the United States \nCode. Falsification of an SF 86 is too serious for mitigation under AG \u00b6 17(c), and it raises \nconsiderable doubts about whether her representations can be relied on. AG \u00b6 17(c) \nstates: \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is so \ninfrequent or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is unlikely \nto recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment. \n \n \nPerhaps more significant from a trustworthiness standpoint going forward, \nApplicant\u2019s ongoing failure to acknowledge the intentional nature of her SF 86 falsifications \nreflects a lack of reform. AG \u00b6 17(d) requires a meaningful acknowledgement of behavior \nwithout excuses or justifications. It is not enough in reform for Applicant to indicate that she \nmay have hit the wrong button, or that she should have taken the form home to complete. \nAs noted by the Government, Applicant could have provided information about her \n\n14 \n \ndelinquencies in the section for additional comments. In her rebuttal to the SOR, Applicant \nstated that she did not know that she would have to remember \u201cevery little facet\u201d of her life. \nShe does not demonstrate that she understands the importance of full candor, which is \nrequired of the security clearance applicant. The personal conduct concerns are not \nmitigated under AG \u00b6 17(d), which requires: \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling to \nchange the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the stressors, \ncircumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, unreliable, or \nother inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of her conduct and \nall relevant circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative process factors in AG \u00b6 2(d): \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances \nsurrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the \nfrequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at \nthe time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) \nthe presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral \nchanges; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \n \n \nSome of the adjudicative process factors were addressed under Guidelines F and E, \nbut some warrant additional comment. Applicant is credited with pursuing her college \ndegree to obtain a better job and then a green belt in Six Sigma to contribute more \neffectively to her employer. There is no evidence that she is disloyal to the United States or \nto her employer, but the security clearance determination is not a comment on an \nindividual\u2019s loyalty or patriotism. Nor is it made as punishment for specific past conduct. \nThe security clearance assessment is a reasonable and careful evaluation of an applicant\u2019s \ncircumstances and whether they cast doubt upon her judgment, self-control, and other \ncharacteristics essential to protecting national security information. Applicant asks that \nconsideration be paid to the negative impacts denial of security clearance eligibility would \nhave on her and on those persons who depend on her income. The Appeal Board recently \nreaffirmed in ISCR Case No. 17-03971 (App. Bd. Mar. 15, 2019) that the consequences \nthat arise from an unfavorable clearance decision are not relevant considerations in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance. For the reasons noted above, \nApplicant has raised enough doubts about her judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness to \nwhere I am unable to conclude that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant \nher security clearance eligibility at this time. \n\n15 \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.h: \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.i:  \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.j-1.k: \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.l-1.m: \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n________________________ \nElizabeth M. Matchinski \nAdministrative Judge \n \n",

(HE 2) Specifically, the SOR \nset forth security concerns arising under the financial considerations guideline. \n03/04/2019\n\n \n2 \n                                         \n \nOn September 20, 2018, Applicant responded to the SOR, and he requested a \nhearing. (HE 3) On October 18, 2018, Department Counsel was ready to proceed. On \nOctober 22, 2018, the case was assigned to me. On October 25, 2018, the parties agreed \non a hearing date of November 26, 2018. On November 19, 2018, the Defense Office of \nHearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing, setting the hearing for \nNovember 26, 2018. (HE 1) The hearing was held as scheduled using video \nteleconference.  \n  \nDepartment Counsel offered five exhibits; Applicant did not offer any exhibits; there \nwere no objections to the documents; and they were admitted into evidence. (Tr. 16-17; \nGE 1-5) On December 6, 2018, DOHA received a copy of the transcript of the hearing \n(Tr.). The record initially closed on January 28, 2019, and I granted an extension to \nFebruary 15, 2019. (Tr. 47; Applicant Exhibit (AE) A) On February 27, 2019, Applicant \nprovided a 61-page telefax (includes cover sheet). (AE A)   \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s SOR response, he admitted the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through \n1.f, and 1.j. (HE 3) He also provided extenuating and mitigating information. Applicant\u2019s \nadmissions are accepted as findings of fact.  \n \nApplicant is 57 years old, and he has been employed by various defense \ncontractors since 1996. (Tr. 6, 8; GE 1) He is currently a logistician. (Tr. 8) He has no \nperiods of unemployment over the previous 22 years. (Tr. 8) In 1980, he graduated from \nhigh school, and in 2008, he received an associate\u2019s degree. (Tr. 6) He served in the \nMarine Corps from 1980 to 1996. (Tr. 7) He received a medical discharge. (Tr. 7) He \nreceived a 60 percent disability rating from the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). (Tr. \n7-8) He has been married four times, and his most recent marriage was in 2012. (Tr. 8) \nHis three children were born in 1980, 1981, and 1990. (Tr. 9) \n \nFinancial Considerations \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s annual salary is $92,000. (Tr. 18) He has held a security clearance \nsince 1983. (Tr. 19-20) In 2013, his spouse lost her job. (Tr. 21) Her salary was about \n$40,000 annually. (Tr. 21) From 2014 to 2016, she had 14 surgeries to her leg, and \nApplicant had health insurance. (Tr. 22) His spouse was unable to work, and they fell \nbehind on their mortgage and some of their other bills. (Tr. 22) Starting in mid-2017, his \nspouse began receiving about $1,000 monthly in disability payments. (Tr. 23, 43) When \nher disability payments started, she also received about $32,000 in disability pay as a \nlump sum, and those funds were used to pay some debts. (Tr. 43) She has not been \nemployed outside their home since 2014. (Tr. 23)  \n \nIn 2017, Applicant spent $1,700 to purchase furniture. (Tr. 25) In 2018, Applicant \npurchased two used vehicles and financed $19,000 for one and $17,000 for the other \nvehicle. (Tr. 24) In 2018, he borrowed $2,000 against his motorcycle to pay their rent. (Tr. \n25) When Applicant\u2019s spouse received the $32,000 lump sum disability payment in mid-\n\n \n3 \n                                         \n \n2017, he did not use the funds from the lump sum disability payment to pay his delinquent \ntax debt because the tax debt was \u201cout of sight, out of mind\u201d at that time. (Tr. 43) \n \nApplicant\u2019s SOR alleges the following financial issues: \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.a alleges Applicant failed to timely file his federal income tax returns for \ntax years 2014 through 2016. When he completed his January 9, 2017 SCA, he explained \nthat he had not filed his tax returns for tax years 2014, 2015, and 2016, and he intended \nto file them in 2017. (GE 1) Actually, he failed to timely file his federal income tax returns \nfor tax years 2010, 2011, 2012, 2014, 2015, and 2017. (Tr. 28; AE A) His federal income \ntax returns were timely filed for tax years 2013 and 2016. (AE A) Currently, he does not \nowe federal taxes for tax years 2010 through 2013, and he resolved the federal income \ntax debt for those four years through a payment plan in 2014. (Tr. 34) He owes about \n$6,000 of federal income taxes for tax years 2015 and 2016, and he does not have a \npayment plan to resolve this tax debt. (Tr. 33-34; AE A) His tax refunds for tax years 2017 \nand 2018 will be sufficient to fully resolve his delinquent federal income tax debt.

(AE A at 23) \n \n3 Applicant provided an IRS Wage and Income Transcript and not an IRS Account Transcript for \ntax year 2011. (AE B at 26-27) His IRS Wage and Income Transcript shows income information and some \ndeductions. It does not show when his federal income tax return was filed or whether any additional taxes \nwere owed after his tax return was filed. \n \n4 See note 3, supra. \n \n5 Tax debt for tax year 2013 was paid on March 17, 2017. (AE A at 31) \n \n6 Applicant\u2019s federal income tax account balance owed for tax year 2015 is $1,889. (AE A at 38) \n \n7 Applicant\u2019s federal income tax account balance owed for tax year 2016 is $4,391. (AE A at 50) \n\n \n4 \n                                         \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.b alleges Applicant failed to timely file his state income tax returns for tax \nyears 2010 through 2013. He said he filed his state tax returns for tax years 2010 through \n2013, in 2014. (Tr. 26) He filed his state tax returns for tax years 2014, 2015, and 2016, \nin 2017. (Tr. 26-27) At the time of his hearing, he had not yet filed his state tax returns for \ntax year 2017. (Tr. 27) He may have owed about $1,500 for tax years 2010 through 2013, \nand he paid that debt. (Tr. 32) He started a payment plan for tax years 2014, 2015, and \n2016; however, he was unable to complete it because of medical bills for his spouse\u2019s \nsurgeries. (Tr. 32) He believed he had a state tax lien for about $1,100, and he paid it. \n(Tr. 31, 33) \n \nApplicant said he did not have the funds to pay his taxes, and he decided to \u201cwait \nthree years and then take care of it.\u201d (Tr. 29) He acknowledged this was not the correct \napproach for handling taxes. (Tr. 29) He promised to call the state tax authority the day \nafter his hearing to request supporting documentation and to provide the information to \nDepartment Counsel. (Tr. 31, 33) He was unsure about what tax documentation he had \nat home. (Tr. 35) \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.c alleges Applicant had a delinquent mortgage account that went into \nforeclosure. In 2007, he purchased a residence and financed about $154,000. (Tr. 36) \nThe purchase of the residence was financed with a loan from the Department of Veterans \nAffairs (VA),8 and repayment was guaranteed by the VA. (Tr. 37-38; GE 2-4) In July 2015, \nhe began to fall behind on his mortgage payments. (Tr. 36) In February 2016, he stopped \nmaking payments. (Tr. 36) His credit reports show a zero balance, and the debt is \nresolved.  \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.d alleges an account placed for collection for $740. Applicant said the \ndebt was in a payment plan, and Applicant agreed to provide proof of the payment plan \nand payments after his hearing. (Tr. 38) \n \n                                            \n8 The VA loan guarantee is as follows: \u201cFor loans between $45,000 and $144,000, the minimum \nguaranty amount is $22,500, with a maximum guaranty, of up to 40 percent of the loan up to $36,000, \nsubject to the amount of entitlement a veteran has available.\u201d As to whether the VA loss on a loan must be \nrepaid, the VA explains:   \n \nMust the loan be repaid? \n \nYes. A VA guaranteed loan is not a gift. It must be repaid, just as you must repay any \nmoney you borrow. The VA guaranty, which protects the lender against loss, encourages \nthe lender to make a loan with terms favorable to the veteran. But if you fail to make the \npayments you agreed to make, you may lose your home through foreclosure, and you and \nyour family would probably lose all the time and money you had invested in it. If the lender \ndoes take a loss, VA must pay the guaranty to the lender, and the amount paid by VA must \nbe repaid by you. If your loan closed on or after January 1, 1990, you will owe the \nGovernment in the event of a default only if there was fraud, misrepresentation, or bad faith \non \nyour \npart. \nFactsheet \nVAP \n26-4 \nis \navailable \non \nthe \nVA \nwebsite \nat \nhttp://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&frm=1&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0CD4QFj\nAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.benefits.va.gov%2Fhomeloans%2Fdocs%2Fvap 26-4 online version.pdf&ei \n=q4QbU zSCaST0QH0mIDwAg& usg=AF QjCNFv0-ay6SGFdfcDFlaE7aENpSq0cA. \n\n \n5 \n                                         \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.e alleges an account placed for collection for $465. Applicant said the \ndebt was in a payment plan, and Applicant agreed to provide proof of the payment plan \nand payments after his hearing. (Tr. 39) \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.f alleges a medical debt placed for collection for $150. The medical debt \ndoes not appear on his most recent credit report, and Applicant is credited with resolving \nthis debt. (Tr. 39) \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.g alleges a judgment filed against Applicant in 2013, for $3,752. Court \nrecords indicate, on May 27, 2015, Applicant paid this debt in full. (Tr. 40, 44; SOR \nresponse at 3) This debt is resolved. \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.h alleges a judgment filed against Applicant in 2011, for $815. The debt \nwas satisfied in January 2014. (SOR response at 5) This debt is resolved. \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.i allege a judgment filed against Applicant in 2011, for $13,967. On \nSeptember 24, 2018, the creditor wrote this debt was paid. (Tr. 44; SOR response at 6) \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.j alleges a telecommunications debt placed for collection for $1,309. \nApplicant said the debt was in a payment plan, and Applicant agreed to provide proof of \nthe payment plan and payments after his hearing. (Tr. 40-41) As of February 15, 2019, \nhe had made payments of $523 towards this debt. (AE A at 7-9) \n \nAfter the hearing, I sent Applicant an email asking for payment plans and payments \non the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d, 1.e, and 1.j. (Tr. 41; AE B) He provided proof of a payment \nplan to address the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.j. (AE A at 7-9)   \n \nI also requested: (1) IRS tax transcripts for tax years 2010 to 2016; (2) proof of \npayments or status of state taxes for tax years 2010 to 2016; and (3) front and back of \nfirst page of state tax returns for tax years 2010 to 2016. (Tr. 41-42; AE B)9 I suggested \nhe provide any other documentation relevant to his case. (Tr. 41-42; 47-48; AE A) The \ninitial suspense was January 28, 2019, and I gave him an extension until February 27, \n2019. (AE B) \n \nApplicant requested information from the state tax authority about his taxes \nverbally, and he made a written request on February 25, 2019. (AE A at 11)   \n \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \n                                            \n9 An Applicant\u2019s failure to provide requested, available tax documentation, including IRS-generated \nfederal income tax transcripts, can undermine mitigation of tax debts. See ISCR Case No. 16-02322 at 4 \n(App. Bd. Mar. 14, 2018). \n\n \n6 \n                                         \n \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The President \nhas authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicant\u2019s eligibility for \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended.  \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not \ninflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about \nthe person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Clearance \ndecisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \nThus, nothing should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole or \nin part, on any express or implied determination about applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or \npatriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the \nPresident and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.  \n \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 \n(App. Bd. May 2, 1996). \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his or her security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of \ndisproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b). \n \n \n\n \n7 \n                                         \n \nAnalysis \n \nFinancial Considerations \n \nAG \u00b6 18 articulates the security concern relating to financial problems:  \n \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended \nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.  \n \nAG \u00b6 19 provides three disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern \nand may be disqualifying in this case: \u201c(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts\u201d; \u201c(c) \na history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d; and \u201c(g) failure to file annual Federal, state, \nor local income tax returns as required . . . .\u201d Applicant\u2019s SOR alleges, and he admitted \nthat he failed to timely file his federal tax returns for tax years 2014 and 2015. SOR \u00b6 1.a \nalleges his federal income tax return for tax year 2016 was not timely filed; however, he \nis credited with timely filing his federal income tax return for tax year 2016. SOR \u00b6 1.b \nalleges and the record establishes that he failed to timely file his state tax returns for tax \nyears 2010, 2011 and 2012. . SOR \u00b6 1.b alleges his state income tax return for tax year \n2013 was not timely filed; however, he is credited with timely filing his state income tax \nreturn for tax year 2013. Several other debts became delinquent and judgments were \nentered against him. The Government established the disqualifying conditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n19(a), 19(c), and 19(g) requiring additional inquiry about the possible applicability of \nmitigating conditions. \n \nSeven mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially applicable: \n  \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or \nthere are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under \ncontrol; \n \n\n \n8 \n                                         \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts;10   \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue;  \n \n(f) the affluence resulted from a legal source of income; and \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n \nThe Appeal Board concisely explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for proving the \napplicability of mitigating conditions as follows:  \n \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of \na security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government \npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the \napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The \nstandard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in \nEgan, supra. \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access \nto classified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nDirective, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 2(b).  \n \nISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013).  \n \nNo mitigating conditions fully apply to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b; however, Applicant \npresented some important mitigating information. His spouse became unemployed, and \nshe had medical debts resulting in a significant, unexpected reduction in his family\u2019s \n                                            \n10The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a \u201cgood faith\u201d effort to repay overdue \ncreditors or otherwise resolve debts:  \n \nIn order to qualify for application of [the \u201cgood faith\u201d mitigating condition], an applicant must \npresent evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or some \nother good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant\u2019s debts. The Directive does not \ndefine the term \u201cgood-faith.\u201d However, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-\nfaith \u201crequires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, \nhonesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.\u201d Accordingly, an applicant must do more than \nmerely show that he or she relied on a legally available option (such as bankruptcy) in \norder to claim the benefit of [the \u201cgood faith\u201d mitigating condition]. \n \n(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2004) (quoting \nISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 4, 2001)).   \n \n\n \n9 \n                                         \n \nincome. These unusual circumstances were beyond Applicant\u2019s control and caused or \ncontributed to Applicant\u2019s financial problems. He established payment plans for several \ndebts; he paid three large judgments; the VA resolved his mortgage debt; his remaining \nunresolved delinquent debts total about $1,500, and are relatively insignificant. He is \ncredited with mitigation of the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c through 1.j.    \n \nApplicant failed to timely file his federal income tax returns for tax years 2010, \n2011, 2012, 2014, 2015, and 2017, and state tax returns for those same six tax years.11 \nThe DOHA Appeal Board has observed: \n \nFailure to file tax returns suggests that an applicant has a problem with \ncomplying with well-established governmental rules and systems. Voluntary \ncompliance with such rules and systems is essential for protecting classified \ninformation. ISCR Case No. 01-05340 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 20, 2002). As we \nhave noted in the past, a clearance adjudication is not directed at collecting \ndebts. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 07-08049 at 5 (App. Bd. Jul. 22, 2008). By \nthe same token, neither is it directed toward inducing an applicant to file tax \nreturns. Rather, it is a proceeding aimed at evaluating an applicant\u2019s \njudgment and reliability. Id. A person who fails repeatedly to fulfill his or her \nlegal obligations does not demonstrate the high degree of good judgment \nand reliability required of those granted access to classified information. \nSee, e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015). See \nCafeteria & Restaurant Workers Union Local 473 v. McElroy, 284 F.2d 173, \n183 (D.C. Cir. 1960), aff\u2019d, 367 U.S. 886 (1961). \n \nISCR Case No. 14-04437 at 3 (App. Bd.

The Appeal Board \nclarified that even in instances where an \u201c[a]pplicant has purportedly corrected [the \napplicant\u2019s] federal tax problem, and the fact that [applicant] is now motivated to prevent \nsuch problems in the future, does not preclude careful consideration of [a]pplicant\u2019s \nsecurity worthiness in light of [applicant\u2019s] longstanding prior behavior evidencing \n                                            \n11 Applicant\u2019s SOR does not allege that he failed to timely file his federal tax returns for tax years \n2010, 2011, 2012, and 2017, and state tax returns for tax years 2014, 2015, and 2017. In ISCR Case No. \n03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006), the Appeal Board listed five circumstances in which conduct not \nalleged in an SOR may be considered stating: \n  \n(a) to assess an applicant\u2019s credibility; (b) to evaluate an applicant\u2019s evidence of \nextenuation, mitigation, or changed circumstances; (c) to consider whether an applicant \nhas demonstrated successful rehabilitation; (d) to decide whether a particular provision of \nthe Adjudicative Guidelines is applicable; or (e) to provide evidence for whole person \nanalysis under Directive Section 6.3.  \n \nId.

June 15, 2016) (characterizing \u201cno harm, no foul\u201d \napproach to an Applicant\u2019s course of conduct and employed an \u201call\u2019s well that ends well\u201d \nanalysis as inadequate to support approval of access to classified information with focus \non timing of filing of tax returns after receipt of the SOR).   \n \nApplicant repeatedly failed to timely file his tax returns. The magnitude of his state \ntax debt is unclear. Financial considerations security concerns are not mitigated.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(a) were \naddressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional comment.  \n \nApplicant is 57 years old, and he has been employed by various defense \ncontractors since 1996. He is currently a logistician. He has no periods of unemployment \nover the previous 22 years. In 2008, he received an associate\u2019s degree. He served in the \nMarine Corps from 1980 to 1996, and he received a medical discharge. He received a 60 \npercent disability rating from the VA.  \n \nWhen Applicant\u2019s spouse was unable to work outside their home because of \nmedical problems, the family income was significantly reduced and debts became \ndelinquent. Applicant is credited with the reduction of his delinquent debts by paying three \njudgments. The VA paid his mortgage debt. He has shown enough financial progress to \nmitigate all of his non-tax delinquent SOR debts.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s history of failing to timely his federal tax returns for tax years 2010, \n2011, 2012, 2014, 2015, and 2017, and state tax returns for those same six tax years, \nraises unresolved financial considerations security concerns. He may owe state income \n\n \n11 \n                                         \n \ntaxes.12 When an issue involving taxes arises, an administrative judge is required to \nconsider how long an applicant waits to file their tax returns, whether the IRS or a state \ngenerates the tax returns, and how long the applicant waits after a tax debt arises to begin \nand complete making payments.13 The primary problem here is that Applicant has \nrepeatedly been late filing his tax returns. He did not provide a good reason for not timely \nfiling his federal and state income tax returns.  \n \n I have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Egan, Exec. Or. 10865, the \nDirective, and the AGs, to the facts and circumstances in the context of the whole person. \nFinancial considerations and personal conduct security concerns are not mitigated. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n  \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:   \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT  \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a and 1.b:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.c through 1.j: \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n                                            \n12 See ISCR Case No. 14-03358 at 3, 5 (App. Bd.

July 7, 2016) (reversing grant of security clearance \nand stating, \u201cHis delay in taking action to resolve his tax deficiency for years and then taking action only \nafter his security clearance was in jeopardy undercuts a determination that Applicant has rehabilitated \nhimself and does not reflect the voluntary compliance of rules and regulations expected of someone \nentrusted with the nation\u2019s secrets.\u201d); ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 2-6 (App. Bd.

Oct. 30, 2014) (reversing grant of a security clearance, noting not all tax returns filed, and \ninsufficient discussion of Applicant\u2019s efforts to resolve tax liens). More recently, in ISCR Case No. 14-05476 \n(App. Bd. Mar. 25, 2016) the Appeal Board reversed a grant of a security clearance for a retired E-9 and \ncited applicant\u2019s failure to timely file state tax returns for tax years 2010 through 2013 and federal returns \nfor tax years 2010 through 2012. Before his hearing, he filed his tax returns and paid his tax debts except \nfor $13,000, which was in an established payment plan. The Appeal Board highlighted his annual income \nof over $200,000 and discounted his non-tax expenses, contributions to DOD, and spouse\u2019s medical \nproblems. The Appeal Board emphasized \u201cthe allegations regarding his failure to file tax returns in the first \nplace stating, it is well settled that failure to file tax returns suggest that an applicant has a problem with \ncomplying with well-established government rules and systems. Voluntary compliance with such rules and \nsystems is essential for protecting classified information.\u201d Id. at 5 (citing ISCR Case No. 01-05340 at 3 \n(App. Bd.

Myers, Esq. \n05/23/2019 \n______________ \n \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nHESS, Stephanie C., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant mitigated the potential security concerns raised by her sporadic \nmarijuana use over a five month period in 2015 while holding a security clearance and by \nher failure to disclose the uses on her security clearance application in 2016. Eligibility for \naccess to classified information is granted. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (e-QIP) on August 9, 2016. \nOn August 27, 2018, the Department of Defense (DOD) sent her a Statement of Reasons \n(SOR), alleging security concerns under Guideline E (Personal Conduct). The DOD acted \nunder Executive Order (Ex. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \n(Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) implemented by DOD on June 8, 2017.  \n  \nApplicant submitted her Answer to the SOR on September 26, 2018, requesting a \nhearing before an administrative judge. Department Counsel was ready to proceed on \nDecember 20, 2018, and the case was assigned to me on January 30, 2019. On April 3, \n\n2 \n \n2019, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) notified Applicant through \ncounsel that the hearing was scheduled for April 23, 2019. I convened the hearing as \nscheduled. Government Exhibits (GX) 1 and 2 were admitted into evidence without \nobjection. Applicant testified and Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AX) A through G were admitted \nwithout objection. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on May 2, 2019. \n  \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant is a 34-year-old database administrator currently employed by a defense \ncontractor since August 2016. She earned her associate\u2019s degree in 2007 and her \nbachelor\u2019s degree in information systems technologies in 2009. She was first granted a \nsecret security clearance in October 2009. (GX 1; Tr. 22.)  \n \nUnder Guideline E, the SOR alleges that Applicant used marijuana with varying \nfrequency between May and October 2015 while holding a security clearance. The SOR \nalso alleges that Applicant failed to disclose this use as required on her August 2016 e-\nQIP. Applicant admits the marijuana use while holding a clearance, but denies the two \nallegations of intentional falsification of her e-QIP. Applicant\u2019s admissions are \nincorporated in my findings of fact. \n \nFrom April 2015 until February 2016, Applicant was working as a senior database \nengineer. Although Applicant\u2019s security clearance was still active, her position did not \nrequire her to have a security clearance and she did not have access to classified \ninformation. In May 2015, Applicant began dating her former boyfriend. Applicant\u2019s former \nboyfriend used marijuana recreationally. He was aware that Applicant had never \npreviously used marijuana or any illegal drug, but pressured her to smoke marijuana with \nhim. After declining several offers, Applicant succumbed to what she described as peer \npressure, and smoked marijuana with her former boyfriend. She did not actively consider \nthat her marijuana use could have a negative impact on her security clearance \nworthiness. (Tr. 17-19.)  \n \nBetween May and October 2015, Applicant smoked marijuana approximately four \nor five times, or roughly once a month. The marijuana made her feel relaxed and sleepy. \n(GX 2.) She broke up with her former boyfriend in October 2015 and has not used \nmarijuana or any illegal drug since that time. (Tr. 18-21.) She has no intention of future \nuse and has submitted a signed statement of intent to never use illegal drugs again with \nthe understanding that any involvement with illegal drugs is grounds for revocation of her \nsecurity eligibility. (AX G.) Applicant does not have any contact with her former boyfriend \nor associate with anybody who uses illegal drugs. She voluntarily participated in an eight-\nhour drug and alcohol awareness class in April 2019, in which she learned how to avoid \nsituations where illegal drugs are being used and how to make better decisions about her \nenvironment. (Tr. 18-21; Tr. 30-32.) Applicant voluntarily disclosed her marijuana use \nduring her personal subject interview (PSI) prior to being confronted. (Tr. 25-26.) \n \nApplicant did not disclose the fact that she had used marijuana in the prior seven \nyears or that she had used marijuana while holding a security clearance on her e-QIP as \n\n3 \n \nrequired. Applicant volunteered during her PSI that she was embarrassed about her \nmarijuana use and had not told anyone about it. She also stated that she did not believe \nshe had to affirmatively state that she had used marijuana while holding a security \nclearance because she did not use marijuana while working in the secured position. \nDuring her PSI, Applicant said she should have disclosed her marijuana use on her e-\nQIP, and that her failure to do so was a mistake that she needed to rectify. (Tr. 26-27.) \n \nApplicant\u2019s friend since 2016 is aware of the SOR issues and states that Applicant \nis professional and trustworthy and should be allowed to maintain her security clearance. \nA friend of Applicant since elementary school, who was also aware of the SOR \nallegations, states that Applicant\u2019s clearance should be continued because she  is loyal, \nhonest, and dedicated to supporting the United States. Applicant has been highly \nrecommended for employment and for a security clearance by former supervisors and \ncoworkers since 2009. (AX C.) Applicant is remorseful for her conduct and understands \nwhy it raised security concerns. She is committed to increasing her knowledge and \nprofessionalism and has received certifications in her field. She is dedicated to her job, \nstating that her career is her top priority. (Tr. 55-57.) Applicant was sincere, candid, and \nhumble while testifying. \n \nPolicies \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended.  \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant\u2019s meeting the \ncriteria contained in the AG. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, \nrecognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies these \nguidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available and reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \n\n4 \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. Or. \n10865 \u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the \napplicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense \nhave established for issuing a clearance. \n \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 92-1106 at 3, \n1993 WL 545051 at *3 (App. Bd. Oct. 7, 1993).  \n \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \n \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).  \n \nAnalysis \n \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 15:  \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. . . .  \n \nThe following disqualifying condition is applicable to the concerns raised by \nApplicant\u2019s use of marijuana while holding a security clearance: \n \nAG \u00b6 16(c):  credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas \nthat is not sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-person \nassessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack \nof candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other \n\n5 \n \ncharacteristics indicating that the individual may not properly safeguard \nclassified or sensitive information. \n \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \n \nAG \u00b6 17(c): the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the \nbehavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances \nthat it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's \nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n \nAG \u00b6 17(d): the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained \ncounseling to change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate \nthe stressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to \nrecur; and \n \nAG \u00b6 17(g): association with persons involved in criminal activities was \nunwitting, has ceased, or occurred under such circumstances that do not \ncast doubt upon the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, judgment, \nwillingness to comply with rules and regulations. \n \n \nApplicant used marijuana on four or five occasions in 2015 with a former boyfriend \nwith whom she no longer has any contact. She held an active security clearance at the \ntime of her marijuana use, but was not working in a cleared position. She did not realize \nthat using marijuana while holding a clearance, despite whether or not she was working \nin a cleared position could have an adverse impact on her security clearance eligibility. \nShe never previously used marijuana, nor has she since. Afterwards, Applicant chose \nnever to use marijuana again. Applicant willingly participated in a drug and alcohol \nawareness program where she learned how to make better choices about her \nenvironments. She does not have a social circle that includes people who use illegal \nsubstances.  \n \nApplicant recognizes that her decision to use marijuana in general, and specifically \nwhile holding a clearance, was a mistake. She accepts responsibility for her actions and \nis remorseful for her conduct. She has provided a written statement in which she \nacknowledges the use, states her intent of no future use of any illegal drugs, and \nrecognizes that any such use will result in the loss of her security clearance.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s last use of marijuana in 2015 is not recent. The Directive does not \ndefine \u201crecent,\u201d and there is no \u201cbright-line\u201d definition of what constitutes \u201crecent\u201d conduct. \nISCR Case No. 03-02374 at 4 (App. Bd. Jan. 26, 2006). The Judge is required to evaluate \nthe record evidence as a whole and reach a reasonable conclusion as to the recency of \nan applicant's conduct. ISCR Case No. 03- 02374 at 4 (App. Bd. Jan. 26, 2006).  \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s use of marijuana while holding a security clearance places a heavy \nburden on her to establish mitigation. After considering the record as a whole, specifically, \nthe circumstances surrounding Applicant\u2019s limited use of marijuana, the length of time \n\n6 \n \nthat is passed since that limited use, and Applicant\u2019s remorse for her actions, I conclude \nthat Applicant has met her heavy burden of proof and persuasion. Applicant\u2019s marijuana \nuse happened under circumstances that are unlikely to recur, and does not cast doubt on \nher current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. AG \u00b6\u00b6 17(c), 17(d), and 17(g) \napply.  \n \nThe following disqualifying condition is applicable to the concerns raised by \nApplicant\u2019s failure to disclose her marijuana use while holding a security clearance on her \ne-QIP as required: \n \nAG \u00b6 16(a): deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant \nfacts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, \nor similar form used to conduct investigations . . . [or] determine national \nsecurity eligibility. \n \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \n \nAG \u00b6 17(a); the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the \nomission, concealment, or falsification before being confronted with the \nfacts; and \n \nAG \u00b6 17(c): the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the \nbehavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances \nthat it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's \nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. \n \n \nApplicant failed to list her four to five uses of marijuana in her 2015 on her 2016 e-\nQIP because she was embarrassed. She did not list for marijuana use while holding a \nsecurity clearance because she had not been working in a cleared position and \nerroneously thought that she was not required to do so. However, Applicant recognized \nthat she was required to disclose this use during her background investigation and \nvolunteered information about her use during her PSI. Her falsification was not recent and \nis unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on her current reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment. AG \u00b6\u00b6 17(a) and 17(c) apply. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2, the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-person concept, \nan administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by \nconsidering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances. An \nadministrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 \n2(d).  \n \n \n\n7 \n \n \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline E and in my whole-person \nanalysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were addressed under that guideline, but I \nhave also considered the following: \n \n \nApplicant is highly regarded and trusted by her long-time friends and former \nsupervisors and coworkers. Her several uses of marijuana while holding a security \nclearance place a heavy burden on Applicant to establish mitigation. Additionally, her \ninitial failure to be forthcoming about her use raises concerns about her trustworthiness. \nAfter considering the record as a whole, specifically, the circumstances surrounding \nApplicant\u2019s brief period of marijuana use, the length of time that is passed since that use, \nApplicant\u2019s remorse for her actions, and her current clear understanding of her obligation \nfor truthfulness, I conclude that she has met her heavy burden of proof and persuasion. \nApplicant\u2019s testimony was credible, humble, and sincere.  \n \n \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline E, and \nevaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has \nmitigated the security concerns raised by her past conduct. Accordingly, I conclude she \nhas carried her burden of showing that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to \ngrant her eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nAs required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, I make the following \nformal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \n \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline E (Personal Conduct):  \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a through 1.d: \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nI conclude that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s \neligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n \nStephanie C. Hess \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Applicant did not present sufficient evidence to explain, \nextenuate, or mitigate the trustworthiness concern stemming from his problematic \nfinancial condition. Accordingly, this case is decided against Applicant.  \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant completed and submitted a Questionnaire for National Security Positions \n(SF 86 format) on February 8, 2017.  On June 13, 2018, after reviewing the application \nand the information gathered during a background investigation, the Department of \nDefense Consolidated Adjudications Facility sent Applicant a statement of reasons \n(SOR), detailing trustworthiness concerns under Guideline F for financial considerations.1 \n1 This action was taken under Executive Order (E.O.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry (February 20, 1960), as amended, as well as Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive). In \naddition, the Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information (AG), \neffective within the Defense Department on June 8, 2017, apply here.    \n01/04/2019\n\n2 \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on July 8, 2018, and requested a decision based on the \nwritten record without a hearing.   \n \nOn August 7, 2018, Department Counsel submitted a file of relevant and material \ninformation (FORM).2  Included in the FORM were six items of evidence. Items 1 and 2 \nare the SOR and Applicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR, respectively. Since those are the \npleadings, they are already part of the record.3 Items 3 through 5 are admitted without \nobjection. Item 6 is discussed below. The FORM was mailed to Applicant on August 8, \n2018, who received it August 12, 2018. Applicant\u2019s response to the FORM was due on \nSeptember 26, 2018. Applicant did not respond to the FORM. The case was assigned to \nme on December 10, 2018.  \n \nProcedural Matters \n \n \nThe FORM included Item 6, which is a report of investigation (ROI) summarizing \nApplicant\u2019s interview that took place during the June 2018 background investigation. The \nROI is not authenticated as required under \u00b6 E3.1.20 of the Directive.4 Department \nCounsel\u2019s written brief includes a footnote advising Applicant that the summary was not \nauthenticated and that failure to object may constitute a waiver of the authentication \nrequirement. The footnote is prominently prefaced with a bolded, upper case notice to \nApplicant and flagging for Applicant the importance of the footnote, which then explains \nthe concepts of authentication and waiver. Nevertheless, I am not persuaded that a pro \nse applicant\u2019s failure to respond to the FORM, which response is optional, equates to a \nknowing and voluntary waiver of the authentication requirement. The record does not \ndemonstrate that Applicant understood the concepts of authentication, waiver, and \nadmissibility. It also does not demonstrate that he understood the implications of waiving \nan objection to the admissibility of the ROI. Accordingly, Item 6 is inadmissible, and I have \nnot considered the information in the ROI.    \n  \nFindings of Fact \n \n \n Applicant is 45 years old and married with two biological children and a grown \nstep-child. He has an associate\u2019s degree, and since November 2015, Applicant has been \nemployed by a federal contractor.

Judge Ra\u2019anan raises a number of pertinent questions \nabout using an unauthenticated ROI in a non-hearing case with a pro se applicant.). \n \n\n3 \n \nsponsor is the Defense Health Agency. Eligibility is necessary because a job with his \nsponsor would involve access to sensitive but unclassified information.5 \n \n \nUnder Guideline F, the SOR alleged 13 delinquent debts totaling about $46,928, \nmade up of $32,919 in consumer debt and about $14,032 in student loan debt.6 Applicant \nadmitted all of those debts.7 Four attachments to Applicant\u2019s answer documented that he \nhad resolved four SOR debts. Those debts are SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1. i, j, k, and l ($548, $430, $410, \nand $350, respectively, totaling $1,738).8  \n \nThe status of Applicant\u2019s delinquent student loans warrants discussion, as that \nstatus is unclear. SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1. c, d, and g alleged three delinquent student loans ($6,841, \n5,809, and $1,362, respectively, totaling $14,012). One of the attachments to Applicant\u2019s \nanswer notified Applicant on March 12, 2018, that his student loans had been assigned \nto a collection agency. That attachment set forth a plan whereby Applicant would arrange \nfor automatic withdrawals of $5.00 per month to be made beginning March 15, 2018, \nthrough November 15, 2018. As of March 12, 2018, the current balance (including \ninterest, fees, and costs) was $28,250.9 It is unclear which of the student loans this \narrangement addressed, or whether this was a consolidation of those three loans. In \naddition, Applicant submitted no documentation showing that he adhered to that plan.  \n \nPutting aside the student loans and the four SOR debts that Applicant has resolved \n(totaling $15,750), there remains $31,178 of unresolved delinquent debts. Those debts \nremain unresolved as recently as April 3, 2018.10  \n \nPolicies \n \nPositions designated as ADP I and ADP II are classified as \u201csensitive positions.\u201d  \n(Regulation \u00b6\u00b6 C3.1.2.1.1.7 and C3.1.2.1.2.3.)  \u201cThe standard that must be met for . . . \nassignment to sensitive duties is that, based on all available information, the person\u2019s \nloyalty, reliability, and trustworthiness are such that . . . assigning the person to sensitive \nduties is clearly consistent with the interests of national security.\u201d (See Regulation \u00b6 \nC6.1.1.1.) The Deputy Under Secretary of Defense (Counterintelligence and Security) \nMemorandum, dated November 19, 2004, indicates trustworthiness adjudications will \napply to cases forwarded to DOHA by the Defense Security Service and Office of \nPersonnel Management. Department of Defense contractor personnel are afforded the \n                                                          \n5 Item 3. \n \n6 Item 1.  \n \n7 Item 2.  \n \n8 AE B through E. \n  \n9 AE A.

Item 5.  \n \n10 Item 5.  \n\n4 \n \nright to the procedures contained in the Directive before any final unfavorable access \ndetermination may be made. (See Regulation \u00b6 C8.2.1.)   \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a public trust position, the \nadministrative judge must consider the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the AG. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of \nhuman behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the \nadjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, \nimpartial and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a \nconscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d \nThe administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the \nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to [sensitive] \ninformation will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable trustworthiness decision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nsensitive information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard sensitive information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of sensitive information. \n \nDiscussion \n \nGuideline F \u2013 Financial Considerations  \n \n \nUnder Guideline F for financial considerations,11 the suitability of an applicant may \nbe questioned or put into doubt when that applicant has a history of excessive \nindebtedness or financial problems or difficulties. The overall concern is: \n \n           Failure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to \nabide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect . . .  sensitive \n                                                          \n11 AG \u00b6\u00b6 18, 19, and 20 (setting forth the concern and the disqualifying and mitigating conditions). \n \n\n5 \n \ninformation. Financial distress can also be caused or exacerbated by, and thus \ncan be a possible indicator of, other issues of personnel security concern such as \nexcessive gambling, mental health conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse \nor dependence. An individual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of \nhaving to engage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a security \nconcern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including espionage.12 \n \n \nThe concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise sensitive information to obtain money or something else of value. It \nencompasses concerns about a person\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other important \nqualities. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding sensitive information. \n \n \nIn analyzing the facts of this case, I considered the following disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions or factors:  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 19(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n \nAG \u00b6 19(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations;  \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on \nthe individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected \nmedical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear victimization by \npredatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the individual acted responsibly \nunder the circumstances; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n \n \nThe evidence supports a conclusion that Applicant has had a problematic financial \ncondition sufficient to raise a trustworthiness concern under Guideline F.  AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) \nand (c) apply. A trustworthiness adjudication is not a proceeding aimed at collecting an \napplicant's debts. Rather, it is a proceeding aimed at evaluating an applicant's judgment, \n                                                          \n12 AG \u00b6 18. \n \n\n6 \n \nreliability, and trustworthiness.13 The next inquiry is whether any of the mitigating \nconditions apply.  \n \n \nApplicant has resolved four of the debts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1. i, j, k, and l). They have, \ntherefore, been mitigated under AG \u00b6 20(d). As to the remaining unresolved debts, there \nis no evidence that they were infrequent, or were caused so long ago, that they were \ncaused by conditions largely beyond Applicant\u2019s control, or that he has received credit \ncounseling. Therefore, AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), (b), (c), and (d) do not apply.  \n \n \nThe record creates doubt about Applicant\u2019s trustworthiness, good judgment, and \nability to protect sensitive information. In reaching this conclusion, I weighed the evidence \nas a whole and considered if the favorable evidence outweighed the unfavorable \nevidence or vice versa. I also gave due consideration to the whole-person concept.14 \nAccordingly, I conclude that Applicant did not meet his ultimate burden of persuasion to \nshow that it is clearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant him eligibility \nfor access to sensitive information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nThe formal findings on the SOR allegations are: \n \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n    \n   Against Applicant  \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a.- h.:             \n \n   Against Applicant \n              \nSubparagraphs 1.i.- l.:                      \n   For Applicant  \n \nSubparagraph 1.m.    \n \n \n    Against Applicant                \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of the record as a whole, it is not clearly consistent with the interests of \nnational security to grant Applicant eligibility for access to sensitive information.  \n \n \n \nPhilip J.

No documents \nwere received. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he admitted the two delinquent student loans \n(SOR 1.c, $9,158 and SOR 1.d, $7,415), an unpaid state tax warrant (SOR 1.e, $1,805), \nand an unpaid judgement (SOR 1.f, $1,493). He denied the remaining allegations. After \na thorough review of the pleadings, testimony, and exhibits, I make the following \nadditional findings of fact. \n \nApplicant is a 46-year-old aircraft avionics technician who has worked for a \ndefense contractor since July 2015. (Tr. 19, 20) He is seeking to obtain a security \nclearance.2 (Ex. 1) From May 1991 through June 2011, he honorably served in the U.S. \nNavy. One of his assignment was as a Navy recruiter. (Tr. 20) After retiring, he obtained \na job paying $17 an hour, which was a decrease in monthly income of approximately \n$1,500. (Tr. 41) His current monthly budget shows a total income of $4,648, which \nincludes his $1,260 Navy retirement pay, and total expenses of $4,531. (Ex. B) His \novertime pay is not reflected in his budget because it is not a guaranteed monthly amount. \n(Tr. 50) His annual household income is approximately $78,000. (Tr. 60)  \n \n \nApplicant is married and has three children ages 21, 21, and 18. (Ex. 1) Two of his \nchildren are in college, and the third graduated high school a couple months following the \nhearing. (Tr. 46) His daughter pays for her tuition with student loans and his son is \nattending community college. Both live at home, and he provides them with funds for food \nand gas. (Tr. 53)  \n \nOn Applicant\u2019s September 2016 Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations \nProcessing (e-QIP), he indicated he had failed to file tax returns for tax years 2010, 2011, \n2012, and 2013. (Ex. 1) He did have taxes withheld from his wages during those years. \n(Tr. 31) For tax year 2015, he asserted he had filed a request for an extension. (Ex. 1) He \nindicated the student loans were \u201cin default and [the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) was] \ngoing to garnish any returns. I thought I was going to be able to catch up and get my \nreturn[s]. I was unable to and lost track of time.\u201d (Ex. 1) He stated he had hired a law firm \n                                            \n2 In 1995, Applicant obtained a DoD secret clearance and in February 1991, he received a secret clearance \nafter an Expanded National Agency Check (ENAC). (Ex. 2)  \n\n   \n \n3 \n \n \nin May 2016 to assist him with his unpaid taxes. (Ex. 1) No other delinquent accounts or \nunpaid judgment were listed on his e-QIP.  \n \nAt the time Applicant retired from the Navy, his wife stopped working due to \nfibromyalgia. (Ex. 2, Tr. 24) Additionally, she had been working in the housing financial \nindustry, which took a serious downturn in 2011. (Tr. 39) He pays $200 monthly medical \nbills for his wife\u2019s treatment with the remainder paid by TRICARE. (Tr. 25) She receives \n$1,000 monthly in disability payments, which he did not include as income in his budget \nbecause he considered that income to be her income. (Tr. 39) \n \n  \nOn December 7, 2017, Applicant had an enhanced subject interview. (Ex. 2) He \nlisted his current financial status as \u201cpoor.\u201d (Ex. 2) In his household, his wife manages \ntheir finances. (Tr. 66) He discovered a number of delinquent accounts when his wife \nobtained a copy of their credit report. He was unaware of the delinquent accounts at the \ntime he completed his e-QIP. He attributed his financial problems to retiring from the \nmilitary. While in the military his salary and cost-of-living adjustments covered his \nexpenses. When he left the military, paying his debts became harder. He said he now \nhad a good paying job and planned to get his finances in order. He expressed a \nwillingness to pay his debts. (Ex. 2)  \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s interview, he stated he did not know why he failed to file his Federal \nand state income tax returns. He stated he meant to file each year, but he was busy, and \nthe time slipped away. He did not know how much he owed in taxes and penalties. (Ex. \n2) He admitted owing a state tax warrant (SOR 1.e, $1,805) entered against him in 2017. \n(SOR Response) In October 2018, the state filed a $1,297 state tax warrant. (Ex. 5) The \nrecord does not reflect if there are two separate warrants issued for different tax years or \njust one tax warrant that duplicated the same tax debt. In his December 2017 interview, \nhe said he planned to immediately contact his attorney to determine how to satisfy the \ntax debt. (Ex. 2) He contacted his attorney in July 2016. (Tr. 29) At the hearing, Applicant \nstated he did not know what had been filed on his behalf. (Tr. 33)  \n \nAt the hearing, Applicant stated his 2009 federal tax refund had been intercepted \nand applied to his student loan obligation. He said he did not file his 2010 returns because \nhe hoped to get his student loan obligation in order so his tax refunds would not be \nintercepted and again applied to his student loan debt. (Tr. 27) As an active duty military \nmember, his home state did not require him to file a state return for 2010 because he was \nserving outside of his home state. (Tr. 28)  \n \nA December 2018 letter from his attorney stated he had \u201calready brought \n[Applicant] into filing compliance and are actively working toward resolving the liabilities \nowed to the IRS.\u201d (Ex. A) No documentation showing copies of returns or other evidence \nof filing accompanied the letter. The letter made no reference to state tax return filings, \nbut Applicant asserted his attorney was also filing his state tax returns. (Tr. 36) At the \nhearing, he stated he was still trying to determine how much he owed in taxes and could \nnot remember receiving any correspondence from the IRS. (Tr. 22, 29) He stated the IRS \n\n   \n \n4 \n \n \nwas seeking approximately $20,000 for delinquent taxes. (Tr. 32) However, he believes \nhe had overpaid his taxes for the years in question and believes he will receive a refund \nonce everything is determined. (Tr. 32) His attorney had advised him not to make any \npayments until the amount of his tax obligation was determined. (Tr. 36, 47) Based on his \nmonthly budget, he anticipates he will be making $200 monthly for tax repayment plan. \nHe currently makes no payments. (Ex. B, Tr. 24, Tr. 55) \n \nApplicant asserted he had filed his 2016 and 2017 tax returns in a timely manner \nand expected to receive an $859 Federal tax refund for 2017, and he owed $288 for 2017 \nstate taxes and $400 for his 2016 state taxes. (Tr. 35, 37) No state tax was taken from \nhis Navy retirement pay resulting in the state tax owed. (Tr. 37, 63) At the hearing, he \npresented a copy of his 2017 Federal income tax return, which was returned to him. He \nwas asked to submit copies of his 2016 and 2017 returns following the hearing. (Tr. 61, \n62, 64, 66) No documents were received following the hearing. He said he had a copy of \nhis 2016 return in his vehicle. He said he attempted to get copies of his tax transcripts, \nbut was requested to provide a credit card number to obtain the transcripts. (Tr. 35) Since \nhe had ended his use of his credit cards in 2008, he was unable to provide the requested \ncredit card number and, therefore, was unable to get copies of his tax transcripts. (Tr. 35, \n64) No copies of tax returns, tax transcripts, or correspondence with the IRS were \nreceived following the hearing.  \n \n \nIn 1998 and 1999, Applicant obtained student loans totaling $18,000. (Ex. 2) He is \nfour classes short of obtaining his bachelor\u2019s degree and has not taken any college class \nin the past ten years. He asserted, but provided no documentation, that the loans had \nbeen in deferment status on and off over the years. His last payment was made in 2017. \nIn his interview, he said he stopped paying due to an \u201coversight,\u201d not further explained, \nand planned to start making payments as soon as possible. (Ex. 2) His 2009 Federal \nincome tax refund had been intercepted and applied to his student loan obligation. (Tr.23) \nThe record does not reflect the amount applied to his student loan obligation.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s October 2016 credit report lists two education collection accounts \n(SOR 1.c, $9,158 and SOR 1.d, $7,415). (Ex. 3) His March 2018 credit report lists the two \ncollection accounts with the comment \u201cPaid Collection; Student Loan.\u201d However, the \ncredit report also lists a \u201cStudent Loan Assigned to the Government.\u201d (Ex. 4) His budget \nanticipates a $200 monthly payment on a loan, which Applicant says is for his student \nloan payment. (Ex. B, Tr. 24) he admits owing approximately $18,000 on his student loans \nand is currently making no payments on his student loans. (Tr. 45) Once his taxes are \nstraightened out. He intends to start a $200 monthly allotment for his student loans. (Tr. \n45) He does not know who currently holds his student loans. (Tr. 56)  \n \nDuring Applicant\u2019s interview, he stated he had no knowledge concerning a number \nof delinquent debts including the following SOR debts: SOR 1.a ($429), SOR 1.b ($300), \nand SOR 1.g ($981). (Ex. 2) He did acknowledge a 2012 judgment (SOR 1.f, $1,493) \nagainst him by the owners of his former residence. His rent was $1,200 and he believed \nthe amount of the judgment represented one month\u2019s rent plus late fees and expenses. \n\n   \n \n5 \n \n \n(Ex. 2) He did not respond to the notice of hearing he received because he thought it only \nconcerned eviction and not for unpaid rent and additional amounts. (Tr. 48, 67) At the \ntime of his interview, he stated he intended to look into the matter and, if responsible, to \nsatisfy the debt as soon as possible. At the hearing, he stated he intended to address the \njudgment because he had a better understanding of what was happening. (Tr. 48)  \n \nWhen asked about the delinquent accounts, Applicant could not provide the dates \nthe debts were incurred, why they were incurred, when they became delinquent, any \naction taken to satisfy the debts, and he did not know the creditors\u2019 telephone numbers \nor addresses. (Ex. 2) He intended to look into the accounts and begin to satisfy them one \nat a time. \n \nIn 2013, Applicant\u2019s vehicle was repossessed and he received a refund because \nhis equity in the vehicle exceeded what was owed on the loan. (Tr. 41) In 2011, his home \nwent into foreclosure. (Tr. 40) His mortgage company requested no payments following \nthe foreclosure. He asserts he made payment on the debt in SOR 1.a ($420) on \nNovember 20 and December 20, which paid the debt. (Ex. C, Tr. 42) He received no \ncorrespondence from the creditor indicating the debt was paid, but showed funds were \nwithdrawn from his bank account. (Ex. B, Tr. 43) Applicant disputes the $300 debt (SOR \n1.c), which was for cable equipment. He had decided to end his cable service and \nreturned the equipment. (Tr. 44) The television provider says the equipment was not \nreceived. He also denies the $981 (SOR 1.g) collection account for telephone service. \n(Tr. 48) He asserts this was for equipment that he returned and the creditor asserts was \nnot received. (Tr. 48) He has had no contact with the telephone company for two or three \nyears. (Tr. 49) \n \nApplicant asserted that over the last couple of months he had started climbing out \nof the financial difficulties incurred following his retirement from the Navy. (Tr. 46) He is \nnot receiving any correspondence from creditors regarding delinquent accounts. (Tr. 52) \nHe has approximately $30,000 in his 401(k) retirement plan. (Tr. 52) He has no car \npayments. (Tr. 65) He has not received any financial counseling. (Tr. 56)  \n \n \nApplicant was asked to provide copies of his tax returns. (Tr. 60) He informed the \nrecord was being held open to allow him to supplement the record with additional \ndocumentation of addressing his delinquent obligations. (Tr. 5, 18, 74) No documentation \nwas received.  \n \n Policies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which must be considered in evaluating \nan applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \n\n   \n \n6 \n \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), \nthe adjudication process is an examination of a sufficient period and a careful weight of a \nnumber of variables of an individual\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the \nindividual is an acceptable security risk. This is known as the whole-person concept.  \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination of the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \n \nAdjudicative Guideline (AG) \u00b6 18 articulates the security concerns relating to \nfinancial problems: \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \n\n   \n \n7 \n \n \nprotect classified or sensitive information . . . An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. \n \nAdditionally, an individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, negligent, or careless in properly handling and safeguarding \nclassified information. Behaving responsibly or irresponsibly in one aspect of life provides \nan indication of how a person may behave in other aspects of life. \n \nA person\u2019s relationship with his creditors is a private matter until evidence is \nuncovered demonstrating an inability or unwillingness to repay debts under agreed upon \nterms. Absent evidence of strong extenuating or mitigating circumstances, an applicant \nwith a history of serious or recurring financial difficulties is in a position of risk that is \ninconsistent with holding a security clearance. An applicant is not required to be debt free, \nbut is required to manage his finances to meet his financial obligations. \n \nApplicant failed to file his 2010 through 2015 Federal income tax returns and his \n2011 through 2015 state income tax returns in a timely manner, was delinquent on his \nstudent loans, had an unpaid judgment, had an unpaid state tax warrant, and three \ndelinquent accounts in collection. AG \u00b6 19 includes four disqualifying conditions that could \nraise a security concern any may be disqualifying in this case: \u201c(a) inability to satisfy \ndebts;\u201d \u201c(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so;\u201d \u201c(c) a history \nof not meeting financial obligations;\u201d and \u201c(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual \nFederal, state, or local income tax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local \nincome tax as required.\u201d \n \nThe Government\u2019s evidence and Applicant\u2019s own admissions raise security \nconcerns under AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), 19(b), 19(c), and 19(f). The burden shifted to Applicant to \nproduce evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the security concerns. \n(Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15) An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, and \nthe burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. (See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 \nat 5 (App. Bd. September 22, 2005)). Applicant has the burden of presenting evidence of \nexplanation, extenuation, or mitigation to overcome the financial considerations security \nconcerns.  \n \nThe Appeal Board concisely explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for proving the \napplicability of mitigating conditions as follows:  \n \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of \na security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government \npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the \napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The \nstandard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in \n\n   \n \n8 \n \n \nEgan, supra. \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access \nto classified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nDirective, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 2(b).  \n \nISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013).  \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially applicable: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem from \na legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit counseling \nservice, and there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved \nor is under control; \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue; and \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s 2009 Federal income tax refund was intercepted and applied to his \nstudent loan debt. In 2010, he did not file his Federal income tax return hoping to correct \nthe problem with his student loans so his tax refunds would no longer be intercepted. He \nmade the decision not to file for fear he would not get his refund. His state of residence \ndid not require him to make a 2010 state income tax return. He asserted he meant to file \nhis returns, but time slipped away from him. He hired an attorney to assist him in filing his \ndelinquent returns. A letter from his attorney stated Applicant is now in compliance with \nhis tax filing requirements. However, this letter is the only indication Applicant\u2019s delinquent \ntax returns have been filed. No other documentation was presented showing compliance.  \n \n\n   \n \n9 \n \n \nApplicant hopes to reach a repayment agreement with the IRS and state tax \nauthority. However, intentions to pay debts in the future are not a substitution for a track \nrecord of debt repayment or other responsible approaches. See ISCR Case No. 11-14570 \nat 3 (App. Bd. Oct 23, 2013) He does not know how much Federal and state tax is owed. \nHe stated the IRS was seeking $20,000 in delinquent taxes, but he believes he will be \nentitled to a refund of taxes paid. He provided no documentation supporting this belief. \nHe acknowledged a $1,805 state tax warrant issued against him in 2017, and he has a \n$1,297 state tax warrant. It is unclear from the record if the two warrants involve the same \ntax debt for the same tax years. He had taxes withheld from his wages, but has made no \nadditional tax payments. His attorney told him not to make payments until a repayment \narrangements have been made.  \n \nThere is no documentary evidence Applicant has contacted his creditors or has \nestablished repayment agreements with his creditors. An applicant is not required to be \ndebt-free or to develop a plan for paying off all debts immediately or simultaneously, but \nhe is required to act responsibly given his circumstances and develop a reasonable plan \nfor repayment, accompanied by \u201cconcomitant conduct,\u201d that is, actions which evidence a \nserious intent to effectuate the plan. See ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 3 (App. Bd. May \n21, 2008).  \n \nApplicant obtained student loans in 1998 and 1999 to attend college. He is not \ncurrently making payments on the $18,000 delinquency on those loans. He has not made \npayment on the judgment obtained by the rental company. He paid one of the collection \ndebts, but the two other collection debts have not been paid. \n \nApplicant was repeatedly informed during the hearing that he need to support his \nassertions with documents. Copies of tax returns, tax transcripts, correspondence with \nthe IRS and state tax authority, correspondence with creditors, or documents showing \npayment of his debts. No documentation was received following the hearing.  \n \nThe date Applicant\u2019s tax returns were actually filed is not part of the record. \nHowever, in December 2017, he said he was going to contact an attorney to help him file \nhis returns and the letter from his attorney asserting filings had been made is dated \nDecember 2018. A willful failure to timely make (means completed and filed with the IRS) \na federal income tax return is a misdemeanor-level federal criminal offense.3 For \n                                            \n3Title 26 U.S.C, \u00a7 7203, willful failure to file return, supply information, or pay tax, reads: \n  \nAny person . . . required by this title or by regulations made under authority thereof to \nmake a return, keep any records, or supply any information, who willfully fails to . . . make \nsuch return, keep such records, or supply such information, at the time or times required \nby law or regulations, shall, in addition to other penalties provided by law, be guilty of a \nmisdemeanor . . . .  \n \nA willful failure to make tax return, keep records, or supply information when required, is a misdemeanor \nwithout regard to existence of any tax liability. Spies v. United States, 317 U.S. 492 (1943); United States \n\n   \n \n10 \n \n \npurposes of this decision, I am not weighing Applicant\u2019s failure to timely file his federal \nincome tax returns against him as a federal crime. The failure to timely file federal tax \nreturns has security implications because:  \n \nFailure to file tax returns suggests that an applicant has a problem with \ncomplying with well-established governmental rules and systems. Voluntary \ncompliance with such rules and systems is essential for protecting classified \ninformation. ISCR Case No. 01-05340 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 20, 2002). As we \nhave noted in the past, a clearance adjudication is not directed at collecting \ndebts. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 07-08049 at 5 (App. Bd. Jul. 22, 2008). By \nthe same token, neither is it directed toward inducing an applicant to file tax \nreturns. Rather, it is a proceeding aimed at evaluating an applicant\u2019s \njudgment and reliability. Id. A person who fails repeatedly to fulfill his or her \nlegal obligations does not demonstrate the high degree of good judgment \nand reliability required of those granted access to classified information. \nSee, e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015). See \nCafeteria & Restaurant Workers Union Local 473 v. McElroy, 284 F.2d 173, \n183 (D.C. Cir. 1960), aff\u2019d, 367 U.S. 886 (1961).  \n \nThe Appeal Board ruled that \u201ceven in instances where an \u201c[a]pplicant has \npurportedly corrected [his or her] federal tax problem, and the fact that [applicant] is now \nmotivated to prevent such problems in the future, does not preclude careful consideration \nof [a]pplicant\u2019s security worthiness in light of [his or her] longstanding prior behavior \nevidencing irresponsibility\u201d including a failure to timely file federal income tax returns. See \nISCR Case No. 15-01031 at 3 and note 3 (App. Bd. June 15, 2016). \n \nNotwithstanding the lack of any tax debt owed, failing to timely file tax returns \nindicates an individual fails to demonstrate the degree of good judgment and reliability \nrequired of persons granted access to classified information.  \n \nIn this instance AG \u00b6 20(g) does not apply because none of the delinquent taxes \nhave been paid and there is no arrangement with the IRS or the state tax authority to \nrepay the delinquent taxes. Applicant\u2019s reason for his failure to file his federal and state \ntax returns in a timely manner was not reasonable.  \nApplicant\u2019s indicated his current financial status was poor, but that he was working \nhis way out of his financial problems. He has been employed in his current job three and \na half years, but the only debt he has established as paid is a $420 (SOR 1.a) debt. He \nhas provided no correspondence showing he has remained in contact with his creditors \nor the holder of the judgment. He has been less than diligent in addressing his \nlongstanding financial problems.  \n                                            \nv. Walker, 479 F.2d 407 (9th Cir. 1973); United States v. McCabe, 416 F.2d 957 (7th Cir. 1969); O\u2019Brien v. \nUnited States, 51 F.2d 193 (7th Cir. 1931). \n\n   \n \n11 \n \n \nNone of the mitigating conditions sufficiently mitigate the financial considerations \nsecurity concerns. AG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply because the behavior did not happen long \nago, the delinquent debts remain unpaid, and are, therefore, \u201ca continuing course of \nconduct.\u201d Additionally, he failed to file his Federal tax returns for six years and his state \nreturns for five years. \n \nApplicant did have a number of events that were beyond his control. His 2011 \nretirement from the Navy was a major shift in his lifestyle. After retiring, he was unable to \nsecure a job paying as much as his Navy compensation. At the same time, his wife \ndeveloped medical problems, which forced her to stop working outside of the home. For \nAG \u00b6 20(b) to apply there must be factors beyond his control causing his financial \ndifficulties and he must act reasonably under the circumstances. He has not acted \naggressively to address his delinquent obligations or to contact his creditors. Under the \ncircumstances, he has not acted reasonably. There has been no showing of a good-faith \neffort to repay overdue creditors \n \nApplicant disputes the $300 debt arising from television provider equipment and \n$900 debt from a telephone service provider. He asserts he returned the equipment, \nwhich the companies deny. For AG \u00b6 20(e) to apply there must not only be a reasonable \nbasis to dispute the debt, but Applicant must provide documented proof substantiating \nthe basis of the dispute or provides evidence of action to resolve the issue. Applicant \nprovided no documentation substantiating the basis of his claims, and he said he had not \nbeen in contact with one of the creditors in two or three years.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment.  \n\n   \n \n12 \n \n \n \nA security clearance adjudication is an evaluation of an individual\u2019s judgment, \nreliability, and trustworthiness. It is not a debt-collection procedure. Applicant is a 46-year-\nold avionics technician who has been employed by a defense contractor since July 2015. \nHe honorably served in the U.S. Navy from 1991 through 2011. While serving, he had an \nassignment as a Navy recruiter a position routinely given only to service members \nshowing excellent character and judgment. He transitioned from military service to civilian \nlife, which is a major lifestyle change and often stressful. However, that change occurred \nseven years ago. \n \nTwo of Applicant\u2019s largest debts of concern were two student loan obligations. \nIncurring a student loan is seen as an obligation incurred to improve an individual\u2019s life, \nwith respect to future employment and career prospects, and, as such, is viewed \ndifferently than a debt obligation incurred to purchase a new car or incurred for credit card \ndebt. However, the student loan obligations remain unpaid. \n \nApplicant has been aware of the Government\u2019s concern about his delinquent debts \nsince his December 2017 interview when he was specifically confronted about each of \nhis delinquent accounts now listed in the SOR. Additionally, the April 2018 SOR put him \non notice of the Government\u2019s concern about his delinquent accounts. He paid one small \ncollection account. He provided no documentation regarding his past efforts to address \nhis delinquent debt and has failed to establish repayment agreements to address the \ndelinquent debts. Applicant has failed to mitigate the security concerns arising from his \nfinancial considerations.  \n \nThis decision should not be construed as a determination that Applicant cannot or \nwill not attain the state of true reform and rehabilitation necessary to be eligible for a \nsecurity clearance. The determination of an individual\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a \nsecurity clearance is not a once in a lifetime occurrence, but is based on applying the \nfactors, both disqualifying and mitigating, to the evidence presented. Under Applicant=s \ncurrent circumstances, a clearance is not warranted. In the future, Applicant may well \ndemonstrate persuasive evidence of his security worthiness should he pay the judgment \nand establish repayment agreements addressing his delinquent taxes and his delinquent \nstudent loan obligations.  \n \nThe issue is not simply whether all the delinquent obligations have been paid\u2014it \nis whether his financial circumstances raise concerns about his fitness to hold a security \nclearance. (See AG & 2(c)) Overall, the record evidence leaves questions and doubts \nabout Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, \nApplicant has failed to mitigate the financial considerations concerns. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n\n   \n \n13 \n \n \n \nParagraph 1, Financial Considerations: AGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.b \u2013 1.j:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant a security clearance. \nEligibility for access to classified information is denied.  \n \n \n \n_______________________ \nCLAUDE R.

(Government Exhibit (GE) 1) \nOn June 21, 2018, the Department of Defense (DOD) Consolidated Adjudications Facility \n(CAF) issued a statement of reasons (SOR) to Applicant under Executive Order (Exec. \nOr.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry, February 20, 1960; DOD \nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(Directive), January 2, 1992; and Security Executive Agent Directive 4, establishing in \nAppendix A the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for \nAccess to Classified Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AGs), effective \nJune 8, 2017. (Hearing Exhibit (HE) 2)  \n \nThe SOR detailed reasons why the DOD CAF did not find under the Directive that \nit is clearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant or continue a security \n\n \n2 \n                                         \n \nclearance for Applicant and recommended referral to an administrative judge to \ndetermine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. \nSpecifically, the SOR set forth security concerns arising under Guideline F (financial \nconsiderations). (Transcript (Tr.) 27-28; Hearing Exhibit (HE) 4) On November 1, 2018 \nand June 25, 2019, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals issued amended SORs \nalleging additional allegations under Guideline F. (HE 5, 6) \n \nOn July 26, 2018, May 15, 2019, and June 25, 2019, Applicant responded to the \nSOR and amended SORs. (Tr. 28; HE 5, 6) On July 16, 2018, he requested a hearing. \n(HE 5) On November 8, 2018, Department Counsel was ready to proceed. On January \n3, 2019, the case was assigned to an administrative judge. On May 13, 2019, the case \nwas transferred to me for administrative reasons. On June 10, 2019, DOHA issued a \nnotice of hearing, setting the hearing for June 27, 2019, using video teleconference.

(Tr. 19; GE 1-6; Applicant Exhibit (AE) A-AE C) On July 11, 2019, DOHA \nreceived a transcript of the hearing. On August 16, 2019, Applicant submitted three \nexhibits, an email and two .pdf documents, which were admitted without objection. (AE \nD-AE F) On August 19, 2019, Applicant submitted an email.

SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.c, and 1.d allege Applicant failed to timely file his federal \nincome tax returns for tax years 2014, 2015, and 2017. Applicant used accountants to \nhelp him file his income tax returns for at least the previous 10 years. (Tr. 35-36) Applicant \nsaid the IRS initially audited tax years 2008, 2009, and 2010, and he was first notified that \nadditional taxes were due in 2013 or 2014. (Tr. 31)  \n \nOn November 8, 2012, the IRS wrote Applicant and explained that the IRS \nreclassified Applicant and some other workers from \u201cindependent contractors\u201d or 1099 \nfilers to \u201cemployees\u201d who receive W-2s from their employer. (Tr. 31; AE C at 31) The IRS \ndenied Schedule C expense deductions; however, Applicant was credited with the \nemployer paying the employer\u2019s share of Social Security taxes. (AE C at 31) For tax year \n2009, Applicant owed an additional $17,000 and for tax year 2010, Applicant owed an \nadditional $6,000. The IRS advised Applicant that he could appeal the IRS examination. \n(Tr. 31-32; AE C at 29) On October 16, 2013, the IRS wrote Applicant about his tax debt \nfor tax years 2009 and 2010 and indicated he owed a total of about $40,000 for those two \nyears. (GE 6) The IRS provided a detailed list of the charges and changes for those tax \nyears. (GE 6)  \n \nThe IRS represented that Applicant owed the following federal income tax debts: \n \nTax \nYear \nAdjusted \nGross \nIncome \nIRS Claim at \nBankruptcy \nProceeding \nIRS Claim of \nInterest and \nPenalties to \nPetition Date of \nAug. 11, 2018 \nExhibit \n2008 \n$140,000 \nn/a \nn/a \nGE 3 at 3 \n2009 \n$135,000 \n$17,000 \n$8,000 \nAE A at 3; AE C at 5; GE \n3 at 5 \n2010 \n$135,000 \n$14,000 \n$4,000 \nAE A at 3; AE C at 5; GE \n3 at 9 \n2011 \n$108,000 \nn/a \nn/a \nAE A at 3; AE C at 5; GE \n3 at 13 \n2012 \n$109,000 \nn/a \nn/a \nGE 3 at 15 \n2013 \n$106,000 \nn/a \nn/a \nGE 3 at 17  \n2014 \nUnknown \n$10,000 \n$1,000 \nAE A at 3; AE C at 5 \n2015 \nUnknown \n$10,000 \n$1,000 \nAE A at 3; AE C at 5 \n2016 \n$108,000 \nn/a \nn/a \nGE 3 at 23 \n2017 \nUnknown \n$11,000 \n$0 \nAE A at 3; AE C at 5; GE \n3 at 25 \nTotal \n \n$62,000 \n$15,000+$9,000=\n$24,000 \nAE C at 5 \n \nApplicant did not disclose any delinquent debts and that he failed to timely file or \nfully pay his federal income taxes when due on his May 31, 2015 security clearance \n\n \n4 \n                                         \n \napplication (SCA). (GE 1) In Applicant\u2019s February 20, 2018 Office of Personnel \nManagement (OPM) personal subject interview (PSI), he discussed the IRS tax lien, said \nhe disputed his tax debt, and claimed he timely filed all tax returns. (GE 2 at 7-8) In the \nOPM PSI, Applicant said he had a plan to resolve his delinquent debts, and he intended \nto execute that plan. (GE 2 at 10) He blamed his delinquent debts on his former spouse\u2019s \ngambling and excessive spending. (GE 2 at 10-11)  \n \nThe IRS indicated as of August 11, 2018, Applicant\u2019s federal income tax debt \ntotaled $85,000. (AE C at 5) The IRS summary included information about taxes, interest, \nand penalties. (AE C at 5)  The IRS letter also notes that the IRS had not received a tax \nreturn for tax years 2014, 2015, and 2017, and Applicant owed delinquent taxes and/or \ninterest and penalties for tax years 2009, 2010, 2014, 2015, and 2017. (AE C at 1, 5; GE \n3 at 19, 21; GE 3 at 25) Applicant\u2019s accountant also said he owed delinquent taxes for \ntax year 2011 ($206). (AE C at 1, 5) \n \nOn December 18, 2018, the U.S. Attorney filed a response in Applicant\u2019s \nbankruptcy indicating: (1) Applicant did not appeal the audits for tax years 2009 and 2010, \nand the audit\u2019s determination of his tax debt constitute his tax liability; and (2) Applicant \nnever filed a tax return for tax year 2014. (GE 6 at 65)   \n \nApplicant said he timely filed the tax returns, and he had copies of them. (Tr. 36-\n37) I asked Applicant to provide copies of the tax returns for tax years 2014, 2015, and \n2015. (Tr. 65) He said he was going to ask his accountant when she submitted those tax \nreturns. (Tr. 65) He sent a registered mail receipt showing something was submitted to \nthe IRS on April 15, 2015, and he said this was his 2014 federal income tax return. (Tr. \n66, 73; AE A at 2) I have credited Applicant with timely filing his federal income tax return \nfor tax year 2014. He said he was unaware that the IRS had not received his tax returns \nuntil 2018 when he received the IRS information at his bankruptcy. (Tr. 37) He said he \n\u201creproduced\u201d the tax returns and received the refunds. (Tr. 37) \n \nApplicant\u2019s May 22, 2018 IRS tax transcript for tax year 2016 indicates a $4,000 \nrefund was transferred to address his debt for tax year 2009 on April 15, 2017. (GE 3 at \n24)  \n \nOn May 20, 2019, the IRS notified Applicant that he was credited with a $4,000 \nrefund for tax year 2015, and this refund was applied to his tax debt for tax year 2009. \n(AE C at 9) He was also credited with a $3,000 refund for tax year 2017, and this refund \nwas applied to his tax debt for tax year 2009. (AE C at 11)  \n \nApplicant said he was unwilling to settle with the IRS because the IRS kept \nchanging the amounts owed. (Tr. 53, 60) He said the IRS did not act in good faith. (Tr. \n54) He believed everyone who worked for his employer was targeted by the IRS. (Tr. 54-\n55) Applicant believed he was making constructive progress resolving his federal income \ntax debt because he recently asked the IRS for an advocate to be appointed. (Tr. 34) He \nwanted the tax advocate to obtain a settlement amount from the IRS, and then negotiate \nan offer in compromise and payment plan. (Tr. 60)  \n \n\n \n5 \n                                         \n \nApplicant\u2019s May 10, 2019 IRS tax transcript for tax year 2009 shows a zero balance \nowed. (AE C at 17-22) On October 8, 2018, the IRS wrote off the balance due of $30,000. \n(AE C at 22) It is unclear why the IRS applied the refunds of $4,000 and $3,000 for tax \nyears 2015 and 2017 to tax year 2009 because they were applied in 2019 after the IRS \nwrote off the balance owed for 2009. \n \nApplicant\u2019s May 22, 2018 IRS tax transcript for tax year 2009 shows $30,000 owed. \n(GE 3 at 5) The most recent payment that was not a refund from another tax year was \n$150 paid on February 27, 2017. (GE 3 at 8)  \n \nOn June 25, 2019, Applicant\u2019s accountant wrote that Applicant owed an \nunspecified amount to the IRS for tax year 2009, and citing a May 19, 2019, IRS tax \ntranscript, the accountant said Applicant owed $24,000 to the IRS for tax year 2010. (Tr. \n57; AE C at 1-2, 24-28) The most recent payment toward his tax debt for tax year 2010, \naccording to the May 19, 2019 IRS tax transcript, was $150 on February 10, 2014. (AE C \nat 27; GE 3 at 11) The IRS added $11,000 to the debt for tax year 2010 on February 10, \n2014 \u201cby examination.\u201d (AE C at 2, 27; GE 3 at 11) The accountant was unsure about the \nbasis of examination\u2019s result. (AE C at 2) Applicant\u2019s accountant believes the tax debt for \ntax year 2010 is unsettled and might be substantially less. (Tr. 58; AE C at 2)  \n \nApplicant believed the IRS miscalculated his taxes, and he was actually taxed as \nboth an employee and an independent contractor. (Tr. 32) Applicant believed the lien was \nfiled against his residence; he was able to refinance his mortgage; and he believed the \nlien was lifted. (Tr. 33) Applicant said that his accountant determined he might be due a \nrefund. (Tr. 32) \n \nOn September 30, 2019, Applicant sent an email and provided an Installment \nAgreement Request, IRS Form 9465 indicating he offered to settle a $48,000 IRS debt \nby making $884 monthly payments for 72 months. (AE G; AE I) Applicant\u2019s signature is \ndated September 27, 2019. (AE I) Payments under the installment agreement start on \nNovember 25, 2019. (AE I)  \n \nApplicant continues to contest the amount of the tax debt, and his accountant plans \nto meet with a taxpayer advocate. (AE I; AE J) Applicant\u2019s accountant promised to work \nwith the taxpayer advocate to resolve Applicant\u2019s tax issues. (AE J) \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.e alleges Applicant filed for bankruptcy under Chapter 13 of the \nBankruptcy Code in August 2018, and it was dismissed on April 25, 2019. Applicant said \nthe IRS was not cooperating with him, and he filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy protection. \n(Tr. 38) His attorney advised him that the bankruptcy was a good idea, and he went along \nwith this advice. (Tr. 60) The bankruptcy required monthly payments that Applicant \nbelieved he could not afford; the IRS \u201cchanged the deal\u201d; and he elected not to continue \nthe bankruptcy. (Tr. 39-41) He received a $19,000 refund from the bankruptcy court. (Tr. \n51) He said he was retaining the $19,000 for the present. (Tr. 51) He has about $35,000 \nin his 401(k) account, and he is holding those funds in reserve too.

Applicant said his former spouse handled the family finances \nduring their marriage, and she mismanaged these two credit cards. (Tr. 41-43) Applicant \nassumed responsibility for the debts in his divorce, and the creditor charged off the debts. \n(Tr. 42) He accepted responsibility for the debts, and he said it was very difficult to settle \nthem. (Tr. 42) In a letter dated August 2, 2019, the creditor for the $9,286 debt agreed to \nsettle the debt for $5,575 with the first installment payment of $3,645 due by August 1, \n2019. (AE E) It is unclear why the letter is dated after the first payment is due. (AE E) He \ndid not present any evidence of payments actually made to address these two delinquent \nbank debts. \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.h alleges Appellant\u2019s has a $208,760 mortgage debt that is $15,601 past \ndue. Applicant said the account became past due during the Chapter 13 mortgage \nprocess. (Tr. 43) On July 12, 2019, Applicant accepted a new payment arrangement with \nthe mortgage lender, and on July 18, 2019, the mortgage lender signed the agreement. \n(Tr. 44; AE B; AE F) At the time of his hearing, he expected to make his first mortgage \npayment under the new agreement on August 1, 2019; however, according to his \nmortgage agreement, his first payment is due on September 1, 2019. (Tr. 45; AE F) \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.i alleges Appellant has a $2,103 credit-card debt that is $258 past due. \nApplicant said he erroneously indicated in response to a DOHA interrogatory that he was \nresponsible for the debt. (Tr. 46) He subsequently determined that he was an authorized \nuser on this credit-card account, and he was not responsible for this debt. (Tr. 45-47)  \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.j alleges Appellant has a $1,061 bank debt that is $293 past due. \nApplicant was responsible for this debt in the divorce decree. (Tr. 47) Applicant said he \nwas unaware of this account, and it did not appear in his credit report. (Tr. 47) He \naccepted responsibility for this debt in his SOR response. \n \nApplicant said he did not have any formal financial counseling; however, he did \nreceive advice and counsel from his accountant. (Tr. 55) His Chapter 13 bankruptcy filing \nindicates he had credit counseling within 180 days of filing his Chapter 13 bankruptcy in \nAugust 2018. (GE 6 at 5 of 54) He uses a monthly budget, and he sets aside about half \nof his income for debt resolution. (Tr. 55-56) \n \nCharacter Evidence \n \nA GG-13 has known Applicant for more than 20 years and worked with Applicant \nfor nine years. (AE A at 5) He described Applicant as loyal and trustworthy, and he \nrecommended approval of Applicant\u2019s security clearance. (AE A at 5)  \n \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \n\n \n7 \n                                         \n \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The President \nhas authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicant\u2019s eligibility for \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865. \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable.  \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Clearance \ndecisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \nThus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that it is based, in whole or \nin part, on any express or implied determination about applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or \npatriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the \nPresident, Secretary of Defense, and DNI have established for issuing a clearance. \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 \n(App. Bd. May 2, 1996). \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of disproving a \nmitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 \n(App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, \non the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b). \n \n \n \n\n \n8 \n                                         \n \nAnalysis \n \nFinancial Considerations \n \nAG \u00b6 18 articulates the security concern for financial problems: \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . . \n \nThe Appeal Board explained the scope and rationale for the financial \nconsiderations security concern in ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) \n(citation omitted) as follows: \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might \nknowingly compromise classified information in order to raise money in \nsatisfaction of his or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the \ntotality of an applicant\u2019s financial history and circumstances. The Judge \nmust consider pertinent evidence regarding the applicant\u2019s self-control, \njudgment, and other qualities essential to protecting the national secrets as \nwell as the vulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive \npresumes a nexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines \nand an applicant\u2019s security eligibility.  \n \n  \nAG \u00b6 19 includes disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern and \nmay be disqualifying in this case: \u201c(a) inability to satisfy debts\u201d; \u201c(b) unwillingness to satisfy \ndebts regardless of the ability to do so\u201d; \u201c(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d; \nand \u201c(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income tax returns \nor failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as required.\u201d The record \nestablishes AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), 19(b), 19(c), and 19(f).  \n \nAG \u00b6 20 lists financial considerations mitigating conditions which may be applicable \nin this case:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n\n \n9 \n                                         \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts;   \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue;  \n \n(f) the affluence resulted from a legal source of income; and \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n \nThe DOHA Appeal Board concisely explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for proving \nthe applicability of mitigating conditions as follows:  \n \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of \na security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government \npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the \napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The \nstandard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in \nEgan, supra. \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access \nto classified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nDirective, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 2(b).  \n \nISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013).  \n \nApplicant\u2019s spouse was financially irresponsible, and his marriage to her ended in \ndivorce. Applicant believed he was an independent contractor when he filed his tax \nreturns. The IRS subsequently determined he was an employee. This change in status \nresulted in substantial additional taxes owed to the IRS. These are circumstances beyond \nhis control that adversely affected his finances. However, these circumstances are \ninsufficiently detailed to prove he acted responsibly under the circumstances. He received \nfinancial counseling during the Chapter 13 bankruptcy process, and he generated a \nbudget; however, there are not clear indications his financial problems are under control. \nHe did not establish that he was unable to better address his delinquent taxes and other \ndebts. He did not provide proof that he diligently attempted to establish payment plans to \naddress his taxes that he learned were delinquent in 2013 and three other nontax \ndelinquent debts. He did not establish a track record of payment of his delinquent debts.  \n\n \n10 \n                                         \n \nA debt that became delinquent several years ago is still considered recent because \n\u201can applicant\u2019s ongoing, unpaid debts evidence a continuing course of conduct and, \ntherefore, can be viewed as recent for purposes of the Guideline F mitigating conditions.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 15-06532 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 16, 2017) (citing ISCR Case No. 15-01690 \nat 2 (App. Bd. Sept. 13, 2016)). \n \nApplicant\u2019s SOR does not allege he did not disclose any delinquent debts and his \nfailure to timely file or fully pay his federal income taxes when due on his May 31, 2015 \nSCA. In ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006), the Appeal Board listed \nfive circumstances in which conduct not alleged in an SOR may be considered stating:  \n \n(a) to assess an applicant\u2019s credibility; (b) to evaluate an applicant\u2019s \nevidence of extenuation, mitigation, or changed circumstances; (c) to \nconsider whether an applicant has demonstrated successful rehabilitation; \n(d) to decide whether a particular provision of the Adjudicative Guidelines is \napplicable; or (e) to provide evidence for whole person analysis under \nDirective Section 6.3.  \n \nId. (citing ISCR Case No. 02-07218 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 15, 2004); ISCR Case No. 00-\n0633 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 24, 2003)). See also ISCR Case No. 12-09719 at 3 (App. Bd. \nApr. 6, 2016) (citing ISCR Case No. 14-00151 at 3, n. 1 (App. Bd. Sept. 12, 2014); ISCR \nCase No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006)). The allegation that he did not disclose \nany delinquent debts and his failure to timely file or fully pay his federal income taxes \nwhen due on his May 31, 2015 SCA will not be considered except for the five purposes \nlisted above. Inaccurate information in an SCA is particularly important in the assessment \nof Applicant\u2019s credibility and promises to resolve debts. \n \nApplicant has taken an important step towards showing his financial responsibility. \nIn late 2018 or 2019, he filed his federal income tax returns for tax years 2015 and 2017; \nhowever, his filing of his tax return for tax year 2015 was not timely. I decline to credit him \nwith timely filing his federal tax return for tax year 2015 without a statement from his \naccountant or an email showing when his tax return was filed or at least sent to the IRS. \nOn May 20, 2019, the IRS notified Applicant that he was credited with a $4,000 refund for \ntax year 2015, and this refund was applied to his tax debt for tax year 2009. (AE C at 9) \nHe should have known that his tax return for tax year 2015 was not filed earlier when he \ndid not receive a refund, and instead he received a bill from the IRS, which is an indication \nthe IRS generated a substitute return.  \n \nA willful failure to timely make (means complete and file with the IRS) a federal \nincome tax return is a misdemeanor-level federal criminal offense. Title 26 U.S.C, \u00a7 7203, \nwillful failure to file return, supply information, or pay tax, reads:  \n \nAny person . . . required by this title or by regulations made under authority \nthereof to make a return, keep any records, or supply any information, who \nwillfully fails to . . .  make such return, keep such records, or supply such \ninformation, at the time or times required by law or regulations, shall, in \naddition to other penalties provided by law, be guilty of a misdemeanor . . . . \n\n \n11 \n                                         \n \nA willful failure to make return, keep records, or supply information when required, \nis a misdemeanor without regard to existence of any tax liability. Spies v. United States, \n317 U.S. 492 (1943); United States v. Walker, 479 F.2d 407 (9th Cir. 1973); United States \nv. McCabe, 416 F.2d 957 (7th Cir. 1969); O\u2019Brien v. United States, 51 F.2d 193 (7th Cir. \n1931). For purposes of this decision, I am not weighing Applicant\u2019s failure to timely file his \nfederal income tax returns against him as a federal crime. In regard to the failure to timely \nfile federal and state income tax returns, the DOHA Appeal Board has commented: \n \nFailure to file tax returns suggests that an applicant has a problem with \ncomplying with well-established governmental rules and systems. Voluntary \ncompliance with such rules and systems is essential for protecting classified \ninformation. ISCR Case No. 01-05340 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 20, 2002). As we \nhave noted in the past, a clearance adjudication is not directed at collecting \ndebts. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 07-08049 at 5 (App. Bd. Jul. 22, 2008). By \nthe same token, neither is it directed toward inducing an applicant to file tax \nreturns. Rather, it is a proceeding aimed at evaluating an applicant\u2019s \njudgment and reliability. Id. A person who fails repeatedly to fulfill his or her \nlegal obligations does not demonstrate the high degree of good judgment \nand reliability required of those granted access to classified information. \nSee, e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015). See \nCafeteria & Restaurant Workers Union Local 473 v. McElroy, 284 F.2d 173, \n183 (D.C. Cir. 1960), aff\u2019d, 367 U.S. 886 (1961). \n \nISCR Case No. 14-04437 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 15, 2016) (emphasis in original). See ISCR \nCase No. 14-05476 at 5 (App. Bd. Mar. 25, 2016) (citing ISCR Case No. 01-05340 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Dec. 20, 2002)); ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 4-5 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015). The \nAppeal Board clarified that even in instances where an \u201c[a]pplicant has purportedly \ncorrected [his or her] federal tax problem, and the fact that [applicant] is now motivated \nto prevent such problems in the future, does not preclude careful consideration of \n[a]pplicant\u2019s security worthiness in light of [his or her] longstanding prior behavior \nevidencing irresponsibility\u201d including a failure to timely file federal income tax returns. See \nISCR Case No. 15-01031 at 3 and note 3 (App. Bd. June 15, 2016) (characterizing \u201cno \nharm, no foul\u201d approach to an Applicant\u2019s course of conduct and employing an \u201call\u2019s well \nthat ends well\u201d analysis as inadequate to support approval of access to classified \ninformation with focus on timing of filing of tax returns after receipt of the SOR).   \n \nIn ISCR Case No. 15-01031 at 2 (App. Bd. June 15, 2016), the Appeal Board \nreversed the grant of a security clearance, and noted the following primary relevant \ndisqualifying facts:  \n \nApplicant filed his 2011 Federal income tax return in December 2013 and \nreceived a $2,074 tax refund. He filed his 2012 Federal tax return in \nSeptember 2014 and his 2013 Federal tax return in October 2015. He \nreceived Federal tax refunds of $3,664 for 2012 and $1,013 for 2013. \n \nEven if no taxes are owed when tax returns are filed, the Appeal Board provided the \nfollowing principal rationale for reversing the grant of a security clearance: \n\n \n12 \n                                         \n \nFailure to comply with Federal and/or state tax laws suggests that an \napplicant has a problem with abiding by well-established Government rules \nand regulations. Voluntary compliance with rules and regulations is \nessential for protecting classified information.  .  .  .  By failing to file his \n2011, 2012, and 2013 Federal income tax returns in a timely manner, [that \napplicant] did not demonstrate the high degree of good judgment and \nreliability required of persons granted access to classified information.  \n \nISCR Case No. 15-01031 at 4 (App. Bd. June 15, 2016) (citations omitted). AG \u00b6 20(g) \napplies in part because he filed his tax returns and paid some of his required taxes; \nhowever, the timing of the filing of his tax returns is an important aspect of the analysis. \nIn ISCR Case No. 15-06440 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 26, 2017) the Appeal Board reversed the \ngrant of a security clearance, discussed how AG \u00b6 20(g) applied, and noted: \n \nThe timing of the resolution of financial problems is an important factor in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s case for mitigation because an applicant who \nbegins to resolve financial problems only after being placed on notice that \nhis clearance was in jeopardy may lack the judgment and self-discipline to \nfollow rules and regulations over time or when there is no immediate threat \nto his own interests. In this case, Applicant\u2019s filing of his Federal income tax \nreturns for 2009-2014 after submitting his SCA, undergoing his background \ninterview, or receiving the SOR undercuts the weight such remedial action \nmight otherwise merit. \n \nApplicant\u2019s SOR indicates two large delinquent debts are in charged-off status on \nhis credit report. A \u201ccharged-off debt\u201d is an accounting entry. A creditor considers a debt \nowed to the creditor to be an asset. When the value of the asset is in doubt, the creditor \nis required to change the status of the debt to reflect its current status. When the debt \nappears to be uncollectible, the creditor should change the status for accounting purposes \nfrom being an asset to charged off. Notwithstanding the change to charged-off status, a \ncreditor may still sell the debt to a collection agent, and the debtor may still pay or settle \nthe debt. Eventually, the charged-off debts will be dropped from the debtor\u2019s credit report. \n\u201c[T]hat some debts have dropped off his credit report is not meaningful evidence of debt \nresolution.\u201d ISCR Case No. 14-05803 at 3 (App. Bd. July 7, 2016) (citing ISCR Case No. \n14-03612 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 25, 2015)). The Fair Credit Reporting Act requires removal \nof most negative financial items from a credit report seven years from the first date of \ndelinquency or the debt becoming collection barred because of a state statute of \nlimitations, whichever is longer. Title 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681c. See Federal Trade Commission \nwebsite, Summary of Fair Credit Reporting Act Updates at Section 605, \nhttps://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/pdf-0111-fair-credit-reporting-act.pdf. Debts may \nbe dropped from a credit report upon dispute when creditors believe the debt is not going \nto be paid, a creditor fails to timely respond to a credit reporting company\u2019s request for \ninformation, or when the debt has been charged off. \u201cMere evidence that debts no longer \nappear on credit reports is not reason to believe that they are not legitimate or that they \nhave been satisfactorily resolved.\u201d ISCR Case No. 16-02941 at 2 (App. Bd. Dec. 29, 2017) \n(citing ISCR Case No. 14-03747 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Nov. 13, 2015)).  \n \n\n \n13 \n                                         \n \nApplicant received a settlement offer on the charged-off debt in SOR \u00b6 1.f for \n$9,286, and he did not establish that he was unable to settle the debt earlier with the \ntermination of his bankruptcy and the return of $19,000 from the bankruptcy court.   \n \nIn sum, Applicant\u2019s accountant said Applicant owed $24,000 to the IRS for tax year \n2010. On September 27, 2019, Applicant signed an offer to the IRS to begin payments \nunder the installment agreement on November 25, 2019, to address a $48,000 tax debt. \nApplicant failed to prove he timely filed his federal income tax return for tax year 2015. \nThere is insufficient evidence about why Applicant was unable to file his federal tax return \nfor tax year 2015 on time. He owes two charged-off debts to the same bank for $9,286 \nand $10,590, and he owes a $1,061 bank debt that is $293 past due. He has not made \nany recent payments to address any of these debts. He did not establish he was unable \nto make greater progress resolving his delinquent SOR debts, including his delinquent \ntaxes. Applicant failed to establish mitigation of financial considerations security concerns \nfor the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.c, 1.f, 1.g, and 1.j. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), \u201c[t]he ultimate determination\u201d of whether to grant a security \nclearance \u201cmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines\u201d and the whole-person concept. My comments under Guideline F are \nincorporated in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that guideline but some warrant additional comment. \n \nApplicant is a 46-year-old database administrator for a defense contractor. He has \n93 college credits, and he has substantial vocational training. From 1995 to 2001, he \nserved in the Army. When he left active duty, he was a sergeant. He worked for several \ngovernment contractors from 2001 to the present. He was married from 1995 to 2018, \nand in June 2019, he married. His children are ages 8, 15, 22, and 23. A GG-13 has \nknown Applicant for more than 20 years and worked with Applicant for nine years. He \ndescribed Applicant as loyal and trustworthy, and he recommended approval of \nApplicant\u2019s security clearance.  \n \n\n \n14 \n                                         \n \nApplicant owes $24,000 to the IRS for tax year 2010. On September 27, 2019, \nApplicant signed an offer to the IRS to begin payments under the installment agreement \non November 25, 2019, to address a $48,000 tax debt, which includes the tax debt for \ntax year 2010. Applicant plans to continue to contest the amount of his tax debt. Applicant \nfailed to prove he timely filed his federal income tax return for tax year 2015.  \n \nThe Appeal Board\u2019s emphasis on security concerns arising from tax cases is \ninstructive and binding on administrative judges. See ISCR Case No. 14-05794 at 7 (App. \nBd. July 7, 2016) (reversing grant of security clearance and stating, \u201cHis delay in taking \naction to resolve his tax deficiency for years and then taking action only after his security \nclearance was in jeopardy undercuts a determination that Applicant has rehabilitated \nhimself and does not reflect the voluntary compliance of rules and regulations expected \nof someone entrusted with the nation\u2019s secrets.\u201d); ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 2-6 (App. \nBd. Aug. 18, 2015) (reversing grant of a security clearance, discussing lack of detailed \ncorroboration of circumstances beyond applicant\u2019s control adversely affecting finances, \nnoting two tax liens totaling $175,000 and garnishment of Applicant\u2019s wages, and \nemphasizing the applicant\u2019s failure to timely file and pay taxes); ISCR Case No. 12-05053 \nat 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 30, 2014) (reversing grant of a security clearance, noting not all tax \nreturns filed, and insufficient discussion of Applicant\u2019s efforts to resolve tax liens).  \n \nMore recently, in ISCR Case No. 14-05476 (App. Bd. Mar. 25, 2016) the Appeal \nBoard reversed a grant of a security clearance for a retired E-9 and cited his failure to \ntimely file state tax returns for tax years 2010 through 2013 and federal returns for tax \nyears 2010 through 2012. Before the retired E-9\u2019s hearing, he filed his tax returns and \npaid his tax debts except for $13,000, which was in an established payment plan. The \nAppeal Board highlighted his annual income of over $200,000 and discounted his non-\ntax expenses, contributions to DOD, expenditures for his children\u2019s college tuition and \nexpenses, and spouse\u2019s serious medical and mental health problems. The Appeal Board \nemphasized \u201cthe allegations regarding his failure to file tax returns in the first place stating, \nit is well settled that failure to file tax returns suggest that an applicant has a problem with \ncomplying with well-established government rules and systems. Voluntary compliance \nwith such rules and systems is essential for protecting classified information.\u201d Id. at 5 \n(citing ISCR Case No. 01-05340 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 20, 2002) (internal quotation marks \nand brackets omitted). See also ISCR Case No. 14-03358 at 3, 5 (App. Bd. Oct. 9, 2015) \n(reversing grant of a security clearance, noting $150,000 owed to the federal government, \nand stating \u201cA security clearance represents an obligation to the Federal Government for \nthe protection of national secrets. Accordingly failure to honor other obligations to the \nGovernment has a direct bearing on an applicant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability \nto protect classified information.\u201d).  \n \nThe primary problems here relate to his handling of his federal income taxes. \nApplicant knew that he needed to file his federal income tax return for tax year 2015, and \nhe did not file it until late 2018 or 2019. He owes a federal income tax debt that is not in \nan established payment plan. An established payment plan requires a track record of \npayments, and the first payment under his plan has not been made. He had a legal \nrequirement to timely file his tax returns and pay his taxes. He may not have fully \nunderstood or appreciated the importance of these requirements. He procrastinated. His \n\n \n15 \n                                         \n \nactions under the Appeal Board jurisprudence are too little, too late to fully mitigate \nsecurity concerns. \n \nIn addition to Applicant\u2019s tax issues, he owes two charged-off debts to the same \nbank for $9,286 and $10,590, and he owes a $1,061 bank debt that is $293 past due. He \nhas not made any recent payments to address any of these debts. He did not establish \nhe was unable to make greater progress resolving his delinquent SOR debts, including \nhis delinquent taxes. Applicant\u2019s failure to \u201csatisfy debts, and meet financial obligations \nmay indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and \nregulations, all of which can raise questions about [his] reliability, trustworthiness, and \nability to protect classified or sensitive information.\u201d AG \u00b6 16. \n \nIt is well settled that once a concern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s security \nclearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption against granting a security clearance. \nSee Dorfmont, 913 F. 2d at 1401. I have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Egan, \nExec. Or. 10865, the Directive, the AGs, and the Appeal Board\u2019s jurisprudence to the \nfacts and circumstances in the context of the whole person. Unmitigated financial \nconsiderations security concerns lead me to conclude that grant of a security clearance \nto Applicant is not warranted at this time.   \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n  \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT  \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a, 1.c, 1.f, 1.g, and 1.j:  \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.b, 1.d, 1.e, 1.h, and 1.i: \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s \neligibility for a security clearance.

Applicant admitted the allegation, but indicated that she had completed her tax returns for tax year 2014 as of May 29, 2018. After considering the pleadings, exhibits, and transcript, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant is a 65-year-old widow with a 29-year-old son, who has had mental-health issues since he was a young child. Her son lives with her, and he has Social Security disability income. Applicant has a bachelor\u2019s degree awarded in June 1982. She spent most of her career in the commercial sector.

Temple, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n______________ \nDecision \n______________ \nMATCHINSKI, Elizabeth M., Administrative Judge: \nApplicant did not timely file her Federal and state income tax returns for tax years \n2013 and 2014. Her Federal income tax return for tax year 2014 was filed in June 2018, \nbut her ongoing failure to file her delinquent returns for 2013 and her state income tax \nreturn for 2014 casts doubt about her judgment and reliability. Clearance is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn May 4, 2018, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility \n(DOD CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, detailing a security \nconcern under Guideline F, financial considerations. The SOR explained why the DOD \nCAF was unable to find it clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue \nsecurity clearance eligibility for her. The DOD CAF took the action under Executive Order \n(EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the National Security Adjudicative \nGuidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to \nHold a Sensitive Position (AG) effective within the DOD on June 8, 2017. \n11/19/2018\n\n2 \n \nApplicant responded to the SOR on May 29, 2018, and requested a hearing before \nan administrative judge from the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA). On July \n18, 2018, the case was assigned to me to conduct a hearing to determine whether it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for \nApplicant. On August 6, 2018, I scheduled a hearing for September 17, 2018. \n \nAt the hearing, three Government exhibits (GEs 1-3) were admitted. A June 25, \n2018 letter forwarding the proposed GEs to Applicant was marked as a hearing exhibit (HE \n1) for the record but not admitted in evidence. Seven Applicant exhibits (AEs A-G) were \nadmitted in evidence. Applicant testified, as reflected in a transcript (Tr.) received on \nSeptember 26, 2018. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nThe SOR alleges under Guideline F that Applicant failed to file, as required, her \nFederal and state income tax returns for tax years 2013 and 2014 (SOR \u00b6 1.a). Applicant \nadmitted the allegation, but indicated that she had completed her tax returns for tax year \n2014 as of May 29, 2018. After considering the pleadings, exhibits, and transcript, I make \nthe following findings of fact. \n \nApplicant is a 65-year-old widow with a 29-year-old son, who has had mental-health \nissues since he was a young child. Her son lives with her, and he has Social Security \ndisability income. Applicant has a bachelor\u2019s degree awarded in June 1982. She spent \nmost of her career in the commercial sector. In June 2015, she lost her employment of 33 \nyears when she was laid off during a reduction-in-force. She was unemployed until August \n2016, when she began working in the defense industry as a technical content manager for \nher current employer. (GEs 1, 3; Tr. 47, 50-51.) \n \nApplicant did not file her Federal and state income tax returns when they were due \nfor tax years 2013 and 2014. She filed for an extension to October 2014 to file her income \ntax returns for tax year 2013. Shortly before the deadline, her son was hospitalized for six \nweeks from October 2014 to November 2014. Insurance claims show that the institutional \nprovider filed medical claims with Applicant\u2019s then insurer for $18,084 for her son on \nOctober 14, 2014, and for $18,084 on November 1, 2014. Applicant had medical issues of \nher own from January 2014 through May 2015. (AE D.) She did not file her tax returns for \n2013, but paid the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) an estimated tax liability of $462. When \nher Federal and state income tax returns for 2014 were due in 2015, she attempted to file \nfor an extension using tax software but was unsuccessful because she had not filed her \nincome tax returns for 2013. She made a Federal tax payment of $400 for tax year 2014 at \nthe tax deadline without submitting her tax return. (GE 2; AE E; Tr. 40-42.)  \n \nOn July 28, 2016, Applicant completed and certified to the accuracy of a \nQuestionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86) for a DOD security clearance needed \nfor access to military bases without an escort. (Tr. 45.) In response to financial record \ninquiries concerning whether she had failed to file or pay any Federal, state, or other taxes, \n\n3 \n \nApplicant indicated that she had failed to file state income taxes for 2013, but that she had \nsatisfied a tax assessment of $196 in May 2016. (GE 1.)  \n \nOn September 26, 2017, Applicant was interviewed by an authorized investigator for \nthe Office of Personnel Management (OPM). She volunteered that she prepares and files \nher income tax returns, and that she failed to file her Federal and state income tax returns \nfor tax year 2013. She asserted that she paid a $500 late filing fee, but had not yet filed her \nreturns for 2013. She denied any intention to evade taxes and attributed her failure to file to \nprocrastination; to having to locate some paperwork needed for her tax returns for tax year \n2013; and to feeling overwhelmed at times about filing her tax returns. Applicant stated that \nshe had filed her returns for subsequent tax years. She explained that she was considering \nhiring a professional accountant to file her tax returns for 2013 and all income tax returns \ndue in the future. (GE 3.) She did not recall at the time that she had also not filed her \nincome tax returns for tax year 2014. (Tr. 40.) \n \nOn October 25, 2017, Applicant was re-interviewed by telephone. She admitted she \nhad not yet filed her delinquent Federal and state income tax returns for tax years 2013. \nShe clarified that she paid fees of $500 to the IRS and $196 to the state for not filing her \nreturns for tax year 2013. (GE 3.) \n \nIn response to a January 23, 2018, request from the DOD CAF, Applicant provided \non March 23, 2018, her IRS tax account transcripts for tax years 2013 through 2016. The \nIRS account transcripts showed that she had paid the IRS $426 in April 2014 for tax year \n2013 and $400 in April 2015 for tax year 2014, with no returns filed for those tax years. \nShe filed her Federal tax return for tax year 2015 on time and was entitled to a $170 refund \non adjusted gross income of $69,447. She submitted her Federal income tax return for tax \nyear 2016 within the extended deadline and was issued a Federal tax refund of $2,387 on \nadjusted gross income of $36,372. As of May 23, 2018, state tax records showed that she \npaid $196 in May 2016 for tax year 2013, and $200 on April 15, 2015, for tax year 2014. \nTax returns had not been received by the state for tax year 2013 or 2014. She filed her \nstate income tax returns on time for tax year 2015 and 2016. She paid $146 for tax year \n2015 and was credited $1,216 for tax year 2016. (GE 2.) \n \n \nApplicant filed her Federal income tax return for tax year 2014 on June 1, 2018, \nusing tax software. She was assessed penalties for late filing and late payment. She paid \nalmost $277 on August 21, 2018, in full resolution of her Federal tax delinquency for tax \nyear 2014. (AE E; Tr. 42-43, 52.) As of her hearing in September 2018, she had completed \nher state income tax return for tax year 2014 using tax software, but she had not submitted \nit. She expected a state tax refund of $500 for tax year 2014. (Tr. 52.) \n \n \nApplicant had not filed her Federal or state income tax returns for tax year 2013 as \nof her September 17, 2018 hearing. (Tr. 51-52.) It is too late to file online for tax year 2013 \nso she has to obtain the paper forms to file the returns. (Tr. 43, 54.) She believes that she \nhas a \u201cmental block against [filing] taxes.\u201d She consulted psychotherapists and behavioral \ntherapists \u201cprobably before 2014 and 2015\u201d about her anxiety in that regard. (Tr. 46, 53-\n54.) She also has \u201ctrouble with the paperwork and getting all the records together because \n\n4 \n \n[she is] a little bit disorganized, especially with paperwork, and [she tends] to put things \noff.\u201d (Tr. 47.) She finds tax preparation confusing but has not sought professional \nassistance because gathering the paperwork is her responsibility, and she has difficulty \ndoing it. (Tr. 56-57.) \n \n \nApplicant had not filed her Federal and state income tax returns for tax year 2017 as \nof September 2018, but she had an extension to file to mid-October 2018. (Tr. 57.) When \nasked about her intention regarding filing her tax returns on time in the future, she \nresponded: \n \nWell, I can\u2019t give you a big guarantee, but I will try because this is kind of a \nbig mess. And I\u2019m not sure if I will be working next year on April 15th, but I\u2019ll \nhave plenty of time to get the paper\u2014get the things together, get all the \npapers together. I\u2019ve had some medical issues, so that\u2019s kind of, you know, I \ncome home and I just go to bed. But, you know, I mean, basically it\u2019s my \nresponsibility. It\u2019s my\u2014you know, I\u2019m not saying that those things are the \nreasons why I haven\u2019t done it, but it is definitely my big\u2014my big sore spot. \nAnd it doesn\u2019t really make sense, because I think that I would have had more \nmoney in refunds if I had filed my taxes on time and, you know, found the \npaperwork to do the insurance correctly and, you know, the medical \ndeductions and all that stuff. (Tr. 64-65.) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s annual gross income is approximately $85,000. (Tr. 58.) She has an \ninvestment portfolio with a value exceeding $500,000 as of late April 2018. (AE A.) She has \na mortgage on her home that she repays at $2,248 per month. As of early June 2018, the \nprincipal balance of her mortgage loan was $203,565. She has more than $400,000 in \nequity in her home. (AE B.) \n \nA military officer familiar with Applicant\u2019s work performance attested that her \nattention to detail and commitment to her duties is invaluable. She has been an \u201coverall \ncontributor\u201d to the organization\u2019s success. He has \u201cutmost confidence\u201d in her dedication \nand her abilities to execute her duties, and he considers her to be of \u201cgreat moral \ncharacter.\u201d In his opinion, Applicant has demonstrated that she is worthy of being trusted \nwith the security clearance needed to perform her work more effectively. (AE G.) \n \nA co-worker described Applicant as \u201cefficient, detail-oriented, and extremely \ncompetent.\u201d Applicant has been extremely responsible and a leader when it comes to \nmeeting project schedules with quality. She has demonstrated an understanding of \ncomplex technical content and high interpersonal skills. This co-worker highly recommends \nApplicant as a valuable asset. (AE F.) \n \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion the Executive \nBranch has in regulating access to information pertaining to national security,  emphasizing \nthat \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 \n\n5 \n \nU.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, \nthe administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be considered in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. These guidelines \nare not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, \nthese guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative \nprocess. The administrative judge\u2019s overall adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative \njudge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, \nfavorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence \nto establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant \nis responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation about potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7 of EO 10865 \nprovides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section \n3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information). \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \n \n \nThe security concerns about financial considerations are articulated in AG \u00b6 18: \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness \nto abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or \nsensitive information. Financial distress can also be caused or exacerbated \n\n6 \n \nby, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other issues of personnel security \nconcern such as excessive gambling, mental health conditions, substance \nmisuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . . \n \n \nThe Appeal Board explained the scope and rationale for the financial considerations \nsecurity concern in ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) (citation omitted) \nas follows: \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money in satisfaction of \nhis or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the totality of an \napplicant\u2019s financial history and circumstances. The Judge must consider \npertinent evidence regarding the applicant\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other \nqualities essential to protecting the national secrets as well as the \nvulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive presumes a \nnexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines and an \napplicant\u2019s security eligibility. \n \nApplicant did not timely file her Federal and state income tax returns for tax years \n2013 and 2014. She did not intend to evade any taxes and paid what she estimated she \nowed when the tax returns were due. Even so, Guideline F security concerns are \nestablished when an individual fails to comply with her tax filing obligations whether or not \nany taxes are owed. Disqualifying condition AG \u00b6 19(f), \u201cfailure to file or fraudulently filing \nannual Federal, state, or local income tax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or \nlocal income tax as required,\u201d applies. \n \nApplicant has the burden of establishing that matters in mitigation apply. Regarding \npossible mitigation under the AGs, one or more of the following conditions under AG \u00b6 20 \nmay apply: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under \nsuch circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem from a \nlegitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit counseling service, \nand there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under \ncontrol; \n\n7 \n \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s Federal and state income tax returns for 2013 were due in October 2014 \nbecause she had timely requested an extension of the filing deadline. Her Federal and \nstate income tax returns for 2014 were due in April 2015 because she did not obtain the \nsix-month automatic extension of the filing deadline.1 Her initial noncompliance was not \nrecent, but she had not filed any of her delinquent tax returns by the issuance of the SOR \non May 4, 2018. As of her September 2018 hearing, she had not filed her Federal and \nstate income tax returns for tax year 2013 or her state income tax return for tax year 2014. \nHer failure to comply with her tax-filing obligation is an ongoing course of conduct that is \nnot mitigated under AG \u00b6 20(a). \n \nApplicant has a case for partial mitigation under AG \u00b6 20(b) in that her son had \nserious mental-health issues that led to his hospitalization shortly before her income tax \nreturns were due for tax year 2013. Applicant submitted some medical insurance claims \ninformation (AE D) for herself and her disabled son from January 2014 through May 2015, \nwhich could explain some delay in filing her income tax returns for tax year 2014 as well. \nHowever, AG \u00b6 20(b) requires that an individual act responsibly once the crisis has passed, \nand Applicant has not provided sufficient evidence of unforeseen circumstances or \nsituations outside of her control that could justify the inordinate delay in addressing her \ndelinquent tax returns for 2013 and 2014. She attributed her difficulty in filing her tax \nreturns to psychological issues (\u201cmental block\u201d and anxiety) for which she sought treatment \nbefore 2015, but she managed to file her tax returns for 2015 and 2016 on time. She was \nunemployed from June 2015 until August 2016 and yet did not gather the paperwork \nneeded and file all of her delinquent tax returns. AG \u00b6 20(b) does not fully apply. \n \nAGs \u00b6\u00b6 20(c), 20(d), and 20(g) have some applicability because she filed her \nFederal income tax return for tax year 2014 in June 2018, after she received the SOR. She \nhad her state income tax return for 2014 ready for electronic filing as of her September \n2018 security clearance hearing, but inexplicably had not submitted her return. \n \nApplicant is credited with filing her income tax returns for tax years 2015 and 2016 \non time. This shows some ability to comply with her tax-filing obligations, notwithstanding \nher reported anxiety about tax filing and difficulties in gathering her paperwork. Even where \ntax problems have been corrected and an applicant is motivated to prevent such problems \nin the future, the administrative judge is not precluded from considering an applicant\u2019s \ntrustworthiness in light of longstanding prior behavior evidencing irresponsibility. See e.g., \n                                                 \n1 The state allows for an automatic six-month extension to file the state income tax return provided Applicant \npaid at least 80% of the total amount of taxes due on or before the due date. However, the taxpayer is \nrequired to apply for the extension for it to be granted. \n\n8 \n \nISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 2015). The Appeal Board has long held that \nthe failure to file tax returns suggests a problem with complying with well-established \ngovernment rules and systems. See e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-04437 (App. Bd. Apr. 15, \n2016). Moreover, the Appeal Board recently reaffirmed that the timing of corrective action \nis an appropriate factor to consider in applying AG \u00b6 20(g). See e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-\n01382 at 4 (App. Bd. May 16, 2018) (citing ISCR Case No. 17-01807 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Mar. \n7, 2018)). In reversing favorable clearance grants to applicants with tax issues by DOHA \njudges in ISCR Case No. 17-01382 (App. Bd. May 16, 2018) and ISCR Case No. 16-01211 \n(App. Bd. May 30, 2018), the Appeal Board noted that applicants who only begin to \naddress their delinquent tax returns after having been placed on notice that their clearance \nmight be in jeopardy may not comply with laws, rules, and regulations when their \nimmediate interests are not imperiled. \n \nApplicant was placed on notice as of her July 2016 SF 86 that failure to file tax \nreturns when required by law was an issue for the DOD in granting security clearance \neligibility. During her September 2017 interview and on receipt of January 2018 \ninterrogatories from the DOD CAF, Applicant was reminded that her tax matters were of \nconcern. As of her September 2018 hearing, she had not filed three of the four delinquent \ntax returns. While there is nothing in the Directive that requires an individual to resolve all \nof the SOR concerns before she can be granted a security clearance, doubt persists about \nwhether she can be counted on to comply with her tax filing obligations in the future. Her \ntestimony that she \u201cwill try because this is kind of a big mess\u201d does not inspire confidence \nin her ability or willingness to attend to this important civic and legal responsibility. The \nfinancial considerations security concerns are not fully mitigated. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nIn assessing the whole person, the administrative judge must consider the totality of \nan applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative \nprocess factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). The analysis under Guideline F is incorporated in my whole-\nperson analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were addressed under that guideline, but \nsome warrant additional comment. \n \n \nThe security clearance adjudication involves an evaluation of an applicant\u2019s \njudgment, reliability, and trustworthiness in light of the security guidelines in the Directive. \nSee ISCR Case No. 09-02160 (App. Bd. Jun. 21, 2010). Applicant\u2019s dedication to her work \nwith a defense contractor is unassailable, and there is no indication that she has exercised \npoor judgment on the job. Applicant understandably was distracted by her son\u2019s mental \nhealth issues requiring hospitalization when her tax returns for 2013 were due. Applicant \nshowed good judgment in seeking professional help to address her anxiety about filing tax \nreturns. However, Applicant\u2019s ongoing inattention to her tax return filings for tax year 2013, \nwithout adequate justification, raises considerable doubt about whether she fully \nappreciates the importance of complying with her tax-filing obligations. The Appeal Board \nhas repeatedly held that the government need not wait until an applicant mishandles or \nfails to safeguard classified information before denying or revoking security clearance \neligibility. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 08-09918 (App. Bd. Oct. 29, 2009) (citing Adams v. \n\n9 \n \nLaird, 420 F.2d 230, 238-239 (D.C. Cir. 1969)). It is well settled that once a concern arises \nregarding an applicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption against \nthe grant or renewal of a security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 \n(9th Cir. 1990). Under Appeal Board precedent, an applicant who waits to address tax \nissues until his or her immediate interests are at stake does not show sound judgment and \nreliability. Her failure to give priority to such an important obligation as filing tax returns \nrequired by law causes lingering doubt about her security worthiness that has not been fully \nmitigated. \n \nFormal Finding \n \nFormal finding for or against Applicant on the allegation set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, is: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for \naccess to classified information is denied. \n \n \n_____________________ \nElizabeth M. Matchinski \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Connelley, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n______________ \nDecision \n______________ \nHESS, Stephanie C., Administrative Judge: \nApplicant did not mitigate the security concerns raised by his significant delinquent \ndebts. (Financial Considerations.) Access to classified information is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (e-QIP) on January 5, 2017. \nOn April 26, 2018, the Department of Defense (DOD) sent him a Statement of Reasons \n(SOR), alleging security concerns under Guideline F. The DOD acted under Executive \nOrder (E.O.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, \n1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) implemented by DOD on June 8, 2017.  \nApplicant answered the SOR on May 22 2018, and requested a decision on the \nrecord without a hearing. Department Counsel submitted the Government\u2019s written case \non July 30, 2018. On July 31, 2018, a complete copy of the file of relevant material \n(FORM,) which included Government Exhibits (GX) 1 through 6, was sent to Applicant, \nwho was given an opportunity to file objections and submit material to refute, extenuate, \n03/14/2019\n\n \n2\nor mitigate the Government\u2019s evidence. He received the FORM on August 14, 2018, and \ndid not file a Response.1 The case was assigned to me on December 14, 2018.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nUnder Guideline F, the SOR alleges that Applicant filed Chapter 13 Bankruptcy in \nApril 2015 and was dismissed in August 2016 for failure to make payments, and has 14 \ndelinquent accounts totaling $179,408 including a Federal tax debt of $26,376.

(GX 5; GX 4; GX 3; GX 3.) Details concerning the Chapter 13 Bankruptcy \nare reflected in bankruptcy court records. (GX 6.) Applicant\u2019s admissions are incorporated \nin my findings of fact.   \n \nApplicant is a 57-year-old program manager currently working for a defense \ncontractor since 1984. He received his bachelor\u2019s degree in 1984. He married in 1979 \nand divorced in 2015. He was first granted a security clearance in 2006. (GX 2; GX 3.)  \n \nApplicant  states that he filed Chapter 13 Bankruptcy in April 2015 due to the costs \nof a contested divorce, including legal expenses, and the impact that the loss of his \nspouse\u2019s income had on his ability to maintain his monthly financial obligations.  (GX 3.) \nApplicant began making bankruptcy plan payments in May 2015, but later fell behind on \nhis payments. In July 2016, the trustee filed a motion for dismissal for noncompliance with \nthe payments and, despite Applicant\u2019s objection, the judge dismissed the bankruptcy. \nApplicant filed a motion to reconsider the order of dismissal, the motion was denied, and \nthe order dismissing the bankruptcy for noncompliance with the agreed payment plan \nbecame final in August 2016. (GX 6.) \n \nHowever, in his PSI, Applicant stated that he withdrew his bankruptcy in August \n2016 to obtain a mortgage-loan modification. Applicant stated in his Answer, \u201cI voluntarily \nsuspended the Chapter 13 Bankruptcy plan on the advice of my lawyer until I could get a \nfirst mortgage loan modification plan approved.\u201d \n \n In his Answer, Applicant asserts that he is on an approved IRS payment plan for \nhis $26,376 delinquent tax debt. (SOR \u00b6 1.b.) Applicant also states that he settled the \n$1,593 judgment (SOR \u00b6 1.c). He did not submit any documentation in support of these \nassertions.  \n \n                                            \n1 The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) transmittal letter is dated June 1, 2018, and \nApplicant\u2019s receipt is dated June 14, 2018. The DOHA transmittal letter informed Applicant that he had 30 \ndays after receiving it to submit information.  The DOHA transmittal letter and receipt are appended to the \nrecord as Administrative Exhibit 1. \n \n\n \n3\nApplicant was granted the mortgage-loan modification in August 2016, and his \nmonthly payments are approximately $3,300. However, his April 2018 CBR shows a past-\ndue balance of $3,335 (SOR \u00b6 1.d). (GX 3.)  \n \nDuring his PSI, Applicant stated his intention of refiling Chapter 13 Bankruptcy to \nresolve all his outstanding delinquent accounts no later than June 2018. In his May 2018 \nAnswer, Applicant admitted SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e through 1.o, stating that the debts would be \nresolved through refiling Chapter 13 Bankruptcy at the direction of his attorney. Applicant \ndid not submit any evidence of refiling Chapter 13 Bankruptcy or any other evidence of \nefforts to resolve his debts. \n \nApplicant stated during his PSI that he has not participated in any financial \ncounseling, nor has he been advised to do so. However, he was required to complete an \nonline financial-counseling course as a condition of participating in a Chapter 13 \nBankruptcy. He categorized his financial situation as \u201cpoor.\u201d \n \nPolicies \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended.  \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant\u2019s meeting the \ncriteria contained in the AG. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, \nrecognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies these \nguidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available and reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. Or. \n10865 \u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the \n\n \n4\napplicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense \nhave established for issuing a clearance. \n \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 92-1106 at 3, \n1993 WL 545051 at *3 (App. Bd. Oct. 7, 1993).  \n \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \n \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18:  \n \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is financially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. \n \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified \ninformation. See ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \n \n \n \n \n\n \n5\n \nThe record establishes the following disqualifying conditions: \n \nAG \u00b6 19(a): inability to satisfy debts;  \n \nAG \u00b6 19(c): a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n \nAG \u00b6 19(f): failure to file . . . annual Federal, state, or local income tax \nreturns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s financial issues are recent, ongoing, and unresolved. Applicant is \nlegally obligated to pay his $179,408 in tax and other debts and failure to do so raises \nconcerns about his willingness to abide by rules and regulations, and about his reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and good judgment. Applicant did not provide any evidence of any \nresolution of or recent actions he has taken to resolve his ongoing delinquent accounts. \nAlthough Applicant was required to complete an online financial-counseling course in \nconjunction with his bankruptcy, he does not recall having done so. None of the mitigating \nconditions apply. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a).  \n \n \nI have considered the factors in AG \u00b6 2(a) and incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating \nconditions under Guideline F, and evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole \nperson, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns raised by his \nsignificant delinquent debt. Accordingly, I conclude he has not carried his burden of \nshowing that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him eligibility for \naccess to classified information. \n  \nFormal Findings \n \nAs required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, I make the following \nformal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): AGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.o:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n\n \n6\nConclusion \n \n \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information \nis denied. \n \n \n \nStephanie C. Hess \nAdministrative Judge \n \n \n \n",

Applicant\u2019s admissions to the SOR and those at her hearing are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a thorough review of the record evidence, including her testimony and demeanor while testifying, I make the following additional findings of fact: Applicant is a 29-year-old employee of a federal contractor. She graduated from high school in 2007, and completed some college courses, but has not earned a degree. Shortly after high school, she enlisted in the U.S. Air Force where she honorably served on active duty until August 2012. She married her spouse in 2011. They have two children, ages six and one. In her November 2016 SCA, Applicant disclosed that she had financial problems that included two voluntarily repossessed cars, delinquent rent payments, and delinquent credit accounts. Most of the disclosed debts are alleged in the SOR. Applicant explained that her financial problems resulted from her 2012 discharge from the service and her husband\u2019s 2014 discharge, both of which resulted in a loss of income. Without his earnings, they were unable to pay their living expenses and accumulated debts. After her discharge from the Air Force in 2012, Applicant enlisted in the Air National Guard-Reserve (ANGR) where she worked part-time between September 2012 and May 2013.

She should have been more diligent addressing her \ndelinquent accounts. Notwithstanding, she recently paid off six of her delinquent \naccounts and filed for bankruptcy protection to resolve the remaining debts. Her \nfinancial problems are being resolved and are under control. Clearance granted. \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant submitted her most recent security clearance application (SCA) on \nNovember 11, 2016, seeking eligibility for a clearance required for her position with a \nfederal contractor. After reviewing the information gathered during the background \ninvestigation, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued her a Statement of Reasons \n(SOR) alleging security concerns under Guideline F (financial considerations) on May \n11, 2018. She answered the SOR and requested a hearing before an administrative \njudge from the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) on June 8, 2018.  \nDOHA assigned the case to me on September 12, 2018. The Notice of Hearing \n(NOH) was issued on November 28, 2018, setting a hearing for January 9, 2019. At the \nhearing, the Government offered three exhibits (GE 1 through 3). Applicant testified and \n03/15/2019\n\n \n2 \n \n \nsubmitted five exhibits. (AE 1 through 5) AE 5 was received post-hearing. All exhibits \nwere admitted without objection. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on January \n16, 2019. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nIn her SOR answer, Applicant admitted the 14 financial allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a \nthrough 1.n. Applicant\u2019s admissions to the SOR and those at her hearing are \nincorporated herein as findings of fact. After a thorough review of the record evidence, \nincluding her testimony and demeanor while testifying, I make the following additional \nfindings of fact:  \n \nApplicant is a 29-year-old employee of a federal contractor. She graduated from \nhigh school in 2007, and completed some college courses, but has not earned a \ndegree. Shortly after high school, she enlisted in the U.S. Air Force where she \nhonorably served on active duty until August 2012. She married her spouse in 2011. \nThey have two children, ages six and one.  \n \nIn her November 2016 SCA, Applicant disclosed that she had financial problems \nthat included two voluntarily repossessed cars, delinquent rent payments, and \ndelinquent credit accounts. Most of the disclosed debts are alleged in the SOR. \nApplicant explained that her financial problems resulted from her 2012 discharge from \nthe service and her husband\u2019s 2014 discharge, both of which resulted in a loss of \nincome. Without his earnings, they were unable to pay their living expenses and \naccumulated debts. \n \nAfter her discharge from the Air Force in 2012, Applicant enlisted in the Air \nNational Guard-Reserve (ANGR) where she worked part-time between September 2012 \nand May 2013. She worked in an ANGR full-time position between May 2013 and \nJanuary 2015. She has been in an ANGR part-time position since January 2015. Her \ncurrent rank is staff sergeant (E-5). Because of her position in the Air Force, she has \nheld a secret clearance since 2007, which has been continued to present. A federal \ncontractor, her current employer and clearance sponsor, hired Applicant as a systems \nadministrator in August 2015, and she was been working there until the present. \n \nMost of the alleged SOR debts date back to the period between her discharge \nfrom the service in 2012, and her husband\u2019s discharge in 2014. Applicant testified that \nshe was unable to address her delinquent debts sooner, or more responsibly, because \ntheir earnings were insufficient to pay for their living expenses and accumulated debts. \nAfter her pregnancy discharge, she was supposed to become a stay-at-home mom, and \nher spouse was supposed to be the primary breadwinner. She also held a part-time \nANGR position. \n \nApplicant\u2019s spouse was discharged under a force-reduction program, and he was \nunable to find a job. Additionally, her husband has a post-traumatic stress disorder \n(PTSD) medical condition that has hampered his search for full-time employment.  \n\n \n3 \n \n \nAs of her hearing day, Applicant\u2019s husband was attending a trade school to \nbecome an electrician. His studies are being paid by the Department of Veteran\u2019s \nAffairs (VA) and he receives a $2,000 monthly housing allowance. She anticipates he \nwill graduate around November 2019. Applicant\u2019s current monthly income is about \n$3,242, and their gross income is about $5,242. Applicant\u2019s budget shows a total of \n$4,868 in monthly expenses, with little money left over after paying their living \nexpenses. \n \nApplicant and her husband have been contemplating filing for bankruptcy \nprotection since 2016. She met with a bankruptcy attorney back in 2016, but resisted \nthe idea. They did not file for bankruptcy protection because they were concerned about \nthe security clearance consequences of filing for bankruptcy and because they did not \nhave the money to pay the bankruptcy attorney fees \u2013 about $1,500.  \n \nApplicant purchased financial books and sought information on how to resolve \nher delinquent debts. She tried to follow \u201cDave Ramsey\u2019s snowball effect\u201d process to \npay her debts. It recommends paying the smallest debt first, and continuing to pay the \ndebts one by one. Applicant determined that the system would be okay to pay their \nsmall debts, but they would never be able to address the larger delinquent debts. \nApplicant met with a financial counselor from her ANGR unit in June 2018. After running \nthe numbers, the financial counselor recommended Applicant file for bankruptcy \nprotection.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s evidence shows that she paid 6 of the 14 delinquent SOR debts: \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.h ($248); 1.i ($185, AE 5); 1.k ($324, AE 5); and 1.l through 1.n. Applicant anticipates \nresolving the remaining eight SOR debts through the Chapter 7 bankruptcy process, \nwhich was filed in January 2019. (See AE 5). \n \nApplicant acknowledged that she should have been more diligent paying her \ndelinquent accounts. However, she believes she was doing the best she could do under \nher circumstances. She understands the seriousness of the security concerns raised by \nher financial problems. Applicant credibly promised to timely pay her debts in the future \nand to resolve her financial problems.  \n \nApplicant believes that with her current income, her financial situation is now \nstable, and she will be able to maintain her financial responsibility and eligibility for a \nclearance. Applicant understands that for her to be eligible for a clearance, and to \nmaintain her job with a federal contractor and the ANGR, she has to maintain and \ndemonstrate her financial responsibility.  \n \nPolicies \n \nThe SOR was issued under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information Within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive) \n(January 2, 1992), as amended; and the  Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining \n\n \n4 \n \n \nEligibility for Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position \n(AG), implemented by the DOD on June 8, 2017.  \n \nEligibility for access to classified information may be granted \u201conly upon a finding \nthat it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, \u00a7 2. The \nU.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive Branch \nin regulating access to information pertaining to national security, emphasizing that \u201cno \none has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988). \n \nThe AG list disqualifying and mitigating conditions for evaluating a person\u2019s \nsuitability for access to classified information. Any one disqualifying or mitigating \ncondition is not, by itself, conclusive. However, the AG should be followed where a case \ncan be measured against them, as they represent policy guidance governing access to \nclassified information. Each decision must reflect a fair, impartial, and commonsense \nconsideration of the whole person and the factors listed in SEAD 4, App. A \u00b6\u00b6 2(d) and \n2(f). All available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, must be considered.  \n \nSecurity clearance decisions resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s security clearance. The Government \nmust prove, by substantial evidence, controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If it does, \nthe burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts. The \napplicant bears the heavy burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue his or her security clearance.  \n \nPersons with access to classified information enter into a fiduciary relationship \nwith the Government based on trust and confidence. Thus, the Government has a \ncompelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgment, \nreliability, and trustworthiness of those who must protect national interest as their own. \nThe \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any \nreasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the Government. \n\u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d \nEgan, 484 U.S. at 531; SEAD 4, \u00b6 E(4); SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6\u00b6 1(d) and 2(b). Clearance \ndecisions are not a determination of the loyalty of the applicant concerned. They are \nmerely an indication that the applicant has or has not met the strict guidelines the \nGovernment has established for issuing a clearance. \n \nAnalysis \n \nFinancial Considerations \n \nAG \u00b6 18 articulates the security concern relating to financial problems:  \n \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \n\n \n5 \n \n \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified information. Financial distress can also be caused or \nexacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other issues of \npersonnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental health \nconditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . .  \n \nApplicant\u2019s history of financial problems is documented in the record. AG \u00b6 19 \nprovides two disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \u201c(a) inability to satisfy debts\u201d; and \u201c(c) a history of not meeting \nfinancial obligations.\u201d The record established the disqualifying conditions, requiring \nadditional inquiry about the possible applicability of mitigating conditions.  \n \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially applicable: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation, clear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity \ntheft), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or in under control; and  \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.1  \n                                            \n1 The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a \u201cgood faith\u201d effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts:  \n \nIn order to qualify for application of [the \u201cgood faith\u201d mitigating condition], an applicant \nmust present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \nsome other good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant\u2019s debts. The Directive does \nnot define the term \u201cgood-faith.\u201d However, the Board has indicated that the concept of \ngood-faith \u201crequires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, \nprudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.\u201d Accordingly, an applicant must \ndo more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally available option (such as \nbankruptcy) in order to claim the benefit of [the \u201cgood faith\u201d mitigating condition]. \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \nThe Appeal Board concisely explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for proving the \napplicability of mitigating conditions as follows:  \n \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance \nof a security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government \npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the \napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The \nstandard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in \nEgan, supra. \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for \naccess to classified information will be resolved in favor of the national \nsecurity.\u201d Directive, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 2(b).  \n \nISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013).  \n \n \nAll of the above financial considerations mitigating conditions are raised by the \nfacts in this case and mitigate the security concerns. She developed financial problems \nbecause of circumstances beyond her control, including her pregnancy, her discharge \nfrom the service, her husband\u2019s discharge from the service, his inability to find job, and \nhis PTSD medical condition.  \n \n \nApplicant paid six SOR debts and she intends to resolve the remaining debts \nthrough the Chapter 7 bankruptcy process. Applicant\u2019s financial problems occurred \nunder circumstances unlikely to recur, and they do not cast doubt on her current \nreliability, trustworthiness, or judgment.  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s efforts to resolve her debt, although recent, show diligence and \nresponsibility in the handling of her financial obligations. Applicant received financial \ncounseling and she is following a budget. Considering the evidence as a whole, \nApplicant is resolving her financial problems and her finances are under control. She \ncredibly promised to maintain her financial responsibility. After her bankruptcy \ndischarge, her earnings should be sufficient to pay for her family\u2019s living expenses and \ncurrent debts. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case, and under the whole-person \nconcept. SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6\u00b6 2(a) and 2(d). I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of these factors were addressed under \nthat guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \n \n                                                                                                                                            \n(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2004) (quoting \nISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 4, 2001)).   \n\n \n7 \n \n \nApplicant is a 29-year-old employee of a federal contractor. She served on active \nduty in the Air Force five years (2007 \u2013 2012), and has continued to serve in the ANGR \nto present. She has worked for her current employer since 2015. The record evidence is \nsufficient to establish that her financial problems are being resolved, and her finances \nare under control. She is fully aware of the security concerns raised by her failure to \nmaintain financial responsibility. She promised to maintain her financial responsibility. \nThe financial considerations security concerns are mitigated.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          \n \n  \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:   \n \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n  \nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.n:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant  \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest of the United States to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance to Applicant.

(Government Exhibit \n(GE) 1) On June 13, 2018, the Department of Defense (DOD) Consolidated Adjudications \nFacility (CAF) issued a statement of reasons (SOR) to Applicant under Executive Order \n(Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry, February 20, 1960; \nDOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(Directive), January 2, 1992; and Security Executive Agent Directive 4, establishing in \nAppendix A the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for \nAccess to Classified Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AGs), effective \nJune 8, 2017. (Hearing Exhibit (HE) 2)  \n \nThe SOR detailed reasons why the DOD CAF did not find under the Directive that \nit is clearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant or continue a security \nclearance for Applicant and recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine \n\n \n2                                        \n \nwhether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. Specifically, the \nSOR set forth security concerns arising under Guidelines F (financial considerations) and \nE (personal conduct). (HE 2) On July 5, 2018, Applicant responded to the SOR and \nrequested a hearing. (HE 3)  \n \nApplicant\u2019s hearing was initially scheduled for December 3, 2018; however, the \nhearing was cancelled when Applicant lost sponsorship for a security clearance. On \nSeptember 4, 2019, Department Counsel was ready to proceed. On September 9, 2019, \nthe case was assigned to me. On September 12, 2019, DOHA issued a notice of hearing, \nsetting the hearing for October 2, 2019. (HE 1) The hearing was held as scheduled. \n \nDuring the hearing, Department Counsel offered three exhibits; Applicant offered \nfour exhibits; there were no objections; and all proffered exhibits were admitted into \nevidence. (Tr. 14-18, 33-34, 45-46; GE 1-3; Applicant Exhibit (AE) A-AE D) On October \n15, 2019, DOHA received a transcript of the hearing.

(Tr. 7)  \n \nFinancial Considerations \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.a alleged Applicant failed to timely file his federal income tax returns for \ntax years 2012 through 2016. Applicant admitted he failed to timely file his federal income \ntax returns. He explained why he did not timely file his tax returns as follows: \n \nI claimed kids that I thought were mine at the time, unfortunately. And that \ncame back as a very big hit on my taxes in me owing. And in my mind I \nstated that, you know what? The Government can keep all taxes that I have. \nI don\u2019t require that money back.

Applicant owed the \nfollowing amounts when he filed his state tax returns: 2012 return undated (refund: $300); \n2013 return dated October 2019 (amount owed: $100); 2014 return undated (amount \nowed: $200); 2015 return dated October 2019 (amount owed: $100); and 2016 return \ndated April 2017 (refund: $1,000). (AE E; AE F) Applicant explained that somehow the \nstate tax returns for tax years 2013 and 2015 were not recorded when sent, and they had \nto be refiled in October 2019. (AE H, email) Applicant is credited with intending to file his \nstate tax returns the same month in 2018 as he filed his federal income tax returns. \nInformation from federal income tax returns is easily transferred to state tax returns, and \nApplicant did not have any reason not to file his state tax returns when he filed his federal \nincome tax returns. However, he was negligent in that he should have retained a copy of \nhis state tax returns when he filed them; he should have been able to show that he paid \nthe commercial tax preparer who prepared his federal income tax return to generate both \na federal and state tax return; and he should have noticed when his payments to the state \nfor tax years 2013 and 2015 were not cashed or deducted from his accounts.    \n \n  \nOn April 2, 2018, a state tax lien for $2,000 was vacated and withdrawn. (Tr. 31-\n33; AE C) On February 6, 2018, Applicant established a nine-month payment plan with \nthe state tax authority wherein he agreed to pay $46 a month. (Tr. 31) He said he timely \nmade all of his payments, and his state tax debt is resolved. (Tr. 31, 34) After he filed his \nstate tax returns for tax years 2013 and 2015 in October 2019, he owed additional taxes. \n(AE H) Starting November 15, 2019, Applicant has a payment agreement with the state \ntax authority to pay $65 monthly for three months. (AE H) He timely filed his 2017 and \n2018 federal and state tax returns. (Tr. 28-29; AE A; AE B; AE G) He owes a small state \ntax debt which is less than $40 for tax year 2018. (Tr. 35)  \n \n \nIn May 2018, Applicant agreed to begin making monthly payments to the IRS of \n$25 for the first year and $80 for the second year to address his federal income tax debt \nfor tax years 2012, 2015, and 2016. (Tr. 35-36; GE 2) The IRS letter is inconsistent with \nthe tax information presented in the above table. He made the following monthly \n\n \n4                                        \n \npayments to the IRS from March 2018 to September 2019: March 2018 ($31); June 2018 \nthrough May 2019 ($50); and June 2019 through September 2019 ($85). (AE E) His \npayments were made to address tax debts from tax years 2012, 2017, and 2018. (AE E) \nIt is unclear why Applicant\u2019s federal income tax return for tax year 2012 shows a refund \nof $400; however, the IRS applied the most recent 15 payments up to September 2019 \nto address his federal income tax debt for tax year 2012. (AE E) Applicant did not provide \nan explanation for this inconsistency. \n \n \nIn sum, Applicant failed to timely file his state and federal income tax returns for \ntax years 2011 (filed March 2018), 2013 (filed May 2018), and 2015 (filed March 2018). \nHis 2011, 2013, and 2015 tax returns were filed after he completed his March 18, 2016 \nSCA, and after his June 21, 2017 Office of Personnel Management (OPM) personal \nsubject interview (PSI), but before the SOR was issued on June 13, 2018. The magnitude \nof his current federal income tax debt is unclear. His state and federal income tax debts \nare in the process of being resolved through payment plans. \n \nPersonal Conduct \n \nTwo questions in Section 26 of Applicant\u2019s March 18, 2016 SCA asked about filing \nand paying federal or state income taxes when required during the previous seven years. \nIn response to one question, Applicant disclosed that he failed to file or pay his 2011 state \ntaxes. (GE 1) He said in the comments section that he was audited and his deduction or \nexemption for two dependents was denied, and he owed about $1,000 to the state. Id. \nHe said he had an established payment arrangement to pay $50 monthly to the state. Id. \nThe second question asked whether he had any other instances when he failed to file or \npay federal or state income taxes in the previous seven years as required, and he \nanswered, \u201cno.\u201d Id.  \n \nDuring Applicant\u2019s June 21, 2017 OPM PSI, he disclosed that he had not filed or \npaid his state and federal income tax returns for tax year 2015. (AE D at 11) He said he \ndid not want to deal with taxes anymore and was fearful because of the audit of his 2011 \ntaxes. Id. He said he did not list the failure to file a tax return for tax year 2015 on his SCA \nbecause he overlooked the question. Id. The OPM PSI does not include anything about \nhis not timely filing his income tax returns for tax years 2011 and 2013. (AE D) Applicant \nclarified that he believed the tax audit related to taxes prior to 2010 and not tax year 2011 \nas indicated in his March 18, 2016 SCA. (Tr. 45)   \n \nAt his hearing, Applicant said he did not disclose his failure to timely file his federal \nincome tax returns as follows: \n \nTo be honest why I was very bad with this stuff with taxes and stuff like that, \nI answered to the best of my ability at that time. Until and when it was \nbrought to my attention that it wasn\u2019t, I called IRS, called State as well to \nmake sure that, you know, I\u2019d get all this stuff straightened away. \n \n(Tr. 37)  \n \n \n \n\n \n5                                        \n \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The President \nhas authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicant\u2019s eligibility for \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865. \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable.  \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Clearance \ndecisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \nThus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that it is based, in whole or \nin part, on any express or implied determination about applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or \npatriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the \nPresident, Secretary of Defense, and DNI have established for issuing a clearance. \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 \n(App. Bd. May 2, 1996). \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of disproving a \n\n \n6                                        \n \nmitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 \n(App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, \non the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b). \n \nAnalysis \n \nFinancial Considerations \n \nAG \u00b6 18 articulates the security concern for financial problems: \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . . \n \nThe Appeal Board explained the scope and rationale for the financial \nconsiderations security concern in ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) \n(citation omitted) as follows: \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might \nknowingly compromise classified information in order to raise money in \nsatisfaction of his or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the \ntotality of an applicant\u2019s financial history and circumstances. The Judge \nmust consider pertinent evidence regarding the applicant\u2019s self-control, \njudgment, and other qualities essential to protecting the national secrets as \nwell as the vulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive \npresumes a nexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines \nand an applicant\u2019s security eligibility.  \n \n  \nAG \u00b6 19 includes disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern and \nmay be disqualifying in this case: \u201c(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the \nability to do so\u201d; \u201c(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d; and \u201c(f) failure to file \nor fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income tax returns or failure to pay \nannual Federal, state, or local income tax as required.\u201d The record establishes AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n19(b), 19(c), and 19(f).  \n \nAG \u00b6 20 lists financial considerations mitigating conditions which may be applicable \nin this case:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \n\n \n7                                        \n \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts;   \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue;  \n \n(f) the affluence resulted from a legal source of income; and \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n \nThe DOHA Appeal Board concisely explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for proving \nthe applicability of mitigating conditions as follows:  \n \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of \na security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government \npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the \napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The \nstandard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in \nEgan, supra. \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access \nto classified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nDirective, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 2(b).  \n \nISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013).  \n \nThe SOR alleges and the record establishes that Applicant failed to timely file his \nstate and federal income tax returns for tax years 2013 (filed May 2018) and 2015 (filed \nMarch 2018); however, they were filed before the SOR was issued on June 13, 2018. His \nstate and federal income tax debts are in established payment plans. \n \nA willful failure to timely make (means complete and file with the IRS) a federal \nincome tax return is a misdemeanor-level federal criminal offense. Title 26 U.S.C, \u00a7 7203, \nwillful failure to file return, supply information, or pay tax, reads:  \n \n\n \n8                                        \n \nAny person . . . required by this title or by regulations made under authority \nthereof to make a return, keep any records, or supply any information, who \nwillfully fails to . . .  make such return, keep such records, or supply such \ninformation, at the time or times required by law or regulations, shall, in \naddition to other penalties provided by law, be guilty of a misdemeanor . . . .  \n \nA willful failure to make return, keep records, or supply information when required, \nis a misdemeanor without regard to existence of any tax liability. Spies v. United States, \n317 U.S. 492 (1943); United States v. Walker, 479 F.2d 407 (9th Cir. 1973); United States \nv. McCabe, 416 F.2d 957 (7th Cir. 1969); O\u2019Brien v. United States, 51 F.2d 193 (7th Cir. \n1931). For purposes of this decision, I am not weighing Applicant\u2019s failure to timely file his \nfederal income tax returns against him as a federal crime. \n \nApplicant\u2019s SOR does not allege he failed to timely file when due his federal income \ntax return for tax year 2011 and his state tax returns for tax years 2013 and 2015. His \nSOR does not allege that he owed delinquent federal income taxes for several years. He \nis currently making payments on his federal income tax debt for tax year 2012. Moreover, \nhe did not disclose his failure to file these tax returns and his delinquent federal income \ntaxes on his March 18, 2016 SCA. In ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, \n2006), the Appeal Board listed five circumstances in which conduct not alleged in an SOR \nmay be considered stating:  \n \n(a) to assess an applicant\u2019s credibility; (b) to evaluate an applicant\u2019s \nevidence of extenuation, mitigation, or changed circumstances; (c) to \nconsider whether an applicant has demonstrated successful rehabilitation;  \n(d) to decide whether a particular provision of the Adjudicative Guidelines is \napplicable; or (e) to provide evidence for whole person analysis under \nDirective Section 6.3.  \n \nId. (citing ISCR Case No. 02-07218 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 15, 2004); ISCR Case No. 00-\n0633 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 24, 2003)). See also ISCR Case No. 12-09719 at 3 (App. Bd. \nApr. 6, 2016) (citing ISCR Case No. 14-00151 at 3, n. 1 (App. Bd. Sept. 12, 2014); ISCR \nCase No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006)). The non-SOR allegations will not be \nconsidered except for the five purposes listed above.  \n \nApplicant has taken an important step towards showing his financial responsibility. \nApplicant filed all required tax returns, and his state and federal income tax debts are in \npayment plans. He assured he will timely file all future tax returns.  \n \nIn ISCR Case No. 15-01031 at 2 (App. Bd. June 15, 2016), the Appeal Board \nreversed the grant of a security clearance, and noted the following primary relevant \ndisqualifying facts:  \n \nApplicant filed his 2011 Federal income tax return in December 2013 and \nreceived a $2,074 tax refund. He filed his 2012 Federal tax return in \nSeptember 2014 and his 2013 Federal tax return in October 2015. He \nreceived Federal tax refunds of $3,664 for 2012 and $1,013 for 2013. \n \n\n \n9                                        \n \nEven if no taxes are owed when tax returns are filed, the Appeal Board provided the \nfollowing principal rationale for reversing the grant of a security clearance: \n \nFailure to comply with Federal and/or state tax laws suggests that an \napplicant has a problem with abiding by well-established Government rules \nand regulations. Voluntary compliance with rules and regulations is \nessential for protecting classified information.  .  .  .  By failing to file his \n2011, 2012, and 2013 Federal income tax returns in a timely manner, [that \napplicant] did not demonstrate the high degree of good judgment and \nreliability required of persons granted access to classified information.  \n \nISCR Case No. 15-01031 at 4 (App. Bd. June 15, 2016) (citations omitted). AG \u00b6 20(g) \napplies because he filed his tax returns and paid some of his required taxes; however, \nthe timing of the filing of his tax returns is an important aspect of the analysis. In ISCR \nCase No. 15-06440 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 26, 2017) the Appeal Board reversed the grant \nof a security clearance, discussed how AG \u00b6 20(g) applied, and noted: \n \nThe timing of the resolution of financial problems is an important factor in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s case for mitigation because an applicant who \nbegins to resolve financial problems only after being placed on notice that \nhis clearance was in jeopardy may lack the judgment and self-discipline to \nfollow rules and regulations over time or when there is no immediate threat \nto his own interests. In this case, Applicant\u2019s filing of his Federal income tax \nreturns for 2009-2014 after submitting his SCA, undergoing his background \ninterview, or receiving the SOR undercuts the weight such remedial action \nmight otherwise merit. \n \nIn sum, Applicant failed to timely file his federal tax return for tax year 2011 and \nhis state and federal tax returns for tax years 2013 and 2015. He filed his returns for tax \nyears 2011, 2013, and 2015 after he completed the SCA and his OPM interview. Applicant \nfailed to establish mitigation of financial considerations security concerns.  \n \nPersonal Conduct \n \nAG \u00b6 15 explains why personal conduct is a security concern stating: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes.  \n \n AG \u00b6 16 describes one condition that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case, \u201c(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant \nfacts from any personnel security questionnaire, . . . used to conduct investigations, \ndetermine employment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine national \n\n \n10                                        \n \nsecurity eligibility or trustworthiness. . . .\u201d  The Appeal Board has cogently explained the \nprocess for analyzing falsification cases, stating: \n  \n(a) when a falsification allegation is controverted, Department Counsel has \nthe burden of proving falsification; (b) proof of an omission, standing alone, \ndoes not establish or prove an applicant\u2019s intent or state of mind when the \nomission occurred; and (c) a Judge must consider the record evidence as \na whole to determine whether there is direct or circumstantial evidence \nconcerning the applicant\u2019s intent or state of mind at the time the omission \noccurred. [Moreover], it was legally permissible for the Judge to conclude \nDepartment Counsel had established a prima facie case under Guideline E \nand the burden of persuasion had shifted to the applicant to present \nevidence to explain the omission.  \n \nISCR Case No. 03-10380 at 5 (App. Bd. Jan. 6, 2006) (citing ISCR Case No. 02-23133 \n(App. Bd. June 9, 2004)). \n \nApplicant failed to disclose that he did not timely file his federal income tax return \nfor tax year 2013 on his March 18, 2016 SCA. He read the question and provided \ncomments related to his state tax return for tax year 2011. He did not overlook the tax-\nrelated questions, and he did not answer them to the best of his ability. He did not give a \ncredible explanation for his failure to disclose this failure to timely file his 2013 federal \nincome tax return and that he had a delinquent federal income tax debt. SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a and \n2.b and AG \u00b6 16(a) are established. \n \nAG \u00b6 17 provides seven conditions that could mitigate security concerns in this \ncase: \n \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was caused \nor significantly contributed to by advice of legal counsel or of a person with \nprofessional responsibilities for advising or instructing the individual \nspecifically concerning security processes. Upon being made aware of the \nrequirement to cooperate or provide the information, the individual \ncooperated fully and truthfully; \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to \nrecur; \n\n \n11                                        \n \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability \nto exploitation, manipulation, or duress; \n \n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable \nreliability; and \n \n(g) association with persons involved in criminal activities was unwitting, \nhas ceased, or occurs under circumstances that do not cast doubt upon the \nindividual's reliability, trustworthiness, judgment, or willingness to comply \nwith rules and regulations. \n   \nApplicant deliberately and improperly failed to disclose the scope of his tax \nproblems on his March 18, 2016 SCA. This falsification by intentionally failing to disclose \nthe existence and magnitude of his tax problem was serious, improper, and raised a \nsecurity concern. No mitigating conditions apply. Personal conduct security concerns are \nnot mitigated.   \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), \u201c[t]he ultimate determination\u201d of whether to grant a security \nclearance \u201cmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines\u201d and the whole-person concept. My comments under Guidelines F and \nE are incorporated in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under those guidelines but some warrant additional comment. \n \nApplicant is a 38-year-old information assurance security officer or a cybersecurity \nanalyst for a defense contractor. He attended college for one year. He has two children \nages five and nine. His only unemployment in the last five years was for five or six months \nin 2018 to 2019.   \n \nApplicant filed his 2011 federal income tax return in March 2018, his 2013 federal \nand state income tax returns in May 2018, and his 2015 federal and state income tax \nreturns in March 2018. He has had delinquent federal income taxes for several years. He \nis currently making payments to address a federal income tax debt for tax year 2012. His \n\n \n12                                        \n \nstate and federal income tax debts are in established payment plans that are acceptable \nto the state and IRS. \n \nThe Appeal Board\u2019s emphasis on security concerns arising from tax cases is \ninstructive and binding on administrative judges. See ISCR Case No. 14-05794 at 7 (App. \nBd. July 7, 2016) (reversing grant of security clearance and stating, \u201cHis delay in taking \naction to resolve his tax deficiency for years and then taking action only after his security \nclearance was in jeopardy undercuts a determination that Applicant has rehabilitated \nhimself and does not reflect the voluntary compliance of rules and regulations expected \nof someone entrusted with the nation\u2019s secrets.\u201d); ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 2-6 (App. \nBd. Aug. 18, 2015) (reversing grant of a security clearance, discussing lack of detailed \ncorroboration of circumstances beyond applicant\u2019s control adversely affecting finances, \nnoting two tax liens totaling $175,000 and garnishment of Applicant\u2019s wages, and \nemphasizing the applicant\u2019s failure to timely file and pay taxes); ISCR Case No. 12-05053 \nat 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 30, 2014) (reversing grant of a security clearance, noting not all tax \nreturns filed, and insufficient discussion of Applicant\u2019s efforts to resolve tax liens).  \n \nMore recently, in ISCR Case No. 14-05476 (App. Bd. Mar. 25, 2016) the Appeal \nBoard reversed a grant of a security clearance for a retired E-9 and cited his failure to \ntimely file state tax returns for tax years 2010 through 2013 and federal returns for tax \nyears 2010 through 2012. Before the retired E-9\u2019s hearing, he filed his tax returns and \npaid his tax debts except for $13,000, which was in an established payment plan. The \nAppeal Board highlighted his annual income of over $200,000 and discounted his non-\ntax expenses, contributions to DOD, expenditures for his children\u2019s college tuition and \nexpenses, and spouse\u2019s serious medical and mental health problems. The Appeal Board \nemphasized \u201cthe allegations regarding his failure to file tax returns in the first place stating, \nit is well settled that failure to file tax returns suggest that an applicant has a problem with \ncomplying with well-established government rules and systems. Voluntary compliance \nwith such rules and systems is essential for protecting classified information.\u201d Id. at 5 \n(citing ISCR Case No. 01-05340 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 20, 2002) (internal quotation marks \nand brackets omitted)). See also ISCR Case No. 14-03358 at 3, 5 (App. Bd. Oct. 9, 2015) \n(reversing grant of a security clearance, noting $150,000 owed to the federal government, \nand stating \u201cA security clearance represents an obligation to the Federal Government for \nthe protection of national secrets. Accordingly failure to honor other obligations to the \nGovernment has a direct bearing on an applicant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability \nto protect classified information.\u201d).  \n \nThe primary problem here relates to Applicant\u2019s handling of his federal and state \nincome taxes and his failure to honestly answer questions on his SCA. Applicant knew \nthat he needed to timely file his federal and state income tax returns. He had a legal \nrequirement to timely file his tax returns and pay his taxes. His actions under the Appeal \nBoard jurisprudence are too little, too late to fully mitigate security concerns. Applicant\u2019s \nfailure to \u201csatisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack \nof judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about [his] reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or \nsensitive information.\u201d AG \u00b6 16. \n \n\n \n13                                        \n \nApplicant failed to disclose his delinquent federal income tax debt and his failure \nto timely file his federal tax returns for tax years 2011 and 2013 and his state tax returns \nfor tax year 2013 on his March 18, 2016 SCA. His falsification of his March 18, 2016 SCA \noccurred in a security context, and it raises a serious security concern. The protection of \nnational security relies on applicants to self-report conduct that jeopardizes security, even \nwhen that disclosure might damage the applicant\u2019s career. Applicant cannot be trusted to \ndisclose potentially derogatory information. He did not establish his reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information. \n \nIt is well settled that once a concern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s security \nclearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption against granting a security clearance. \nSee Dorfmont, 913 F. 2d at 1401. I have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Egan, \nExec. Or. 10865, the Directive, the AGs, and the Appeal Board\u2019s jurisprudence to the \nfacts and circumstances in the context of the whole person. Unmitigated financial \nconsiderations and personal conduct security concerns lead me to conclude that grant of \na security clearance to Applicant is not warranted at this time.   \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n  \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT  \n \nSubparagraph 1.a: \n \n \n  \nAgainst Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT  \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a and 2.b: \n \n  \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s \neligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n_________________________ \nMark Harvey \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Based upon a review of the pleadings and exhibits, \nnational security eligibility for access to classified information is denied.  \nStatement of Case \nOn April 30, 2018, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued Applicant a Statement \nof Reasons (SOR), detailing security concerns under Guideline F (Financial \nConsiderations). Applicant answered the SOR on June 25, 2018, and requested his case \nbe decided by an administrative judge on the written record without a hearing (Answer). \nOn July 27, 2018, Department Counsel submitted the Government\u2019s written case. A \ncomplete copy of the File of Relevant Material (FORM), containing five Items, was mailed \nto Applicant on August 2, 2018, and received by him on August 16, 2018. The FORM \nnotified Applicant that he had an opportunity to file objections and submit material in \nrefutation, extenuation, or mitigation within 30 days of receipt of the FORM. Applicant did \nnot submit a response to the FORM or object to the Government\u2019s evidence. Items 1 \n02/11/2019\n\n \n \n2 \n \n \nthrough 5 are admitted into evidence without objection. The Defense Office of Hearings \nand Appeals (DOHA) assigned this case to me on December 13, 2018.  \n \nFindings of Fact  \n \n \nApplicant admitted the seven delinquent debts alleged in the SOR. (Item 1) His \nadmissions are incorporated into these findings. \n \n \nApplicant is 46 years old, a high school graduate, and never married. He has three \nchildren. He lives with his girlfriend. In January 2013, he began a position with a defense \ncontractor. In June 2016, he submitted a security clearance application (SCA). (Item 2) \n \n \nBased on credit bureau reports (CBR) from August 2016, and January 2018, the \nSOR alleged seven debts that became delinquent between 2010 and 2016, and totaled \n$173,885. They included an automobile repossession, an unpaid credit card, two \ndelinquent time-share debts Applicant purchased in 2006, an unpaid cell phone bill, and \ntwo delinquent student loans that he co-signed for his sister. (Items 4 and 5) \n \n \nIn September 2017, prior to the issuance of the April 2018 SOR, a government \ninvestigator interviewed Applicant about his delinquent debts. Applicant stated that he \nwas no longer responsible for his sister\u2019s student loans. He said he had been paying the \ndelinquent credit card for a period of time, but then fell behind. He thought the time-share \ndebts were resolved because he no longer heard from the person who sold them to him \nand his girlfriend. He indicated that he was working with the cell phone company to \nresolve its debt. He said he was still making payments on it. He stated that he had not \nparticipated in credit counseling. (Item 3) \n \n \nIn his Answer, Applicant explained that he fell behind on his debts in 2016 after he \nwas hospitalized for two to three weeks. He also noted that he was unable to pay all of \nhis debts because his hours were reduced, and he was not working overtime at his last \njob. (Item 1) \n \n \nApplicant did not include any evidence confirming his assertions that he was no \nlonger responsible for the student loans or timeshares, or that any of the other debts had \nbeen resolved. He did not provide a current budget or other information related to his \nfinancial status from which to determine his current financial reliability or his ability to pay \nthe large debts.  \n \nPolicies \n \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines for \n\n \n \n3 \n \n \nDetermining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive \nPosition (AG), effective within the DOD on June 8, 2017. \n \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the pertinent AG. In addition to brief introductory \nexplanations of the security concern, the guidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions \nand mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s national \nsecurity eligibility. \n \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere speculation or \nconjecture.  \n \n \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14 requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \n \n \nA person applying for national security eligibility seeks to enter into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants national \nsecurity eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as \nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or sensitive information.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n4 \n \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \n \n \nThe security concerns relating to the guideline for financial considerations are set \nout in AG \u00b6 18, which reads in pertinent part:       \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personal security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might \nknowingly compromise classified information in order to raise money. It \nencompasses concerns about an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and \nother qualities essential to protecting classified information. An individual \nwho is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, unconcerned, or \nnegligent in handling and safeguarding classified information.1 \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 19 describes two conditions that could raise security concerns and may be \ndisqualifying in this case:  \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.  \n \nBased on his admissions and CBRs, Applicant has a history of being unable to \nmeet financial obligations, which began in 2010 and continues into the present. The \nevidence raises security concerns under the above disqualifying conditions, and shifts the \nburden to Applicant to rebut, extenuate, or mitigate those concerns.  \n \n \nThe guideline includes conditions in AG \u00b6 20 that could mitigate security concerns \narising from Applicant\u2019s financial problems. Five are potentially applicable: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n                                                 \n1 See ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \n\n \n \n5 \n \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debt; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue \n \n \nThere is insufficient record evidence to establish full mitigation under any of the \nabove mitigating conditions. The seven delinquent debts alleged in the SOR arose \nbetween 2010 and 2016 and remain unresolved. The evidence does not establish \nmitigation under AG \u00b6 20 (a). Applicant attributed his financial problems to a \nhospitalization and reduction of work hours in 2016, which were circumstances beyond \nhis control. However, that situation does not address delinquent debts that arose prior to \n2016. He did not provide evidence that he attempted to responsibly manage his financial \nobligations. AG \u00b6 20(b) partially applies. There is no evidence that Applicant participated \nin credit or financial counseling, and that his delinquent debts are being resolved and are \nunder control. AG \u00b6 20(c) does not apply. He did not provide evidence that he has made-\ngood faith efforts to repay or resolve any debts. AG \u00b6 20(d) does not apply. Although \nAppellant said he is no longer responsible for some debts, he did not submit evidence to \nprove his assertions and establish mitigation under AG \u00b6 20(e). \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s national security eligibility by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct \nand all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \n\n \n \n6 \n \n \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national \nsecurity eligibility must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the applicable guidelines and the whole-person concept. \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \npertinent facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 \n2(d) were addressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \n \n  \nApplicant is a mature individual, who has been working for a defense contractor \nsince 2013. During a September 2017 background interview, he discussed his delinquent \ndebts. In the April 2018 SOR, the Government placed him on notice that his debts raised \nsecurity concerns. After reviewing his Answer to the SOR, Department Counsel notified \nhim in the FORM that he failed to submit sufficient documentation to address the status \nof the debts and to mitigate the financial allegations. Despite that notice, he did not \nprovide evidence to confirm that he had resolved any of the debts, including the large \nstudent loans totaling over $148,000. At this time, he has failed to present evidence of \nmitigation, including a track record of responsibly managing debts and financial \nobligations. He failed to meet his burden to mitigate the security concerns arising under \nthe guideline for financial considerations. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n       AGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.g:  \n    Against Applicant \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant access to classified \ninformation. National security eligibility is denied. \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSHARI DAM \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Eligibility for access to classified information is \ndenied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application on January 23, 2017. On \nAugust 31, 2018, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility (DOD \nCAF) sent him a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging security concerns under \nGuidelines G and J. The DOD CAF acted under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) \npromulgated in Security Executive Agent Directive 4, National Security Adjudicative \nGuidelines (December 10, 2016). \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on September 19, 2018, and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge. Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR included 16 pages \n\n \n2 \n \ncaptioned as \u201cself-reflection,\u201d containing his introspective personal evaluation of the \nimpact of alcohol consumption on his life, followed by favorable comments from several \nfriends and former colleagues who read it.  \n \nDepartment Counsel was ready to proceed on March 7, 2019, and the case was \nassigned to me on April 4, 2019. On May 3, 2019, the Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals (DOHA) notified Applicant that the hearing was scheduled for May 23, 2019. I \nconvened the hearing as scheduled. Government Exhibits (GX) 1 through 3 were \nadmitted in evidence without objection. Applicant testified, presented the testimony of five \nwitnesses, and submitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AX) A through M, which were admitted \nwithout objection. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on June 5, 2019. \n \nFindings of Fact1 \n \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he admitted the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.g. \nHe did not specifically admit or deny the allegation in SOR \u00b6 2.a, which cross-alleges the \nconduct in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.c, and 1.f. His admissions in his answer and at the hearing are \nincorporated in my findings of fact.  \n \n \nApplicant is a 29-year-old cybersecurity analyst employed by a defense contractor. \nHe was a part-time bartender from August 2006 to May 2015, and he also worked part-\ntime in construction and home-cleaning services from June 2006 to January 2013. He \nreceived an associate\u2019s degree in May 2015. Shortly thereafter, he began working for a \ndefense contractor as a help-desk technician. In October 2017, he began working in his \ncurrent position. He has held a security clearance since December 2015. \n \n \nApplicant has never married and has no children. He has lived with a cohabitant \nand her three children since June 2017. (Tr. 95-96.)  \n \n \nIn January 2013, Applicant was stopped by a state trooper for speeding (60 miles \nper hour in a 45-mile-per-hour zone). Applicant had consumed three or four beers. He \ntestified that a regular beer for him was a 22-ounce draft beer. (Tr. 98.) He failed a field \nsobriety test and a breathalyzer registered a blood-alcohol content (BAC) of 0.12. (Tr. \n100.) He was arrested for driving under the influence of alcohol (DUI). On advice of his \nattorney, he attended an alcohol-education class before his court appearance. He could \nnot remember receiving any diagnosis after the class, but he remembered that he was \nadvised to modify his consumption. He followed that advice to the extent that he stopped \ndrinking hard liquor and limited himself to beer. (Tr. 101-02.) He pleaded guilty and was \nsentenced to probation before judgment, confinement for 20 days (suspended), and a \n$185 fine. He was placed on probation for three years, until June 2016. (GX 3 at 1-2.) \n \n \nIn October 2015, Applicant was stopped by a state trooper for crossing the white \nline on the edge of the road. He had consumed four or five beers. He was detained for \n                                                          \n1 Applicant\u2019s personal information is extracted from his security clearance application (GX 1) unless \notherwise indicated by a parenthetical citation to the record. \n\n \n3 \n \nabout an hour until he was released to his brother\u2019s custody. He remembered that a \nbreathalyzer at the police station registered a BAC of 0.20. (Tr. 106.) The charges were \ndismissed pursuant to a plea agreement requiring him to make a $5,000 charitable \ncontribution, undergo a 28-day treatment program, and install an ignition interlock on his \nvehicle. (GX 2 at 8; Tr. 107.) His treatment consisted of 54 group sessions and 4 individual \nsessions. He was diagnosed with a severe alcohol-use disorder. He completed the \nprogram in November 2015. The treatment facility recommended that he abstain from \nalcohol, complete an intensive outpatient addiction-counseling program, attend \nAlcoholics Anonymous (AA) or equivalent meetings a minimum of three times a week, \nand obtain a male AA sponsor. Applicant abstained from alcohol for about two or three \nmonths, but he did not follow any of the other recommendations. (Tr. 110.) \n \n \nIn June 2018, Applicant was stopped by city police for driving without his headlights \nturned on. He had spent the day on a beach vacation with his cohabitant and her sisters, \nand had consumed several beers throughout the day. He was arrested for DUI. (GX 3 at \n3-4.) His interim clearance was revoked on September 4, 2018. (SOR Answer at 16.) His \ntrial was pending when the SOR was issued. In December 2018, he entered an \u201cAlford \nplea,\u201d which does not admit guilt but admits that the prosecutor has sufficient evidence to \nprove guilt. (Tr. 113.) He was fined $600 and sentenced to 11 days in jail. He served four \ndays and received a work release. He is required to have an ignition interlock on his \nvehicle until July 3, 2019. (AX M at 2; Tr. 116-17.) \n \n \nApplicant testified that after his arrest in June 2018, he went home, consumed half \na beer, and decided to stop drinking. He testified that he has not consumed alcohol since \nJune 22, 2018. (Tr. 115.) \n \n \nIn July 2018, Applicant entered a 12-week substance-abuse treatment program \nthat included weekly breathalyzer tests and random urinalysis screening. As of \nSeptember 24, 2018, his prognosis was \u201cgood.\u201d (AX E.) He completed the program in \nOctober 2018. (Tr. 124.) \n \n \nApplicant began attending AA meetings on the day he was released from jail in \nJune 2018. He attended meetings daily for 60 days. He then began attending meetings \nthree times a week and calling his sponsor daily. He did not attend meetings or talk to his \nsponsor for about six weeks in February-March 2019, but he has resumed meetings and \ntalks to his sponsor about once a week. (Tr. 118-22.) His sponsor submitted a letter \nexpressing confidence in his continued sobriety and recovery. (AX F.) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s mother and stepfather submitted a joint statement, and his mother \ntestified at the hearing. She testified that for many years they had little contact with \nApplicant, even though they are a large and socially active family and underwent several \nhealth emergencies. They witnessed his drinking binges and his hangovers. Since June \n2018, Applicant has attended all family functions, he calls his mother daily, and his attitude \nand temperament has changed. He no longer is involved in the bar and restaurant \nbusiness and no longer indulges in the heavy drinking after work that was common when \nhe was working as a bartender. (Tr. 24-32; AX B.) \n\n \n4 \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s cohabitant submitted a statement and testified. She and Applicant have \nknown each other for about 13 years and both worked at the same bar and restaurant. \nThey became friends and now live together. She has a security clearance and is the \nassistant facility security officer for a defense contractor. She testified that Applicant is a \nkind and generous person and a talented and dedicated employee. She has watched him \nattend AA meetings and listened to him talking to his sponsor. She believes he has a \nstrong support system, including herself, his mother, stepfather, brother, colleagues, \nmany friends, and his AA sponsor. She was present when Applicant returned from work \nafter his most recent arrest and said, \u201cI can\u2019t do this anymore. This is going to destroy my \nlife.\u201d She testified that she has observed Applicant at events where alcohol was being \nserved, and he has seemed comfortable limiting himself to non-alcoholic drinks. She \nbelieves that he has been abstinent since June 22, 2018. (AX D; Tr. 34-46.) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s aunt, a recently retired federal employee with 33 years of service, \nregards herself as his \u201cfavorite aunt.\u201d She testified that Applicant comes from a large, \nstrong family that supports his decision to overcome his alcohol problems. She testified \nthat the family gathers almost every month for a special occasion, and alcohol is served \nat these gatherings. Applicant has attended every gathering, and he has not consumed \nalcohol at any of them. (Tr. 58-66.) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s supervisor when the June 2018 incident occurred testified that he was \nnotified when Applicant was arrested. His former supervisor changed jobs in August 2018, \nmoving from being the contractor lead to being the government lead. He was impressed \nby Applicant when he was the contractor lead and continued to be impressed when he \nbecame the government lead. He and Applicant have become personal friends. They \nrecently traveled to a job location, and most of the contractor employees and government \nemployees went out for the evening after work, but Applicant asked to be dropped off for \nan AA meeting in the area. (Tr. 78-85.) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s supervisor since August 2018 testified and submitted a statement. She \ntestified that she and Applicant work together daily, and she has had the opportunity to \nknow him on a personal level. She testified that Applicant has been very open about his \nproblem with alcohol and his steps to overcome it. Applicant is under consideration for \npromotion based on his technical skill, leadership, and overall performance. She admires \nhim for his decision to seek help, complete treatment, and commit to sobriety. She \nbelieves Applicant is qualified for a security clearance. (AX A; Tr. 68-77.) \n \n \nThree family members (his father, an uncle, and a cousin) submitted letters \nattesting to Applicant\u2019s good character and dedication to overcoming his alcohol \nproblems, and one of them suggested that alcohol abuse was a family problem. (AX I, J, \nand K.) A former co-worker and a current co-worker regard him as hardworking, focused, \nand passionate about his job. (AX G and H.)  \n \n \n \n\n \n5 \n \nPolicies \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2.  \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \n \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr.20, 2016).   \n \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \n\n \n6 \n \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \n \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption \n \n \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant was arrested for DUI in January 2013 and was \nconvicted (SOR \u00b6 1.a); received treatment for alcohol abuse in February 2013 (SOR \u00b6 \n1.b); was arrested for DUI in September 2015 (SOR \u00b6 1.c); and received treatment in \nOctober 2015 for a diagnosis of a severe alcohol-use disorder (SOR \u00b6 1.d). It also alleges \nthat he continued to use alcohol from November 2015 to June 2018, contrary to treatment \nrecommendations (SOR \u00b6 1.e); was arrested for DUI in June 2018 (SOR \u00b6 1.f); and was \nenrolled in a 12-week treatment program beginning in July 2018 (SOR \u00b6 1.g).  \n \n \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 21: \u201cExcessive alcohol \nconsumption often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment or the failure to control \nimpulses, and can raise questions about an individual's reliability and trustworthiness.\u201d \nThe relevant disqualifying conditions are: \n \nAG \u00b6 22(a): alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while \nunder the influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, \nor other incidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the individual's \nalcohol use or whether the individual has been diagnosed with alcohol use \ndisorder; \n \nAG \u00b6 22(c): habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired \njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed with alcohol \nuse disorder; \n \nAG \u00b6 22(d): diagnosis by a duly qualified medical or mental health \nprofessional (e.g., physician, clinical psychologist, psychiatrist, or licensed \nclinical social worker) of alcohol use disorder; \n \nAG \u00b6 22(e): the failure to follow treatment advice once diagnosed; and \n \nAG \u00b6 22(f): alcohol consumption, which is not in accordance with treatment \nrecommendations, after a diagnosis of alcohol use disorder. \n \n \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 22(a) and 22(c) are established by Applicant\u2019s arrests for DUI in January \n2013, September 2015, and June 2018. AG \u00b6\u00b6 22(d), 22(e), and 22(f) are established by \n\n \n7 \n \nhis treatment in October 2015, a diagnosis of severe alcohol-use disorder in November \n2015, and his continued alcohol consumption, contrary to a treatment recommendation \nthat he abstain from alcohol. \n \n \nThe following mitigating conditions under this guideline are potentially applicable: \n \nAG \u00b6 23(a): so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, \nor it happened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur \nor does not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, \nor judgment; \n \nAG \u00b6 23(b): the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive \nalcohol use, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, \nand has demonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified \nconsumption \nor \nabstinence \nin \naccordance \nwith \ntreatment \nrecommendations; and \n \nAG \u00b6 23(d): the individual has successfully completed a treatment program \nalong with any required aftercare, and has demonstrated a clear and \nestablished pattern of modified consumption or abstinence in accordance \nwith treatment recommendations. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 23(a) is not established. Applicant\u2019s excessive alcohol consumption was \nrecent, frequent, and did not occur under unusual circumstances making recurrence \nunlikely. There are no Abright line@ rules for determining when conduct is Arecent.@ The \ndetermination must be based on a careful evaluation of all the evidence. If the evidence \nshows Aa significant period of time has passed without any evidence of misconduct,@ then \nan administrative judge must determine whether that period of time demonstrates \nAchanged circumstances or conduct sufficient to warrant a finding of reform or \nrehabilitation.@ ISCR Case No. 02-24452 at 6 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2004).  \n \nApplicant\u2019s deeply personal and introspective analysis of his conduct in his answer \nto the SOR, his testimony at the hearing, his continued and extensive participation in AA, \nand the testimonials from his AA sponsor, friends, co-workers, and family members show \nthat Applicant\u2019s epiphany was in June 2018, when he recognized for the first time that he \nhad a serious alcohol-abuse problem and began to address it. He also recognized that, \nfor the first time in his life, he had a meaningful and rewarding job, and that he would lose \nit if he did not change his lifestyle. While the possibility of relapse cannot be excluded, the \nevidence indicates that he is serious about maintaining sobriety and has taken specific \nsteps to change his behavior. However, insufficient time has passed since his last DUI to \nestablish this mitigating condition. \n \n \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 23(b) and 23(d) are not fully established. Applicant has acknowledged his \nexcessive alcohol consumption, completed a 12-week substance-abuse treatment \nprogram in October 2018, participated aggressively in AA, maintained regular contact \nwith his AA sponsor, and abstained from alcohol since June 2018. However, I am not \n\n \n8 \n \nsatisfied that sufficient time has elapsed since his last DUI to demonstrate a \u201cclear and \nestablished pattern\u201d of abstinence. \n \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct \n \nThe SOR cross-alleges the DUI arrests alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.c, and 1.f under \nthis guideline. The concern raised by criminal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 30: \u201cCriminal \nactivity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. By its \nvery nature, it calls into question a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, \nrules and regulations.\u201d  \n \nApplicant\u2019s DUI arrests and their legal consequences establish the following \ndisqualifying conditions under this guideline: \n \nAG \u00b6 31(a): a pattern of minor offenses, any one of which on its own would \nbe unlikely to affect a national security eligibility decision, but which in \ncombination cast doubt on the individual's judgment, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness; and \n \nAG \u00b6 31(b): evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted; and \n \nAG \u00b6 31(c): individual is currently on parole or probation.2 \n \nThe following mitigating conditions are relevant, but they are not established, for \nthe reasons set out in the above discussion of Guideline G:  \n \nAG \u00b6 32(a): so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior \nhappened, or it happened under such unusual circumstances, that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n \nAG \u00b6 32(d): there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not \nlimited to, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, \nrestitution, compliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or \nhigher education, good employment record, or constructive community \ninvolvement. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \n                                                          \n2 There is no evidence in the record showing that probation was specifically imposed, but the ignition \ninterlock requirement is the functional equivalent of probation for the purposes of this guideline. \n\n \n9 \n \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances and applying the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d).3  \n \n \nI have incorporated my comments under Guidelines G and J in my whole-person \nanalysis and applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). Applicant was candid, \nremorseful, sincere, and credible at the hearing. He has taken significant steps to change \nhis lifestyle. However, his abstinence since June 2018 is insufficient to overcome the \nsecurity concerns raised by his multiple DUI incidents. I am bound by the mandate of the \nSupreme Court in Egan, supra, which requires that \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations \nshould err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d \n \n \nIf Applicant continues along his current path, he may well be able to qualify for a \nsecurity clearance after more time has passed. See Directive E3.1.38 through E3.1.40 \n(reconsideration authorized after one year). However, after weighing the disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions under Guidelines G and J, and evaluating all the evidence currently \nbefore me in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the \nsecurity concerns raised by his alcohol consumption and alcohol-related criminal conduct. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline G (Alcohol Consumption): \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.g: \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline J (Criminal Conduct):  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \n                                                          \n3 The factors are: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding \nthe conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) \nthe presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for \nthe conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of \ncontinuation or recurrence.  \n \n\n \n10 \n \nConclusion \n \n \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.

Before his more recent incidents involving alcohol, Applicant\u2019s only legal infractions took place while he was an undergraduate student: a 1999 arrest leading to the charges of possession of marijuana and possession of paraphernalia and a 2000 arrest for driving under the influence (DUI) that was reduced to reckless driving. Applicant has not used marijuana again since that time, nor does he socialize with those who use it. He has not consumed alcohol to excess since November 2016, and has not had alcohol since June or July 2017. Many of Applicant\u2019s troubles began in 2010. In that year, he and his family suffered multiple devastating tragedies, including the death of his infant daughter, then his mother passed away suddenly a few weeks later. His supervisor later noted that these events led to increased alcohol use and symptoms of depression. (Ex. C) During this time he was cited for driving while intoxicated (DUI), and he was given probation before judgment. He felt the court was too lenient and, on his own initiative, he started a 12-week alcohol program as well as Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) attendance. (Tr. 21) He was not entirely satisfied",

Before his more \nrecent incidents involving alcohol, Applicant\u2019s only legal infractions took place while he \nwas an undergraduate student: a 1999 arrest leading to the charges of possession of \nmarijuana and possession of paraphernalia and a 2000 arrest for driving under the \ninfluence (DUI) that was reduced to reckless driving. Applicant has not used marijuana \nagain since that time, nor does he socialize with those who use it. He has not consumed \nalcohol to excess since November 2016, and has not had alcohol since June or July \n2017.  \n \nMany of Applicant\u2019s troubles began in 2010. In that year, he and his family \nsuffered multiple devastating tragedies, including the death of his infant daughter, then \nhis mother passed away suddenly a few weeks later. His supervisor later noted that \nthese events led to increased alcohol use and symptoms of depression. (Ex. C) During \nthis time he was cited for driving while intoxicated (DUI), and he was given probation \nbefore judgment. He felt the court was too lenient and, on his own initiative, he started a \n12-week alcohol program as well as Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) attendance. (Tr. 21) \nHe was not entirely satisfied by either effort. While he continued to imbibe, however, his \nconsumption of alcohol was reduced significantly. A period of leave from work lasting \nabout three months, along with professional counseling, proved to be effective in \nhelping Applicant refocus. (Ex. C)  \n \nAbout two years later, Applicant and his wife had a child. He became protective \nof the new baby and mindful not to drink to excess. In about November 2016, Applicant \ndrank alcoholic beverages at a friend\u2019s home. Feeling intoxicated, he spent the night at \nthe house. In the morning, he began driving home, but fell asleep at a lengthy red light. \nA concerned citizen saw him asleep and took control of his vehicle, pulling it into a fast \nfood store\u2019s parking lot.  \n \nConcerned Applicant might have been experiencing some sort of diabetic \ncondition, the citizen asked someone to call for an ambulance. When the police arrived, \nhe was ultimately arrested and charged with driving while impaired by alcohol (DWI), \nDUI, negligent driving, reckless driving, and failure to obey properly placed traffic control \ninstruments. At the time, Applicant was unaware he was legally impaired and thought he \nwas only tired. He refused a breathalyzer test because it was his understanding that \none should always do that. The arrest awakened him to the facts as they were, and he \nimmediately repented his inattentiveness and failure to self-monitor.  \n\n \n \n \n \n3 \nOn his own volition, Applicant put himself into a three-day inpatient \u201clockup\u201d \nprogram where a patient is subjected to intensive counseling all day. The experience \nwas eye-opening. After receiving a certificate for successfully completing that program, \nhe entered a second program for three months at an outpatient center. There, he found \nmuch in terms of self-discovery through batteries of tests and introspection.2 (Tr. 25)  \n \nDuring this time, Applicant also returned to AA. He learned that each meeting site \nhad its own character. After checking several of them out, he found a group that was a \ngood fit and where he learned from the stories of others. He started attending about \nthree times a week minimum. He continues attending to date, visiting the site three to \nsix times a week, \u201clike a sponge, to try to get any information I can from them.\u201d (Tr. 26) \nHe attributes his nearly two years of sobriety to these meetings, citing it as one of his \nlargest supports. (Tr. 26) He is also supported by his family, who is expecting a new \nbaby within a couple of months. In addition, he has his own personal desire and \nconviction to be free from future trouble involving alcohol. Finally, Applicant and his \nfamily are becoming increasingly active with their church. Having had his probation \nabated early and with a support structure in place, he now feels he is on his way to \nstarting over. (Ex. 7) \n \nApplicant told his supervisor in November 2016 that he had suffered a relapse \nand had actively resumed counseling. He has been open about his issues at work, \nwhere his career has been flourishing. With AA still an integral part of his life and while \nmaintain healthy sobriety, Applicant finds he is much more productive at home. He \nnoted that \u201ceverything with [his] wife and child has been a million times better.\u201d (Tr. 35) \nLiving without alcohol has brought him closer to his wife, now that time away from home \nat friends\u2019 homes for barbeques or sports is now spent as a family unit.  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. They are applied in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto the AG, the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known \nas the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. The AG \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \n                                                          \n2 Applicant believed he was medically given the diagnosis of alcohol abuse, but does not dispute the \nSOR\u2019s notation that he was found to be alcohol dependent. (Tr. 28-29) \n\n \n \n \n \n4 \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder the Directive, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. In addition, an applicant is responsible for \npresenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts \nadmitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel and has the ultimate burden of \npersuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours. The Government reposes a high degree of \ntrust and confidence in those granted access to classified information. Decisions \ninclude, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the applicant may deliberately or \ninadvertently fail to safeguard such information. Decisions shall be in terms of the \nnational interest and do not question the loyalty of an applicant.  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline G - Alcohol Consumption \n \nThe Alcohol Consumption guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 21:  \n \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about \nan individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness.  \n \nWhile Applicant had no atypical experimentation or trouble with alcohol in school, \nhe had two serious alcohol-related incidents as an adult. In 2010, Applicant was cited \nfor drinking and driving while grieving the recent loss of both his infant child and mother. \nThe 2016 DUI-related incident was ironically the result of his poor assessment of his \nfaculties after responsibly spending the night at a friend\u2019s home following an evening of \nimbibing. Given these facts, the following Disqualifying Conditions are applicable under \nAG \u00b6 22:  \n \nAG \u00b6 22(a): alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving \nwhile under the influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the \npeace, or other incidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the \nindividual\u2019s alcohol use or whether the individual has been diagnosed with \nalcohol use disorder; and \n \nAG \u00b6 22(c): habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of \nimpaired judgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed with \nalcohol use disorder. \n \n\n \n \n \n \n5 \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially available under AG \u00b6 23:  \n \nAG \u00b6 23(b): the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive \nalcohol use, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, \nand has established a clear and established pattern of modified \nconsumption \nor \nabstinence \nin \naccordance \nwith \ntreatment \nrecommendations; and \n \nAG \u00b6 23(d): the individual has successfully completed a treatment \nprogram along with any required aftercare, and has demonstrated a clear \nand established pattern of modified consumption or abstinence in \naccordance with treatment recommendations.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s first arrest for DUI in 2010 came at a time of tremendous loss, \nunderstandable depression, and grief. While those conditions do not absolve Applicant \nof his conduct, they do help explain how a mature man might find his judgment lapsed \nand his control temporarily abandoned. When he was given a lighter sentence than he \nbelieved he deserved, he sought additional counseling, including some time with AA.  \n \nA lapse in 2016 found Applicant harder on himself for his poor judgment than the \njudicial system. He knew he had failed to control his own actions. On his own volition, \nhe self-admitted to a three-day \u201clockup\u201d counseling facility, followed by an extended \noutpatient treatment facility, both of which he successfully completed. It was at this time \nhe returned to AA. This time, however, he actively searched for a meeting site with \nwhich he felt more comfortable.  \n \nOnce found, Applicant thrived in what he considers to be a learning environment \nwhere he learns from the stories of others. Today, he continues with AA meetings three \nor more times a week, finds solace in church attendance, and support at home and \nwork. Today, he relishes his life as a family man and looks forward to the upcoming \nbirth of another child. He has not consumed alcohol to excess since the November 2016 \nincident, and, with the on-going support of AA, has successfully maintained sobriety \nsince the summer of 2017. Consequently, I find AG \u00b6 23(b) and AG \u00b6 23(d) apply. \n \nGuideline J \u2013 Criminal Conduct \n \n \nThe concern raised by criminal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 30:  \n \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person's ability \nor willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations. \n \nApplicant admits he was arrested in college for possession of marijuana and \npossession of paraphernalia. He also admits that in college he was also arrested for \nDUI, an arrest that resulted in a conviction for reckless driving. Since his youth, he was \narrested and charged with DUI in 2010 and for DWI, DUI, negligent driving, reckless \n\n \n \n \n \n6 \ndriving, and failure to properly obey placed traffic control device in 2016. Probation for \nthe latter incident has been curtailed. Such facts raise disqualifying condition:  \n \nAG \u00b6 31(b): evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, \nan admission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, \nregardless of whether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or \nconvicted.  \n \n \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially relevant:   \n \nAG \u00b6 32(a): so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior \nhappened, or it happened under such unusual circumstances, that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment, and \n \nAG \u00b6 32(d): there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not \nlimited to, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, \nrestitution, compliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or \nhigher education, good employment record, or constructive community \ninvolvement.   \n \n \nApplicant has not used marijuana again since he was an undergraduate student \nin the 1990s. He does not associate with those who do use the drug. As noted in the \npreceding section, he is no longer suffering from an alcohol disorder, having grown to \ncut alcohol from his life with reliance on an extensive support network. Meanwhile, his \nhome life has improved and his professional work has shown growth. Therefore, I find \nAG \u00b6 32(d) applies. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, one must evaluate security clearance eligibility \nby considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances. \nConsideration shall be given to the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a). \nThe final determination must be an overall commonsense judgment based on careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case, and conducted a whole-person \nanalysis based on the record. In addition to Applicant\u2019s past alcohol issues and criminal \nconduct I considered his present life, candor at the hearing, and credible explanations. \n \nApplicant is a 40-year-old chemist who has earned a bachelor\u2019s degree. He has \nworked for the same employer for 13 years. He is highly regarded at work by his \nsuperiors and peers, as well as within his community. He is married, has a preteen \nchild, and is expecting a baby shortly. He first used alcohol as a teen. In college, he was \narrested for possession of marijuana and possession of paraphernalia, and charged \n\n \n \n \n \n7 \nwith DUI, although he was found guilty of a lesser offense. He has not used marijuana \nsince that time. Issues with alcohol, however, have recurred.  \n \nIn 2010, Applicant was in grief over the loss of his infant child and mother, and \nsuffered from related periods of depression. He imbibed, drove, and was charged with \nDUI. Given probation before judgment and what he considered to be light treatment, he \nsought additional treatment and attended AA. Neither effort, however, seemed \nadequate. In 2016, he responsibly spent the night at a friend\u2019s house after imbibing. He \nmisjudged his condition in the morning, however, and was again arrested for and \ncharged with DUI, DWI, and related charges while driving home.  \n \nTaking full responsibility for his poor judgment and failure to better self-monitor, \nApplicant sought out, attended, and completed a more satisfactory substance abuse \nprogram. More importantly, he took the time to find an AA site where he could truly \nbenefit. He found a good fit and has continued to attend three or more meetings a week, \nand transitioned from being a cautious imbiber to alcohol-free. Today, AA and his \nchurch are cornerstones of his sobriety network, enhanced by the support of his family \nand colleagues. In anticipation of a new addition to their family, he looks forward to \ndevoting time to his family, rather than drinking with friends during his free time.   \n \nApplicant\u2019s testimony and demeanor was highly credible. This is especially true \nwith regard to his description off AA, the importance of finding a meeting site or sites \nthat are a good fit for the individual, and is recommitment to his faith. He takes full \nresponsibility for his past poor judgment. He has both the motivation and the support \nnetwork to maintain his current caution with regard to alcohol. I have no genuine \nconcerns Applicant will fail to continue on his current path. I find Applicant mitigated \nsecurity concerns under Guideline G and Guideline J. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline G:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1e: \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline J:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.b: \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n8 \n \n \n \n \n \n     Conclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant a security clearance. \nEligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nArthur E.

Applicant responded to the SOR on October 19, 2018, and requested a \nhearing before an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on January 11, \n2019.  \n \nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing \non January 24, 2019, scheduling the hearing for March 6, 2019. The hearing was \nconvened as scheduled. Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 4 were admitted in \nevidence without objection. Applicant testified and submitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AE) A \nthrough Q, which were admitted without objection. The record was held open until May \n13, 2019, and extended at Applicant\u2019s request to June 4, 2019, for Applicant to submit \n\n \n2 \n \nadditional information. He submitted documents that I have marked AE R through T and \nadmitted without objection. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is a 49-year-old chief executive officer (CEO) and owner of a company \ndoing business as a subcontractor for a defense contractor. He is a high school \ngraduate. He is divorced with one child.1 \n \n \nApplicant was president and owner of a company from 1996 to 2007; he was \nCEO and owner of another company from 2007 to 2015; and he has been the CEO of \nhis current company since 2015.2 \n \n \nApplicant developed financial problems, which he attributed to loss of business \nafter the attacks on 9/11, the financial crisis and recession in the later 2000s that \naffected his business, and his 2010 divorce. He did not pay his federal and state income \ntaxes and other debts.3 \n \n \nApplicant owes the IRS for tax years 2002, 2003, 2004, 2008, and 2010. The \ntaxes owed for 2002 through 2004 are civil penalties from when Applicant failed to pay \nthe taxes that were withheld from his employees\u2019 paychecks. He stated that he could \nnot keep his employees working and also pay the taxes, so he decided not to pay the \ntaxes.4 \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s adjusted gross income for 2010 was $171,420; his tax liability was \n$34,986; and his only payment was $4,987, which was paid on April 15, 2011. As of \nSeptember 2016, with penalties and interest, he owed the IRS $56,536 for 2010. It is \nunclear how much he owes the IRS in total, but Applicant estimated his federal tax debt \nat $400,000. In May 2015, the IRS temporarily closed the collection case, having \ndetermined that Applicant did not have the ability to pay the amount owed. The IRS \ninformed him that he still owed the money, and penalties and interest would continue to \naccrue. In August 2018, the IRS determined that the account was again considered \ncollectible.5  \n \n \nIn April 2017, the IRS transferred $2,272 from what would have been a refund for \ntax year 2016 to Applicant\u2019s civil penalty for 2002. Applicant owed the IRS for tax year \n2017, but he made three payments totaling $6,954 between August 2018 and October \n4, 2018, to pay all the taxes owed for that year. Applicant is working on an offer in \n                                                          \n1 Tr. at 39-40, 79-80; GE 1, 2. \n \n2 Tr. at 40; GE 1, 2; AE P. \n \n3 Tr. at 23-24, 30, 33-34, 39, 70-72; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1-3; AE I. \n \n4 Tr. at 24-30, 33, 42, 91-94; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1, 4; AE A, B, I. \n \n5 Tr. at 24-30, 55; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1, 4; AE A, B, I. \n \n\n \n3 \n \ncompromise with the IRS. As of the close of the record on June 4, 2019, there was no \nagreement in place.6 \n \n \nApplicant and his state entered a payment agreement in August 2018, in which \nApplicant agreed to pay $851 per month for 60 months for the balance due of $44,533. \nHe established that he made payments and reduced the balance to $39,726 as of \nFebruary 2019.7 \n \n \nIn addition to the unpaid federal and state taxes, The SOR alleges three \ndelinquent debts totaling $18,576 and an unpaid $10,709 judgment. Applicant \nestablished that he paid the $5,718 (SOR \u00b6 1.d) and $5,682 (SOR \u00b6 1.e) debts in April \nand May 2018. The creditor for the $7,176 debt (SOR \u00b6 1.c) issued an IRS form 1099-C \n(Cancellation of Debt) in 2015, forgiving the debt. Applicant settled the judgment in \nOctober 2018 for $10,709 (SOR \u00b6 1.f), payable in ten monthly payments of $1,079. \nApplicant established that he made payments pursuant to the agreement.8 \n \nApplicant called a neighbor as a witness who testified that he is honest and \ndiligent. Applicant stated that he deeply cares about his service to this country, and that \nhe hopes he can continue to serve it. He asserted that regardless of the decision in this \ncase, he \u201cwill, of course, take care of [his] financial obligations as [he has] always \ndone.\u201d9 \n \nPolicies \n \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \n                                                          \n6 Tr. at 35-37, 42; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 4; AE I, J, R. \n \n7 Tr. at 37, 64; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 3; AE C, I, K. \n \n8 Tr. at 35, 38, 67, 73-78, 91; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 2; AE D-I, L-N, Q. \n \n9 Tr. at 99-104; AE R. \n\n \n4 \n \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \n  \nAnalysis \n \n \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18:       \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  \n\n \n5 \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \n \nApplicant has a history of financial problems, including unpaid taxes, judgments, \nand delinquent debts. The evidence is sufficient to raise the above disqualifying \nconditions.  \n \n  \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts;  \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue; and \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n \n \nApplicant attributed his financial problems to loss of business after the attacks on \n9/11, the financial crisis and recession in the later 2000s that affected his business, and \nhis 2010 divorce. Those conditions were beyond his control. His tax issues were not \nbeyond his control. \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \nFailure to comply with tax laws suggests that an applicant has a problem with \nabiding by well-established government rules and systems. Voluntary compliance with \nrules and systems is essential for protecting classified information. See, e.g., ISCR \nCase No. 16-01726 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 28, 2018). A person who fails repeatedly to fulfill \nhis or her legal obligations, such as paying taxes when due, does not demonstrate the \nhigh degree of good judgment and reliability required of those granted access to \nclassified information. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-01382 at 4 (App. Bd. May 16, \n2018).  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s non-tax debts and judgment are mitigated as paid, being paid, or \ncancelled. However, he still owes the IRS about $400,000 and his state more than \n$30,000. He stated that he intends to pay his taxes. Intentions to pay debts in the future \nare not a substitute for a track record of debt repayment or other responsible \napproaches. See ISCR Case No. 11-14570 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 23, 2013). He is credited \nwith the payment agreement he entered into with his state. AG \u00b6 20(g) is applicable to \nhis state taxes, but it does not completely mitigate the judgment issues raised by \nApplicant\u2019s many years of shirking his responsibility to pay his taxes.  \n \nThere is insufficient evidence for a determination that Applicant\u2019s tax problems \nwill be resolved within a reasonable period. I am unable to find that he acted responsibly \nunder the circumstances or made a good-faith effort to pay his taxes. His tax issues are \nrecent and ongoing. They continue to cast doubt on his current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and good judgment. I find that the security concerns arising out of \nApplicant\u2019s unpaid federal and state taxes are not mitigated. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \n\n \n7 \n \nunder Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. I also considered Applicant\u2019s favorable \ncharacter evidence and his long work record. However, he owes more than $400,000 in \nfederal and state income taxes. \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant did not \nmitigate the financial considerations security concerns.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.b: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.c-1.f: \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \na security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n________________________ \nEdward W. Loughran \nAdministrative Judge \n",

After reviewing the information gathered during the background \ninvestigation, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued a statement of reasons (SOR) \non April 27, 2018, alleging security concerns under Guideline F (financial \nconsiderations). Applicant answered the SOR (undated), submitted documentary \nevidence, and requested a hearing before an administrative judge from DOHA. \nDOHA initially assigned the case to other administrative judge and issued a \nnotice of hearing on October 18, 2018, setting the hearing for November 6, 2018. \nDOHA reassigned the case to me on October 30, 2018. At the hearing, the Government \noffered six exhibits (GE 1 through 6). Applicant testified on her own behalf and \nsubmitted four exhibits (AE 1 through 4). AE 4 was received post-hearing. All exhibits \n02/08/2019\n\n \n2 \n \n \nwere admitted as evidence without objections. DOHA received the hearing transcript \n(Tr.) on November 15, 2018. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant admitted SOR allegations 1.a, 1.d, and 1.e. She denied SOR \nallegations 1.b, 1.c, and 1.f through 1.i. Her admissions to the SOR allegations, and \nthose at her hearing, are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a thorough review \nof the record evidence, I make the following additional findings of fact:  \n \nApplicant is a 35-year-old employee of a federal contractor. She completed a \nbachelor\u2019s degree in communications in 2005 and a master\u2019s degree in adult learning \nand instructional technology in 2010. Applicant married in 2007 and divorced in 2009. \nShe has a thirteen-year-old daughter of this marriage. She married her current husband \nin 2013 and now has a step-child. \n \nApplicant has been consistently employed since 2005. She worked for a bank \nbetween 2005 and 2009, for the Army between 2008 and 2011 (overlapping jobs), and \nfor the Air Force between 2011 and 2014. A federal contractor hired Applicant in June \n2014 and is currently sponsoring the continuation of her clearance. She is a senior \nconsultant and supervises two employees. She travels frequently to different military \ninstallations to teach a new accounting system. (Tr. 24) She was first granted a secret \nclearance in 2008, which has been continued to present. \n \nApplicant disclosed in her 2015 SCA that she had financial problems, including \nabout $28,000 in delinquent student loans (received during 2006 and 2007), and \ndelinquent accounts placed for collection or charged off, allegedly resulting from her \n2009 divorce. She also disclosed that she travelled to Panama to visit family and friends \nfor about a week each time in 2007 and 2012. She was questioned about her delinquent \ndebts during her April and July 2016 interviews, some of which are alleged in the SOR. \nThe status of the debts alleged in the SOR is as follows: \n \n1. SOR \u00b6 1.a alleged a charged-off car loan owing $18,535. Applicant admitted \nthis debt. She presented documentary evidence of one $500 payment made in July \n2016 and one $500 payment made in October 2018. She claimed the debt was reduced \nto $12,905 when she turned in the car to the creditor (sometime in 2016-2017), and that \nshe had made a payment arrangement to satisfy the debt. Applicant testified that \u201cevery \ntwo months I have been attempting to make $500 payments to decrease the balance.\u201d \n(Tr. 27) She presented no documentary evidence to show the debt has been reduced to \n$13,000, that she settled it or established a payment arrangement, or that she made \nany additional payments to satisfy the debt. This debt is unresolved. \n \n2. SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b ($10,328) and 1.c ($7,947) alleged delinquent student loans. \nApplicant denied she owed any money to the two alleged collection agencies, but she \nadmitted that she owed four student loans that were currently in forbearance. The \ndocumentary evidence shows Applicant obtained the loans in 2006 and 2007, and they \n\n \n3 \n \n \nbecame delinquent for lack of payment. In about 2014, she entered into a rehabilitation \nprogram, the student loans were purchased by other creditor, and the new creditor \nplaced the four student loans in forbearance. (AE 4) Applicant claimed she is trying to \nmake consistent payments on all her student loans, but she failed to submit \ndocumentary evidence to corroborate her claim of payments made. The student loans \nalleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.c are resolved, but Applicant still owes over $31,000 in \nstudent loans that are currently in forbearance. \n \n3. SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d and 1.e alleged delinquent credit-card accounts owing $2,469 and \n$2,174, respectively, to the same creditor. Applicant admitted these were her accounts \nand stated that the debts were delinquent because her \u201cex-spouse [was] not fulfilling \ndivorce obligations to make the payments on the accounts.\u201d (SOR answer) I note that \nthe divorce decree in evidence (AE 1) has no provisions concerning the allocation of \nmarital assets or debts. \n \nApplicant\u2019s documentary evidence shows that she entered into a $740 settlement \nagreement with the creditor for the account alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.d, and $652 to pay off \nthe debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.e. Both settlement agreements require Applicant to pay off \nthe money not later than June 2019. Applicant claimed she made partial payments on \nboth accounts and that she only owes $350 and $300 (respectively) to pay off the \naccounts. She presented no documentary evidence of any payments made in \naccordance with the settlement agreement.  \n \n4. SOR \u00b6 1.f alleged a $1,711 delinquent debt owed to a telecommunications \nprovider, in collection by another company. SOR \u00b6 1.g alleged a $467 delinquent debt \nowed to the same telecommunications provider. Applicant discussed both debts with a \ngovernment background investigator during her April 2016 interview. She believed both \ndebts were the same, but they were alleged twice. She told the investigator that this \nwas a joint account opened by her and her ex-husband. She claimed that he was \nsupposed to pay the accrued debt after the divorce and failed to do so. She promised to \ncontact the creditor and make payment arrangements. (GE 2) She presented no \ndocumentary evidence to show she contacted the creditor, or that she made any \npayments to resolve the debt. \n \nSubsequently, Applicant disputed both debts through the credit bureau. (GE 5) \nShe stated in her SOR answer: \u201cI deny [these] claims because [they were] deemed \nfraudulent after investigation by the credit bureaus. Apparently, the debts were removed \nfrom her credit report as a result of her dispute.  \n \n5. SOR \u00b6 1.h alleged a $321 delinquent debt owed to a telecommunications \nprovider, in collection by another company. During her April 2016 interview, Applicant \ndisputed the debt, stating that she did not recognize the creditor, and indicated she \nwould dispute it through the credit bureau. In her answer to the SOR, Applicant stated \nthat she had paid the original creditor, and she was disputing the collections agency\u2019s \nclaim. She presented no documentary evidence of any payments made or disputes \nfiled. \n\n \n4 \n \n \n6. SOR \u00b6 1.i alleged a $293 delinquent debt in collection. The documentary \nevidence shows Applicant paid $190 towards the debt, and it is no longer reflected on \nrecent credit reports. \n \nApplicant believes she has done her best to mitigate her delinquent debts. She \naverred that she stays on track with her finances and keeps everything in order. She \nbelieves she has \u201cturned a leaf\u201d with respect to her finances. She attempted to reach all \nof her creditors and to establish payment agreements. She tries to make all of her debt \npayments on time, and does not overextend herself financially. Her intention has always \nbeen to satisfy her debts. She believes she is making a decent amount of money (about \n$5,000 monthly after taxes) and her income-to-debt ratio is sufficient for her to pay her \nliving expenses and her debts. \n \nApplicant attributed her financial problems to her 2012 divorce, and she said that \nshe was a victim of identity theft. She failed to present documentary evidence to show \nshe was a victim of identity theft. She believes she has taken the necessary steps to \ncorrect her financial problems. She enrolled in credit-monitoring and credit-counseling \nprograms, and placed a lock on her credit. She promised to continue making payments \non time and stay on top of her financial situation. She believes that she has matured \nand is now financially stable.  \n \nApplicant considers her current financial situation to be good. She lives within her \nfinancial means, and is trying to repair her credit. She believes she has changed and is \nnow a financially responsible person. She promised to repair her credit and to be \nfinancially responsible.  \n \nPolicies \n \nThe SOR was issued under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation Within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, \nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive) (January \n2, 1992), as amended; and the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines (AG), \nimplemented by Security Executive Agent Directive (SEAD) 4, which are effective June \n8, 2017, which are applicable to all adjudicative decisions issued on or after June 8, \n2017.  \n \nEligibility for access to classified information may be granted \u201conly upon a finding \nthat it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security, emphasizing \nthat \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518, 528 (1988). \n \nThe AG list disqualifying and mitigating conditions for evaluating a person\u2019s \nsuitability for access to classified information. Any one disqualifying or mitigating \n\n \n5 \n \n \ncondition is not, by itself, conclusive. However, the AG should be followed where a case \ncan be measured against them, as they represent policy guidance governing access to \nclassified information. Each decision must reflect a fair, impartial, and commonsense \nconsideration of the whole person and the factors listed in SEAD 4, App. A \u00b6\u00b6 2(d) and \n2(f). All available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, must be considered.  \n \nSecurity clearance decisions resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s security clearance. The Government \nmust prove, by substantial evidence, controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If it does, \nthe burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts. The \napplicant bears the heavy burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue his or her security clearance.  \n \nPersons with access to classified information enter into a fiduciary relationship \nwith the Government based on trust and confidence. Thus, the Government has a \ncompelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgment, \nreliability, and trustworthiness of those who must protect national interest as their own. \nThe \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any \nreasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the Government. \n\u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d \nEgan, 484 U.S. at 531; SEAD 4, \u00b6 E(4); SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6\u00b6 1(d) and 2(b). Clearance \ndecisions are not a determination of the loyalty of the applicant concerned. They are \nmerely an indication that the applicant has or has not met the strict guidelines the \nGovernment has established for issuing a clearance. \n \nAnalysis \n \nFinancial Considerations \n \nAG \u00b6 18 articulates the security concern relating to financial problems:  \n \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . . .  \n \nApplicant\u2019s history of financial problems is documented in the record. Between \n2006 and 2007, she obtained four student loans that became delinquent. Additionally, \nshe had seven delinquent consumer accounts that were in collection or charged off. AG \n\n \n6 \n \n \n\u00b6 19 provides three disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern and may \nbe disqualifying in this case: \u201c(a) inability to satisfy debts\u201d; \u201d(b) unwillingness to satisfy \ndebts regardless of the ability to do so\u201d; and \u201c(c) a history of not meeting financial \nobligations.\u201d The record established the above disqualifying conditions, requiring \nadditional inquiry about the possible applicability of mitigating conditions.  \n \nFive mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially applicable: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n  \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control; \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts;1 and  \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \nThe Appeal Board concisely explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for proving the \napplicability of mitigating conditions as follows:  \n \n                                            \n1 The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a \u201cgood faith\u201d effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts:  \n \nIn order to qualify for application of [the \u201cgood faith\u201d mitigating condition], an applicant \nmust present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \nsome other good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant\u2019s debts. The Directive does \nnot define the term \u201cgood-faith.\u201d However, the Board has indicated that the concept of \ngood-faith \u201crequires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, \nprudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.\u201d Accordingly, an applicant must \ndo more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally available option (such as \nbankruptcy) in order to claim the benefit of [the \u201cgood faith\u201d mitigating condition]. \n \n(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2004) (quoting \nISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. Jun. 4, 2001)).   \n\n \n7 \n \n \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance \nof a security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government \npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the \napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The \nstandard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in \nEgan, supra. \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for \naccess to classified information will be resolved in favor of the national \nsecurity.\u201d Directive, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 2(b).  \n \nISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sep. 24, 2013).  \n \n \nSome of the financial considerations mitigating conditions are partially raised by \nthe facts in this case; however, they do not mitigate the security concerns. AG \u00b6 20(a) is \nnot fully applicable because Applicant\u2019s financial problems are recent and ongoing. AG \n\u00b6 20(b) is partially applicable, but does not mitigate the financial concerns. Applicant\u2019s \ndivorce is a circumstance beyond her control that likely contributed to her financial \nproblems. I also considered that she was a single mother raising a child with limited \nsupport. Notwithstanding, her evidence is insufficient to establish that she was \nfinancially responsible under the circumstances. \n \n \nApplicant should have been more diligent addressing her delinquent debts \nsooner, contacting her creditors, and paying her debts. She has been continually \nemployed since 2005. She started working for the federal government in 2008, and was \ngranted a secret clearance. She submitted an SCA to renew her clearance in 2015, and \nshortly thereafter, she was interviewed twice concerning her financial problems. Her \nexperience holding a clearance, submitting SCA, and the interviews placed Applicant on \nnotice that her financial problems created a security concern. Applicant promised to \ntake care of her financial problems and claimed she had contacted her creditors and \nestablished payment agreements. Applicant\u2019s documentary evidence fell short of \ncorroborating her claims of financial responsibility.  \n \n \nApplicant claimed that she participated in financial counseling and is following a \nbudget. However, her repayment efforts show that her financial problem is not being \nresolved and her finances are not under control. AG \u00b6 20(c) is not applicable. AG \u00b6 \n20(e) is not applicable because she failed to show she had a reasonable basis to \ndispute her delinquent accounts. On the contrary, the evidence shows that during her \n2015-2016 interviews, Applicant stated many of the delinquent debts were her and her \nhusband\u2019s accounts, and promised to contact her creditors and pay them. Sometime \nlater, she disputed the accounts, and they were removed from her credit report without \nher making payments on her accounts. Considering the evidence as a whole, \nApplicant\u2019s evidence is insufficient to mitigate the financial considerations concerns. \n \n\n \n8 \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case, and under the whole-person \nconcept. SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6\u00b6 2(a) and 2(d). I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of these factors were addressed under \nthat guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \n \nApplicant, 35, has been employed with the Government and federal contractors, \nand has held a clearance since 2008. Her evidence is insufficient to demonstrate \nfinancial responsibility and she failed to mitigate the financial considerations concerns.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          \n \n  \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:   \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n  \nSubparagraphs 1.a, 1.d-1.h: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n  \nSubparagraphs 1.b, 1.c, and 1.i:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security interests of the United States to grant \neligibility for a security clearance to Applicant. Clearance is denied. \n \n \n \n____________________________ \nJUAN J. RIVERA \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Gregorian, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n04/23/2019\n__________ \nDecision \n__________ \nHARVEY, Mark, Administrative Judge: \nApplicant\u2019s mother, two sisters, spouse, and three children are citizens and \nresidents of Afghanistan, and he has frequent contact with them. His finances were \nharmed by unemployment, gambling, and paying necessary expenses to support his \nfamily in Afghanistan. He has several substantial unresolved debts. Foreign influence \nand financial considerations security concerns are not mitigated. Eligibility for access to \nclassified information is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn May 4, 2016, Applicant completed and signed a Questionnaire for National \nSecurity Positions (SF 86) or security clearance application (SCA). (Government Exhibit \n(GE) 1) On September 4, 2018, the Department of Defense (DOD) Consolidated \nAdjudications Facility (CAF) issued a statement of reasons (SOR) to Applicant under \nExecutive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry, \nFebruary 20, 1960; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (Directive), January 2, 1992; and Security Executive Agent \nDirective 4, established in Appendix A the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines for \nDetermining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to Hold a \nSensitive Position (AGs), effective June 8, 2017. (Hearing Exhibit (HE) 2)  \n\n \n2                                                                                                                                             \nThe SOR detailed reasons why the DOD CAF did not find under the Directive that \nit is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance \nfor Applicant and recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether \na clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. Specifically, the SOR set \nforth security concerns arising under Guidelines B (foreign influence), F (financial \nconsiderations), and E (personal conduct). \n \nOn October 11, 2018, Applicant responded to the SOR and requested a hearing. \n(HE 3) On December 26, 2018, Department Counsel was ready to proceed. On January \n25, 2019, the case was assigned to me. On February 28, 2019, the Defense Office of \nHearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing, setting the hearing for March \n14, 2019. (HE 1) Applicant\u2019s hearing was held as scheduled.  \n  \nDuring the hearing, Department Counsel offered six exhibits, Applicant did not \nobject to or offer any exhibits; and all proffered exhibits were admitted into evidence. \n(Transcript (Tr.) 21-24; GE 1-6) On March 26, 2019, DOHA received a transcript of the \nhearing. The record was held open until March 28, 2019. (Tr. 93) Applicant provided 25 \npages of documents after his hearing, which were admitted without objection. (Applicant \nExhibit (AE) A pg. 1-25)  \n \nProcedural Rulings \n \nDepartment Counsel offered summaries for administrative notice concerning \nforeign influence security concerns raised by Applicant\u2019s connections to Afghanistan. (Tr. \n24, 90-91; HE 5) There were no objections to me taking administrative notice of facts \nconcerning Afghanistan, and I granted Department Counsel\u2019s request for administrative \nnotice. (Tr. 25; HE 4)  \n \nAdministrative or official notice is the appropriate type of notice used for \nadministrative proceedings. See ISCR Case No. 16-02522 at 2-3 (App. Bd. July 12, \n2017); ISCR Case No. 05-11292 at 4 n. 1 (App. Bd. Apr. 12, 2007); ISCR Case No. 02-\n24875 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2006) (citing ISCR Case No. 02-18668 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. \n10, 2004) and McLeod v. Immigration and Naturalization Service, 802 F.2d 89, 93 n. 4 \n(3d Cir. 1986)). Usually administrative notice at ISCR proceedings is accorded to facts \nthat are either well known or from government reports. See Stein, ADMINISTRATIVE LAW, \nSection 25.01 (Bender & Co. 2006) (listing fifteen types of facts for administrative notice). \nPortions of the administrative notice requests are quoted without quotation marks and \nfootnotes. I have also taken administrative notice of basic facts about the history, \ngeography, population, and diplomatic relationship between the United States and \nAfghanistan from the U.S. State Department Background Note for Afghanistan (Nov. 28, \n2011), https://2009-2017.state.gov/outofdate/bgn/afghanistan/191350.htm.

(Tr. 16-17) Department Counsel moved to withdraw the allegations made under \nGuideline E (personal conduct) in SOR \u00b6 3. (Tr.12-16) Applicant did not object; I granted \nthe motion; and I crossed through, initialed, and dated the allegations in SOR \u00b6 3.

(HE 3) \nHis admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. He also provided extenuating \nand mitigating information.

(Tr. 90) \n \nFinancial Considerations \n \nThe SOR alleges in \u00b6 2.a that Applicant had a gambling addiction beginning in \nabout 2012. The SOR alleges in \u00b6\u00b6 2.b through 2.g that Applicant borrowed funds in \nvarious amounts from friends under false pretenses to support his gambling habit, and \nhe did not repay the debts as follows: in 2014, $200 (\u00b6 2.b); in November 2014, $3,000 \nto $7,000 (\u00b6 2.c); in December 2014, $1,700 (\u00b6 2.d); in May 2015, $300 (\u00b6 2.e); in \nOctober 2015, $1,100 (\u00b6 2.f); and in November 2015, $300 (\u00b6 2.g). In 2012, he had \nsaved about $50,000. (Tr. 61) By mid-2014, he had lost all of his savings through \ngambling. (Tr. 62) When he was in Afghanistan in 2014, he lost about $15,000 gambling. \n(Tr. 62, 86-87) Between March 2014, and June 2016, he lost about $60,000 gambling. \n(Tr. 63) In total, he lost about $125,000 gambling. He borrowed about $10,000 from six \nfriends who live in the United States as listed in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.b to 2.g to use for gambling. \n(Tr. 64-65)  \n \nApplicant paid the friend in SOR \u00b6 2.c $5,200; however, his friend said Applicant \nstill owes $1,512. (Tr. 67) He said he paid the debt in SOR \u00b6 2.b, and he did not have \ncontact information for the creditors in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.e and 2.g. (SOR response) He either \n\n \n5                                                                                                                                             \npaid or offered to repay the friend in SOR \u00b6 2.d. (Tr. 65) He has been attempting to \ncontact some friends to whom he owes $200 or $300, and he is willing to repay them. \n(Tr. 68)      \n \nSOR \u00b6 2.h alleges in about 2014 to 2015, Applicant initiated electronic fund \ntransfers to a credit card, even though he knew he did not have the funds to cover the \ntransfers in his account. He then used his credit card for cash advances to enable him to \ngamble. (Tr. 69-71; SOR response)  \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.i, 2.j, and 2.k allege three delinquent debts as follows: a charged-off \ndebt owed to a bank for $19,382 (\u00b6 2.i); a debt placed for collection for $2,515 (\u00b6 2.j); \nand a debt placed for collection for $617 (2.k).  \n \nFor the debt in SOR \u00b6 2.i, he borrowed $12,500 and used the funds to gamble. \n(Tr. 69-72) In 2016, he made three payments totaling about $750. He wanted to offer to \nincrease his payments. However, he was unable to make the payment arrangements \nwith the creditor, and he stopped making payments. (Tr. 70, 77-78) \n \nFor the debt in SOR \u00b6 2.j, he borrowed $1,500. He used the funds he borrowed to \nmake a payment to address a debt owed to a friend, and he provided some money to his \nfamily in Afghanistan. (Tr. 79) He recently offered to pay the creditor $1,500; however, \nthe creditor wanted $2,500. (Tr. 79) He is willing to settle the debt; however, he was \nunable to arrange a settlement that was fair. (Tr. 79-80) \n \nFor the debt in SOR \u00b6 2.k, he borrowed $300, and he used the funds to pay for \ngroceries and gasoline in 2015 or 2016. (Tr. 80) He was willing to pay the creditor $300; \nhowever, the creditor wanted $600. (Tr. 80) He is willing to settle the debt; however, he \nwas unable to arrange a settlement. (Tr. 80-81) Several months before his hearing, he \nconsulted a debt settlement company; however, he did not agree to start the program. \n(Tr. 84-85)   \n \nIn June 2016, Applicant told an Officer of Personnel Management (OPM) \ninvestigator that he stopped gambling. (Tr. 73) In December 2017, he told an OPM \ninvestigator that he gambled after June 2016. (Tr. 73) After June 2016, he said he \ngambled about six times. (Tr. 73) Since 2016, he has lost more than $10,000 gambling. \n(Tr. 74) He said he is trying to control his gambling. (Tr. 74) He has reduced his \ngambling from two or three times a week to about once a month or less. (Tr. 75, 83) He \ncontinues to have brief urges to gamble; however, he is able to resist these urges and \nnot gamble. (Tr. 75) He has watched some documentaries and Internet presentations on \ngambling addiction; however, he has never received gambling-addiction counseling or \ntherapy. (Tr. 83) \n \nApplicant has little savings and lives month-to-month on his salary. (Tr. 82) In \n2015, he received a federal income tax refund, and he used half for gambling and sent \nthe remainder to his family in Afghanistan. His employer owes Applicant about $8,000, \nand Applicant expects to be paid soon. (Tr. 82) \n \n\n \n6                                                                                                                                             \nCharacter Evidence \n \nApplicant served with the U.S. Army and Marines on combat patrols in \nAfghanistan. (Tr. 87; AE A) He received multiple certificates of appreciation and training \nand letters of support for his service as a linguist in Afghanistan and the United States. \n(AE A) Letters and certificates lauded his outstanding performance of duty and support \nof U.S. Forces in a combat environment. (AE A) He contributed to mission \naccomplishment. (AE A) In 2006, a U.S. Army brigadier general recommended Applicant \nfor special immigrant status because of his contributions to U.S. Armed Forces in \nAfghanistan in 2005. (AE A at 16) \n \nAfghanistan \n \nAfghanistan is a country in Southwestern Asia that is approximately the size of \nTexas (249,935 square miles). Pakistan borders it on the east and the south. Iran \nborders it on the west and Russia to the north. It is a rugged and mountainous country \nwhich has been fought over by powerful nations for centuries. In 2009, the population \nwas about 28 million people with about 3 million Afghans living outside Afghanistan, \nmainly in Pakistan and Iran, although over 5 million have returned since the removal of \nthe Taliban regime. \n \nAfghanistan is presently an Islamic Republic with a democratically-elected \npresident. Afghanistan has had a turbulent political history, including an invasion by the \nSoviet Union in 1979. After an accord was reached in 1989, and the Soviet Union \nwithdrew from Afghanistan, fighting continued among the various ethnic, clan, and \nreligious militias. By the end of 1998, the Taliban rose to power and controlled 90% of \nthe country, imposing aggressive and repressive policies.   \n \nIn October 2001, U.S. forces and coalition partners led military operations in the \ncountry, forcing the Taliban out of power by November 2001. The coalition sought to \noust al-Qaeda, Osama bin Laden, and other terrorists seeking to attack the United \nStates from Afghanistan. The new democratic government took power in 2004 after a \npopular election.  \n \nA U.S. State Department Travel Advisory remains in effect for Afghanistan at \nTravel Advisory Level 4-Do not travel. The State Department warns U.S. citizens \nagainst travel to Afghanistan because of continued instability and threats by terrorist \norganizations against U.S. citizens. Travel to all areas of Afghanistan remains unsafe \ndue to the ongoing risk of kidnapping, hostage-taking, suicide bombings, military \ncombat operations, landmines, terrorist and insurgent attacks, banditry, armed rivalry \nbetween political and tribal groups, militant attacks, direct and indirect fire, and \ninsurgent attacks, including attacks using vehicle-borne or other IEDs. Attacks may also \ntarget official Afghan and U.S. governmental convoys and compounds, foreign \nembassies, military installations, and other public areas. \n \nNo province in Afghanistan is immune from violence, and the potential exists \nthroughout the country for hostile acts, either targeted or random, against United States \nand other foreign nationals at any time. Extremists associated with various terrorist \n\n \n7                                                                                                                                             \nnetworks and members of other armed opposition groups are active throughout the \ncountry and remain violently opposed to the Afghan government and Coalition Forces. \nThese terrorist groups have attacked Afghan, Coalition Forces, and U.S. targets with \nlittle regard for or the express intent to cause civilian casualties.  \n \nAccording to the June 2017 U.S. Department of Defense report on Afghanistan, \nAfghanistan faces a continuing threat from insurgent and terrorist networks present or \noperating in the Afghanistan-Pakistan region. Department Counsel\u2019s administrative \nnotice lists recent terrorist attacks in Afghanistan resulting in the deaths of hundreds of \ncivilians and military personnel in 2017 and 2018. Although al-Qaeda\u2019s core leadership \nin the Afghanistan-Pakistan border region has been degraded, elements continue to \nseek safe haven on both sides of the border to regenerate and conduct attack planning.  \n \nThe United States\u2019 extraordinary commitment to Afghanistan is balanced against \nthe inherent dangers of the ongoing conflict in Afghanistan to its citizens and residents \nand Afghan government problems developing and complying with the rule of law. A top \nnational security goal of the United States is to establish relationships, cooperation, \ntraining, and support of the Afghanistan Government and military in the ongoing war \nagainst terrorism. \n \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the \nExecutive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security \nemphasizing, \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. \nEgan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the \nauthority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine \nwhether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. \nat 527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended.    \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable.  \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be \n\n \n8                                                                                                                                             \na determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \nSee also Exec. Or. 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), \u00a7 3.1. Thus, nothing in this Decision should \nbe construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole or in part, on any \nexpress or implied determination about applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or patriotism. It is \nmerely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President,  \nSecretary of Defense, and DNI have established for issuing a clearance. \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in \nthe personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant \nfrom being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden \nof establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).  \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of \ndisproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. \n02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, \nif they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).   \n \nAnalysis \n \n Foreign Influence \n \n  \nAG \u00b6 6 explains the security concern about \u201cforeign contacts and interests\u201d \nstating: \n \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they \nresult in divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern \nif they create circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to \npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign \ncontacts and interests should consider the country in which the foreign \ncontact or interest is located, including, but not limited to, considerations \nsuch as whether it is known to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or \nsensitive information or is associated with a risk of terrorism. \n \n\n \n9                                                                                                                                             \nAG \u00b6 7 has conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion;  \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the \nindividual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing \nthat information or technology; and \n(f) substantial business, financial, or property interests in a foreign \ncountry, or in any foreign owned or foreign-operated business that could \nsubject the individual to a heightened risk of foreign influence or \nexploitation or personal conflict of interest. \nApplicant\u2019s mother, two sisters, spouse, and three children are citizens and \nresidents of Afghanistan, and he has frequent contact with them. He provides financial \nsupport to his mother, one sister, spouse, and three children. He owns the home where \nhis mother, spouse, and children live in Afghanistan. His financial support and frequent \ncontacts with family living in Afghanistan are manifestations of his care and concern for \nthem. He has numerous additional relatives, including in-laws, in Afghanistan that he is \nnot close to. \n \nWhen an allegation under a disqualifying condition is established, \u201cthe Directive \npresumes there is a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct or \ncircumstances . . . and an applicant\u2019s security [or trustworthiness] eligibility. Direct or \nobjective evidence of nexus is not required.\u201d ISCR Case No. 17-00507 at 2 (App. Bd. \nJune 13, 2018) (citing ISCR Case No. 15-08385 at 4 (App. Bd. May 23, 2018)). \u201cThe \npresence of close relatives in a country in which terrorists operate and/or which has a \npoor human rights record is significant in Guideline B cases.\u201d ISCR Case No. 11-06925 \n(App. Bd. Dec. 13, 2013) at 4 (discussing denial of access to classified information \nbecause of relatives in Pakistan). \u201cFactors such as the obscurity of foreign relatives or \nthe failure of foreign persons to contact those relatives do not provide a meaningful \nmeasure of whether an applicant\u2019s circumstances pose a security risk.\u201d Id. \n \nThere are widely documented safety issues for residents of Afghanistan primarily \nbecause of terrorists and criminals. Applicant has voluntarily shared in dangers from \nterrorists and insurgents on behalf of the DOD when he was deployed to Afghanistan as \na linguist for a DOD contractor, and he is willing to do so in the future. Numerous \nlinguists, supporting U.S. forces, have family living in countries that have problems with \nterrorists and criminals. Thousands of United States and coalition armed forces and \ncivilian contractors have served in the Middle East, Afghanistan, Iraq, and Pakistan, and \nthey have been and are targets of terrorists, along with their families, located in those \ncountries.   \n\n \n10                                                                                                                                           \nThe mere possession of close family ties with relatives living in Afghanistan is \nnot, as a matter of law, disqualifying under Guideline B. However, if an applicant or his \nor her spouse has such a relationship with even one person living in a foreign country, \nthis factor alone is sufficient to create the potential for foreign influence and could \npotentially result in the compromise of classified information. See ISCR Case No. 08-\n02864 at 4-5 (App. Bd. Dec. 29, 2009) (discussing problematic visits of applicant\u2019s \nfather to Iran).  \n  \nThere is a rebuttable presumption that a person has ties of affection for, or \nobligation to, his or her immediate family members, and this presumption includes in-\nlaws. ISCR Case No. 07-06030 at 3 (App. Bd. June 19, 2008); ISCR Case No. 05-\n00939 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 3, 2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 01-03120 at 4 (App. Bd. Feb. \n20, 2002).    \n \nThe DOHA Appeal Board has indicated for Guideline B cases, \u201cthe nature of the \nforeign government involved and the intelligence-gathering history of that government \nare among the important considerations that provide context for the other record \nevidence and must be brought to bear on the Judge\u2019s ultimate conclusions in the case. \nThe country\u2019s human rights record is another important consideration.\u201d ISCR Case No. \n16-02435 at 3 (App. Bd. May 15, 2018) (citing ISCR Case No. 15-00528 at 3 (App. Bd. \nMar. 13, 2017)). These factors are relevant in assessing the likelihood that an \napplicant\u2019s family members living in that country are vulnerable to government coercion \nor inducement.  \n \nThe risk of coercion, persuasion, or duress is significantly greater if the foreign \ncountry has an authoritarian government, the government ignores the rule of law \nincluding widely accepted civil liberties, a family member is associated with or \ndependent upon the government, the government is engaged in a counterinsurgency, \nterrorists cause a substantial amount of death or property damage, or the country is \nknown to conduct intelligence collection operations against the United States. The \nrelationship of Afghanistan with the United States, and the situations in those countries \nplaces a significant burden of persuasion on Applicant to demonstrate that his \nrelationships with any family member living in or visiting those countries does not pose a \ntrustworthiness or security risk. Applicant should not be placed into a position where he \nmight be forced to choose between loyalty to the United States and a desire to assist a \nrelative living in or visiting Afghanistan.2  \n                                            \n2 The Appeal Board in ISCR Case No. 03-24933, 2005 DOHA LEXIS 346 at *20-*21 n. 18 (App. \nBd. 2005), explained how relatives in a foreign country have a security significance: \n \nThe issue under Guideline B is not whether an applicant\u2019s immediate family members in \na foreign country are of interest to a foreign power based on their prominence or personal \nsituation. Rather, the issue is whether an applicant\u2019s ties and contacts with immediate \nfamily members in a foreign country raise security [or trustworthiness] concerns because \nthose ties and contacts create a potential vulnerability that a foreign power could seek to \nexploit in an effort to get unauthorized access to U.S. classified information that an \napplicant -- not the applicant\u2019s immediate family members -- has by virtue of a security \nclearance [or public trust position]. A person may be vulnerable to influence or pressure \nexerted on, or through, the person\u2019s immediate family members -- regardless of whether \nthe person\u2019s family members are prominent or not. \n\n \n11                                                                                                                                           \nGuideline B security or trustworthiness concerns are not limited to countries \nhostile to the United States. \u201cThe United States has a compelling interest in protecting \nand safeguarding classified information from any person, organization, or country that is \nnot authorized to have access to it, regardless of whether that person, organization, or \ncountry has interests inimical to those of the United States.\u201d ISCR Case No. 02-11570 \nat 5 (App. Bd. May 19, 2004). Furthermore, friendly nations can have profound \ndisagreements with the United States over matters they view as important to their vital \ninterests or national security. Finally, we know friendly nations have engaged in \nespionage against the United States, especially in the economic, scientific, and \ntechnical fields. See ISCR Case No. 02-22461, 2005 DOHA LEXIS 1570 at *11-*12 \n(App. Bd. Oct. 27, 2005) (citing ISCR Case No. 02-26976 at 5-6 (App. Bd. Oct. 22, \n2004)) (discussing Taiwan). \nWhile there is no evidence that intelligence operatives, criminals, or terrorists \nfrom or in Afghanistan seek or have sought classified or economic information from or \nthrough Applicant or his family, nevertheless, it is not prudent to rule out such a \npossibility in the future. International terrorist groups are known to conduct intelligence \nactivities as effectively as capable state intelligence services, and Afghanistan has a \nsignificant problem with terrorism and crime. Applicant\u2019s family in Afghanistan \u201ccould be \na means through which Applicant comes to the attention of those who seek U.S. \ninformation or technology and who would attempt to exert coercion upon him.\u201d ADP \nCase No. 14-01655 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 9, 2015) (citing ISCR Case No. 14-02950 at 3 \n(App. Bd. May 14, 2015)).  \nApplicant\u2019s relationship with his family who are citizens and residents of \nAfghanistan create a potential conflict of interest because terrorists could place \npressure on them in an effort to cause Applicant to compromise classified information. \nThis relationship creates \u201ca heightened risk of foreign inducement, manipulation, \npressure, or coercion\u201d under AG \u00b6 7. Their citizenship and residence in Afghanistan, \nand Applicant\u2019s relationships with them, have raised the issue of potential foreign \npressure or attempted exploitation. AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a), 7(b), and 7(f) apply, and further inquiry \nis necessary about potential application of any mitigating conditions.  \n \nAG \u00b6 8 lists conditions that could mitigate foreign influence security concerns \nincluding: \n \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which \nthese persons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in \nthat country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a \nposition of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, \ngroup, organization, or government and the interests of the United States; \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest; \n\n \n12                                                                                                                                           \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation; \n \n(d) the foreign contacts and activities are on U.S. Government business or \nare approved by the agency head or designee; \n \n(e) the individual has promptly complied with existing agency requirements \nregarding the reporting of contacts, requests, or threats from persons, \ngroups, or organizations from a foreign country; and \n \n(f) the value or routine nature of the foreign business, financial, or property \ninterests is such that they are unlikely to result in a conflict and could not \nbe used effectively to influence, manipulate, or pressure the individual. \n \nThe DOHA Appeal Board concisely explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for \nproving the applicability of mitigating conditions as follows:  \n \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of \na security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government \npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the \napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The \nstandard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in \nEgan, supra. \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access \nto classified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nDirective, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 2(b).  \n \nISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013).  \n  \nApplicant\u2019s relationships with his in-laws as alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e and 1.f are not \nsufficiently developed in the record to raise an independent security concern.   \n \nAG \u00b6 8(b) partially applies to his relationships with his family living in Afghanistan. \nApplicant has frequent contacts with and provides financial support to his mother, \nspouse, children, and two sisters who are citizens and residents of Afghanistan.3 A key \nfactor in the AG \u00b6 8(b) analysis is Applicant\u2019s \u201cdeep and longstanding relationships and \nloyalties in the U.S.\u201d In 2009, Applicant immigrated to the United States, and in 2015, he \nwas naturalized as a U.S. citizen. He has supported U.S. goals in Afghanistan during \n                                            \n3 See ADP Case No. 05-17812 at 2, 3 n.2 (App. Bd.

He honorably served as a linguist in Afghanistan.  \n      \nApplicant\u2019s support to the DOD in Afghanistan, including the dangers that service \nentailed, weighs heavily towards mitigating security concerns. Applicant seeks a security \nclearance to enable him to continue serving in Afghanistan and providing assistance to \nDOD. He has shown his patriotism, loyalty, and fidelity to the United States during his \nsupport to DOD while serving in Afghanistan.   \n \nIn ISCR Case No. 17-00629 at 4 (App. Bd. May 24, 2018), the Appeal Board \ncogently explained the relevance of such service on behalf of the United States: \n \nSuch evidence demonstrates that Applicant has repeatedly been willing to \nassume a high level of risk on behalf of the U.S. and shows his ties and \nsense of obligation to the U.S. could be sufficiently strong enough to \nsupport a favorable application of mitigating condition 8(b). See ISCR \nCase No. 05-03846 at 6 (App. Bd. Nov 14, 2006) (An applicant\u2019s work in \nsupport of U.S. forces in Afghanistan occurred \u201cin the context of \ndangerous high-risk circumstances in which [he] made a significant \ncontribution to national security.\u201d) See also ISCR Case No. 04-12363 at 2 \n(App. Bd.

Mar. 19, 2012).  \n \nApplicant\u2019s relationship with the United States and service in Afghanistan must \nbe weighed against the potential conflict of interest created by his relationships with \nrelatives who are citizens and residents of Afghanistan. Applicant has close \nrelationships with family in Afghanistan, and they are at risk from criminals, terrorists, \nand human rights violations of the Afghan Government.  \n \nIt is important to be mindful of the United States\u2019 huge historical investment of \nmanpower and money in Afghanistan, and Applicant has supported U.S. goals and \nobjectives in that country. Applicant, through his family living in Afghanistan, is a \npotential target of terrorists, and Applicant\u2019s potential access to classified information \ncould theoretically add risk to his relatives living in Afghanistan.   \n                                            \n4 ISCR Case No. 17-00629 (App. Bd. May 24, 2018) the Appeal Board discussed a translator\u2019s \nmultiple tours on behalf of the United States in Iraq, limited time as a resident in the United States, and \nconnections to family living in Iraq. The Appeal Board stated: \n     \nIn general, an applicant\u2019s deployment to a combat zone in support of U.S. forces is not a \nfactor that weighs against his or her national security eligibility. On the contrary, such \ndeployments tend to establish various mitigating conditions such as [Directive] \u00b6 8(b) \n(\u201cthere is no conflict of interest . . . because . . . the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding loyalties in the United States, that the individual can be expected to resolve \nany conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest\u201d); [Directive] \u00b6 8(d) (\u201cthe foreign . . . \nactivities are on U.S. Government business\u201d); and [Directive] \u00b6 8(f) (\u201cthe value or routine \nnature of the foreign business . . . is such that [it is] unlikely to result in a conflict of \ninterest and could not be used effectively to influence, manipulate, or pressure the \nindividual.\u201d) \n \nId. at 3 (internal footnotes omitted) (remanding administrative judge\u2019s denial of security clearance). \n\n \n14                                                                                                                                           \nIn sum, Applicant\u2019s connections to his relatives living in Afghanistan are too \nsignificant to mitigate in the circumstances Applicant presented. His connections to the \nUnited States taken together are not sufficient to overcome the foreign influence \nsecurity concerns under Guideline B.  \n \nFinancial Considerations \n \nAG \u00b6 18 articulates the security concern for financial problems: \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is \nfinancially overextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or \notherwise questionable acts to generate funds. . . . \n \nThe Appeal Board explained the scope and rationale for the financial \nconsiderations security concern in ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, \n2012) (citation omitted) as follows: \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might \nknowingly compromise classified information in order to raise money in \nsatisfaction of his or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the \ntotality of an applicant\u2019s financial history and circumstances. The Judge \nmust consider pertinent evidence regarding the applicant\u2019s self-control, \njudgment, and other qualities essential to protecting the national secrets \nas well as the vulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive \npresumes a nexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines \nand an applicant\u2019s security eligibility.  \n \n  \nAG \u00b6 19 includes disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern and \nmay be disqualifying in this case:  \n \n  \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n \n  \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; \n \n(d) deceptive or illegal financial practices such as embezzlement, \nemployee theft, check fraud, expense account fraud, mortgage fraud, filing \ndeceptive loan statements and other intentional financial breaches of trust; \n \n(e) consistent spending beyond one's means or frivolous or irresponsible \nspending, which may be indicated by excessive indebtedness, significant \nnegative cash flow, a history of late payments or of non-payment, or other \nnegative financial indicators; and \n \n\n \n15                                                                                                                                           \n(i) concealing gambling losses, family conflict, or other problems caused \nby gambling. \n \n  \nIn ISCR Case No. 08-12184 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan. 7, 2010), the Appeal Board \nexplained: \n \nIt is well-settled that adverse information from a credit report can normally \nmeet the substantial evidence standard and the government\u2019s obligations \nunder [Directive] \u00b6 E3.1.14 for pertinent allegations. At that point, the \nburden shifts to applicant to establish either that [he or] she is not \nresponsible for the debt or that matters in mitigation apply. \n \n(internal citation omitted). Applicant\u2019s history of delinquent debt is documented in his \ncredit reports, SOR response, and hearing. The record establishes the disqualifying \nconditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), 19(c), 19(d), 19(e), and 19(i) requiring additional inquiry \nabout the possible applicability of mitigating conditions. \n \nSix financial considerations mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable in this case:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago,5 was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control;  \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts;6 and  \n                                            \n5 A debt that became delinquent several years ago is still considered recent because \u201can \napplicant\u2019s ongoing, unpaid debts evidence a continuing course of conduct and, therefore, can be viewed \nas recent for purposes of the Guideline F mitigating conditions.\u201d ISCR Case No. 15-06532 at 3 (App. Bd. \nFebruary 16, 2017) (citing ISCR Case No. 15-01690 at 2 (App. Bd. Sep. 13, 2016)). \n \n6 The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a \u201cgood faith\u201d effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts:  \n \nIn order to qualify for application of [the \u201cgood faith\u201d mitigating condition], an applicant \nmust present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \nsome other good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant\u2019s debts. The Directive does \n\n \n16                                                                                                                                           \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \n \nNone of the mitigating conditions fully apply; however, Applicant is credited with \nsome mitigation due to periods of unemployment or underemployment. His mother, \nspouse, and children reside in Afghanistan, and he has provided substantial support to \nthem. He also made some progress paying his debts. He is credited with mitigating the \ndebts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.b (debt for $200), 2.e (debt for $300), and 2.g (debt for $300). He \nsaid he paid the debt in SOR \u00b6 2.b, and he did not have contact information for the \ncreditors in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.e and 2.g. The magnitude of the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.b, 2.e, and \n2.g are of low magnitude ($300 or below), and are owed to friends. He said he would \npay all of these debts if he had contact information. He did not provide enough \ninformation about his efforts to locate and pay the remaining debts to his friends, which \nexceed $1,000 each, and those debts are not mitigated. When he borrowed the funds \nfrom his friends, he did not tell his friends that he was borrowing the money to spend on \ngambling. \n \n \nApplicant lost about $125,000 gambling. He currently has delinquent debts. He \ndid not make any payments for more than one year on several delinquent debts, and he \ndoes not have any established payment agreements to address them in the near future. \nHe obtained electronic fund transfers without having a balance to support the transfer, \nwhich is a deceptive financial practice. See SOR \u00b6 2.h. He continued to gamble albeit at \na lesser frequency. Although he has received some advice on how to control his \ngambling, he has not received formal counseling or therapy to address his gambling. \nThere is insufficient evidence to warrant a conclusion that he will not have financial \nproblems in the future due to gambling.  \n \nThere is insufficient evidence about why Applicant was unable to make greater \nprogress resolving his delinquent debts. There is insufficient assurance that his financial \nproblems are being resolved, are under control, and will not recur in the future. He failed \nto establish that financial considerations security concerns are mitigated. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n                                                                                                                                            \nnot define the term \u201cgood-faith.\u201d However, the Board has indicated that the concept of \ngood-faith \u201crequires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, \nprudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.\u201d Accordingly, an applicant must \ndo more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally available option (such as \nbankruptcy) in order to claim the benefit of [the \u201cgood faith\u201d mitigating condition]. \n \n(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2004) (quoting \nISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 4, 2001)). \n\n \n17                                                                                                                                           \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n  \n     \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), \u201c[t]he ultimate determination\u201d of whether to grant a security \nclearance \u201cmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines\u201d and the whole-person concept. My comments under \nGuidelines B and F are incorporated in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors \nin AG \u00b6 2(d) were addressed under those guidelines but some warrant additional \ncomment. \n \nApplicant is 36 years old, and he worked as a linguist from 2003 to 2011, and \nfrom 2012 to 2013, in Afghanistan. He is seeking to resume his employment as a \nlinguist in Afghanistan. In 2007, he married, and his children are ages 5, 8, and 11. In \n2009, Applicant immigrated to the United States, and in 2015, he was naturalized as a \nU.S. citizen. Applicant, his spouse, and children were born in Afghanistan. Applicant\u2019s \nspouse and children have received U.S. permanent residence visas or green cards. He \nprovides financial support to his family in Afghanistan. Applicant inherited the home \nwhere his family resides in Afghanistan from Applicant\u2019s father.   \n \nApplicant lost about $125,000 from gambling over several years. He \nacknowledges his problem from excessive gambling. He continued to occasionally \ngamble even after becoming aware through an OPM interview that his gambling raised \na security issue. He has delinquent debts that are not in a payment plan. His financial \nresponsibility continues to be a security concern. \n \nConnections to foreign countries must be balanced against connections to the \nUnited States. Applicant resided in the United States from 2009 to present, except for \nseveral years when he was serving in Afghanistan as a linguist and visits to his family in \nAfghanistan. He is renting part of an apartment in the United States, and he has a bank \naccount in the United States. He took the oath of allegiance to the United States when \nhe became a U.S. citizen.  \n \nSoldiers that served with Applicant in Afghanistan and the United States lauded \nhis diligence, professionalism, and contributions to mission accomplishment in letters \nand certificates. During Applicant\u2019s support of U.S. interests as a linguist in Afghanistan, \nhe made contributions at personal risk on behalf of U.S. combat forces in Afghanistan. \nAll these circumstances increase the probability that Applicant will recognize, resist, and \nreport any attempts by a foreign power, terrorist group, or insurgent group to coerce or \nexploit him. See ISCR Case No. 07-00034 at 2 (App. Bd. Feb. 5, 2008). His past \nhonorable service in Afghanistan weighs heavily towards mitigation of foreign influence \nsecurity concerns. See ISCR Case No. 07-00034 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 5, 2008) (affirming \ngrant of security clearance and commenting \u201cApplicant has served as a translator and \n\n \n18                                                                                                                                           \nas a cultural liaison between Americans and Afghan citizens, diffusing tensions and \nfacilitating transactions between the two groups. . . . Applicant put his life in danger on \nat least one occasion to protect American lives and interests in Afghanistan.\u201d). \n \nA Guideline B decision must take into consideration the geopolitical situation and \ndangers of the country involved.7 Afghanistan is a dangerous place due to violence from \nterrorists and criminals, and Afghanistan\u2019s government does not respect the full \nspectrum of human rights. Terrorists continue to threaten Afghanistan citizens and \nresidents, the Afghanistan government, the interests of the United States, and those \nwho cooperate and assist the United States. The United States and Afghanistan are \ndemocracies, allies in the war on terrorism, and trading partners. They have numerous \nimportant common interests.  \n \nApplicant has frequent contact with or cares for his mother, spouse, children, and \ntwo sisters, who are citizens and residents of Afghanistan. His spouse and children lived \nin the United States for four months in 2014, and then they returned to Afghanistan. He \nprovides financial support to his mother, two sisters, spouse, and children. Frequent \ncontacts with and financial support for family in foreign countries are manifestations of \nhis care and concern for relatives living in Afghanistan. However, those same close  \nrelationships with residents and citizens of Afghanistan raise important foreign influence \nsecurity concerns. \n \nI have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518 (1988), Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, and the AGs, to the facts and \ncircumstances in the context of the whole person. I conclude foreign influence and \nfinancial considerations security concerns are not mitigated.

Access to classified information is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (e-QIP) on October 10, 2017. \nOn April 25, 2018, the Department of Defense (DOD) sent him a Statement of Reasons \n(SOR), alleging security concerns under Guideline F. The DOD acted under Executive \nOrder (E.O.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, \n1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) implemented by DOD on June 8, 2017.  \nApplicant answered the SOR on May 8, 2018, and requested a decision on the \nrecord without a hearing. Department Counsel submitted the Government\u2019s written case \non June 1, 2018. On that same day, a complete copy of the file of relevant material \n(FORM,) which included Government Exhibits (GX) 1 through 6, was sent to Applicant, \nwho was given an opportunity to file objections and submit material to refute, extenuate, \n01/29/2019\n\n \n2\nor mitigate the Government\u2019s evidence. He received the FORM on June 14, 2018, and \ndid not file a Response.1 The case was assigned to me on October 11, 2018.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nUnder Guideline F, the SOR alleges that Applicant has 16 delinquent accounts \ntotaling $64,265. Applicant denies SOR \u00b6 1.a, a $12,765 debt for a car loan, and SOR \u00b6 \n1.p, a $1,136 credit-card account. He admits the remaining 14 debts, all of which are \ndelinquent student loans totaling $50,364. The delinquent debts are reflected in \nApplicant\u2019s credit bureau reports (CBR) from May 2018 and December 2017, and \ndiscussed on his e-QIP and during his personal subject interview (PSI). (GX 6; GX 5; GX \n3; GX 4.) Applicant\u2019s admissions are incorporated in my findings of fact.   \n \nApplicant is a 33-year-old service desk administrator currently working for a \ndefense contractor since September 2017. He served honorably in the U.S. Air Force \nfrom June 2006 until March 2012, and was granted a security clearance in November \n2006.  He received his associate\u2019s degree in 2013 and his bachelor\u2019s degree in 2015. He \nand his wife married in 2009. (GX 2.)  \n \nApplicant denies that he owes the $12,765 debt for a car loan alleged in SOR \u00b6 \n1.a. According to Applicant, during the process of purchasing a new car from a dealership, \nthe dealership paid off the loan on the car that Applicant was trading in, but then would \nnot accept the actual trade in. Applicant went to a second dealership, where he was \ninformed that the original dealership had paid off the trade-in car. When the original \ndealership discovered that it had paid for a trade-in that it did not receive, it changed its \nrecords to reflect that Applicant was liable for the amount the original dealership paid for \nthe trade in. (GX 3; GX 2.) With his Answer, Applicant provided a letter from the lender \nfrom November 2014 that stated the loan for the trade in had been paid in full. Applicant \nfurther stated that he discussed the loan with another dealership and was told that he was \nnot responsible for the debt. However, Applicant\u2019s CBRs show that the account was \ncharged off by the original dealership in April 2015. Applicant\u2019s May 2018 CBR also shows \nthat he disputed the debt after it was charged off. Applicant did not provide any information \nabout what actually happened to the trade-in car. This debt remains unresolved.   \n \nApplicant provided a letter from March 2018 from the creditor of the $1,136 credit-\ncard debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.p, which stated that the account was paid. This debt has \nbeen resolved. \n \nApplicant admitted each of the 14 delinquent student loan accounts. He attributes \nhis inability to pay his student loans to underemployment. Applicant asserted that he was \ntrying to consolidate his student loans and that he was seeking better paying employment \n                                            \n1 The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) transmittal letter is dated June 1, 2018, and \nApplicant\u2019s receipt is dated June 14, 2018. The DOHA transmittal letter informed Applicant that he had 30 \ndays after receiving it to submit information.

However, there is no record evidence of resolution \nof these debts. \n \nApplicant was unemployed for five months after leaving the military in 2012. \nHowever, he has been consistently employed since August 2012. \n \nPolicies \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended.  \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant\u2019s meeting the \ncriteria contained in the AG. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, \nrecognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies these \nguidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available and reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. Or. \n10865 \u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the \napplicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense \nhave established for issuing a clearance. \n \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \n\n \n4\nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 92-1106 at 3, \n1993 WL 545051 at *3 (App. Bd. Oct. 7, 1993).  \n \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \n \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18:  \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is financially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. \n \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified \ninformation. See ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \n \n \n \nThe record evidence establishes two disqualifying conditions under this guideline: \nAG \u00b6 19(a) (\u201cinability to satisfy debts\u201d) and AG \u00b6 19(c) (\u201ca history of not meeting financial \nobligations\u201d).  \n  \nApplicant\u2019s financial issues are recent, ongoing, and unresolved. Applicant is \nlegally obligated to pay his student loans and his failure to do so raises concerns about \nhis willingness to abide by rules and regulations, and about his reliability, trustworthiness, \nand good judgment. Applicant did he provide any evidence of any actions he has taken \nto resolve his delinquent accounts. None of the mitigating conditions apply. \n \n \n\n \n5\nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. \nSome of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(a) were addressed under that guideline, but I have also \nconsidered the following: \n \n \nApplicant served honorably in the military from 2006 until 2012. His \nunderemployment has adversely affected his ability to meet his financial obligations. \nHowever, Applicant\u2019s failure to satisfy his legal obligations raises concerns about his \nsecurity worthiness.  \n \n \n \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline F, and \nevaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has \nnot mitigated the security concerns raised by his delinquent debts. Accordingly, I conclude \nhe has not carried his burden of showing that it is clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant him eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nAs required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, I make the following \nformal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): AGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a \u2013 1.o: \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.p:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n\n \n6\nConclusion \n \n \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance.

Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.  \nStatement of the Case \nOn April 27, 2018, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility \n(DOD CAF) issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security \nconcerns under Guideline F, financial considerations. The action was taken under \nExecutive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \n(February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) effective within the DOD on June 8, 2017. \nApplicant answered the SOR on May 23, 2018, and requested a hearing before an \nadministrative judge. The case was assigned to me on October 1, 2018. The Defense \nOffice of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing on October 12, 2018. \nI convened the hearing as scheduled on November 7, 2018. The Government offered \n01/02/2019\n\n \n2 \n \n \nexhibits (GE) 1 through 4. Applicant testified and offered Exhibits (AE) A through E. There \nwere no objections and the all exhibits were admitted into evidence. The record was held \nopen until December 20, 2018, to allow Applicant to submit additional documents. He \nprovided documents AE F through P, which were admitted without objection, and the \nrecord closed.1 DOHA received the hearing transcript on November 16, 2018.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant admitted all of the SOR allegations. After a thorough and careful review \nof the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact. \n \n \nApplicant is 46 years old. He is divorced with no children. In 1994, two months \nafter completing his bachelor\u2019s degree at a prestigious university, he enlisted in the Army. \nThe Army paid his college student loans. He served as an Army Ranger and was \nhonorably discharged in 2000 in the paygrade of E-6. He has been employed since \napproximately September 2014. He estimated his take-home salary is about $66,000.2 \n \n \nApplicant was preparing to attend graduate school in 2001 when he was contacted \nby his former Army Ranger commander. The commander was soliciting former Rangers \nto reenlist after the 9/11 terrorist attacks. Applicant testified, he had a choice of going to \ngraduate school or going back on active duty to serve his country. He chose the latter. \nHe served from January 2002 until he was discharged in November 2007 in the paygrade \nE-7.3  \n \n \nWhile serving in the Army, Applicant was deployed to Iraq four times. He earned \nthree Bronze Star Medals. His first Bronze Star was for service from July 2004 to \nNovember 2004. He was the senior communications soldier for Special Forces Group \nand participated in sensitive site exploitation and multiple sniper missions in support of \nthe coalition operations within Al Fallujah and during the offensive in An Najaf.4  \n \nThe second Bronze Star was for service from December 2005 to April 2006, as the \ncommunications chief for an operational base in Iraq, during Operation IRAQI FREEDOM. \nHis unrelenting dedication, professionalism, and competence throughout the deployment \nled to successful command and control over 84 combat missions against time-sensitive \nmid to high-level targets. He deployed into insurgent-held territory with assault forces on \n45 direct action raids in order to provide security for the command and control element \nand maintain communications. These raids resulted in the capture of 171 insurgents to \ninclude the successful rescue of an Iraqi General. He was chosen as the primary \n                                                          \n1 Hearing Exhibit (HE) I is Government Counsel\u2019s discovery memorandum. HE II through V are email \ncorrespondence and responses from Government Counsel noting there were no objections to any of \nApplicant\u2019s additional exhibits. \n \n2 Tr. 17-19, 21-23. \n \n3 Tr. 19-23. \n \n4 Tr. 23; AE A. \n\n \n3 \n \n \ncommunicator for a combat search and rescue team supporting the visit to Iraq of the \nVice President of the United States.5  \n \nThe third Bronze Star is listed in Applicant\u2019s DD 214 discharge documents. He \nstated that he did not have a copy of the write-up and had ordered it from the military \nrecords repository, but had not received it before the record closed. He stated this Bronze \nStar was for running combat operations and intelligence assets. Other awards Applicant \nreceived were the Army Commendation Medal; Army Achievement Medal (three awards); \nNavy Unit Commendation Medal; Army Good Conduct Award (three awards); National \nDefense Service Medal; Armed Forces Expeditionary Medal; Global War on Terrorism \nExpeditionary Medal; Global War on Terrorism Service Medal; Iraq Campaign Medal; Non \nCommissioned Officer Professional Development Ribbon (third award); Army Service \nRibbon; Combat Infantryman Badge; Special Forces Tab; Expert Infantryman Badge; \nPathfinder Badge; Master Parachutist Badge; Senior Parachutist Badge; Military Free Fall \nParachutist Badge; Basic Parachutist Badge; and the Royal Thai Army Airborne Wings.6 \nApplicant also received the Army Valorous Unit Award, the second highest unit award, \ngiven for extraordinary heroism in action against an armed enemy of the United States in \na single action or short period of time. It is the unit award equivalent of earning a Silver \nStar for an individual action.7  \n \n \nAfter being discharged from active duty, Applicant resumed his education and \nattended graduate school from 2009 to 2011, earning a master\u2019s degree. He funded his \npost-graduate education through the GI Bill. Applicant was then accepted into a \nprestigious foreign university where he had the opportunity to complete his master\u2019s in \nbusiness degree in one year. He chose this university because of the quality of education \nand because most domestic programs were two years long. Part of his tuition was funded \nthrough the GI Bill, but he also obtained student loans.8  \n \n \nUpon completion of his master\u2019s in business, Applicant returned to the United \nStates and attempted to find a job. He testified that despite the publicity about hiring \nveterans, he was unable to find a job. He explained that many employers did not know \nhow to interpret his military experience. He was unemployed for over 17 months. He \nworked in a factory earning minimum wage. He was forced to live a meager existence. \nHe could not pay his student loans. He used credit cards to provide for his necessities. \nHe contacted a military friend who took Applicant\u2019s resume to a former group commander \nand was hired as a government contractor and moved to the new location. He admitted \nhe was overwhelmed by his debts. He testified he eventually realized he needed to get \nhis life in order.9  \n                                                          \n5 AE A. \n \n6 AE A, J. \n \n7 AE A, L; HE VI. \n \n8 Tr. 26-29. \n \n9 Tr. 26-31, 42-43. \n\n \n4 \n \n \n \nThe debts alleged in the SOR are supported by Applicant\u2019s admissions and credit \nreports from October 2015 and March 2018.10 \n \n \nApplicant enrolled in a rehabilitation program for his student loan debt alleged in \nSOR \u00b6 1.a. He now has an automatic monthly repayment plan where he pays $499 a \nmonth, which began in November 2018. He is resolving his student loans.11  \n \nThe debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.c are credit cards Applicant used when he was \nunemployed. He testified he paid them for as long as he could, but then could no longer \nafford to make the payments. He has since consolidated the debts and arranged \nautomatic monthly payments of $895. He began these payments in July 2018. He \nprovided proof of payments.12  \n \nApplicant recently made arrangements with the creditor in SOR \u00b61.d to make \nautomatic monthly payments of $300. He provided proof of the agreement.13  \n  \n \nApplicant is looking for a second job as a consultant to supplement his income and \nexpedite his repayment of his debts. He provided copies of outstanding evaluations from \nhis job. He accepts full responsibility for failing to timely address his delinquent debts. He \nexplained that in addition to his unemployment, he was overwhelmed with the amount he \nowed. He credibly testified that this debt has left a \u201cstain\u201d on his life and he committed to \nresolving it.14   \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \n                                                          \n10 GE 1, 2, 3, 4. \n \n11 Tr. 34-41; AE D, M, O, P. \n \n12 Tr. 31, 44-46; AE C, F, P.  \n \n13 Tr. 32-33.AE G, N, P. \n \n14 Tr. 23, 40-41, 46; AE E. \n\n \n5 \n \n \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set out \nin AG & 18:  \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \n\n \n6 \n \n \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n \nAG \u00b6 19 provides conditions that could raise security concerns. The following are \npotentially applicable:  \n \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \n \nApplicant has delinquent debts and student loans that he failed to pay for several \nyears. There is sufficient evidence to support the application of the above disqualifying \nconditions. \n \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.  \n \n \nApplicant has several delinquent debts and student loans that are recent and \nongoing. AG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply. \n \n \nApplicant attributed his financial problems to his inability to find a job \ncommensurate with his education after completing his schooling. He was paid minimum \nwage and could not afford to pay his living expenses or begin to repay his student loans. \nDespite his veteran status and prestigious educational resume, it was not until he \ncontacted a friend from the military that he was hired for a job that had better pay. These \n\n \n7 \n \n \nwere conditions beyond Applicant\u2019s control. For the full application of AG \u00b6 20(b), \nApplicant must have acted responsibly. He began working at a better paying job in late \n2014. He did not begin to resolve his delinquent debts and student loans until 2018. He \nwas understandably overwhelmed by the amount of money he owed, but did not act \nresponsibly after he was employed. AG \u00b6 20(b) has some application.  \n \n \nThere is no evidence Applicant received financial counseling. AG \u00b6 20(c) does not \napply. Applicant is repaying all of the SOR debts. He completed a rehabilitation program \nfor his student loans and has an automatic monthly payment arrangement. He also has \nautomatic monthly payment arrangements for the other debts alleged in the SOR. AG \u00b6 \n20(d) applies.  \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \n \n \nApplicant is 46 years old. He had difficulty finding a job after completing a post-\ngraduate degree, accumulated credit card debts, and was unable to pay his student loans. \nI have considered his debts were not for living beyond his means, but rather for \nnecessities. It is apparent that the amount he owed was overwhelming. Applicant now \nhas payment plans for all of his debts and student loans and for more than minimal \namounts. I found Applicant\u2019s testimony credible and believe he is committed to resolving \nall of his debts. I have given considerable weight to Applicant\u2019s interrupted career path \nand life choices made after 9/11 to serve our country, thereby postponing potential career \nopportunities. I do not believe that Applicant\u2019s finances are a security concern. He has \n\n \n8 \n \n \nmet his burden of persuasion. The record evidence leaves me with no questions or doubts \nas to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant mitigated the security concerns arising under Guideline F, financial \nconsiderations. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.d: \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national security to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance. \nEligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nCarol G.

Eligibility for a security clearance is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn December 7, 2016, Applicant applied for a security clearance and submitted \nan Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-QIP) version of a Security \nClearance Application. On an unspecified date, the Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals (DOHA) issued him a set of interrogatories. He responded to those \ninterrogatories, but he failed to date his response. On June 11, 2018, the Department of \nDefense (DOD) Consolidated Adjudications Facility (CAF) issued a Statement of \nReasons (SOR) to him, under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended and modified; \nDOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(January 2, 1992), as amended and modified (Directive); and Directive 4 of the Security \nExecutive Agent (SEAD 4), National Security Adjudicative Guidelines (December 10, \n2016) (AG) for all covered individuals who require initial or continued eligibility for access \nto classified information or eligibility to hold a sensitive position, effective June 8, 2017. \n01/31/2019\n\n \n2 \n                                      \n \nThe SOR alleged security concerns under Guidelines J (Criminal Conduct) and E \n(Personal Conduct), and detailed reasons why the DOD adjudicators were unable to find \nthat it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security \nclearance for Applicant. The SOR recommended referral to an administrative judge to \ndetermine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.  \n \n \nIt is unclear as to when Applicant received the SOR as there is no receipt in the \ncase file. In a sworn statement, dated July 9, 2018, Applicant responded to the SOR and \nelected to have his case decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. A complete \ncopy of the Government\u2019s file of relevant material (FORM) was mailed to Applicant by \nDOHA on August 10, 2018, and he was afforded an opportunity to file objections and \nsubmit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation. In addition to the FORM, \nApplicant was furnished a copy of the Directive as well as the Adjudicative Guidelines \napplicable to his case. Applicant received the FORM on October 1, 2018. Applicant\u2019s \nresponse was due within 30 days of the receipt of the FORM. Applicant apparently chose \nnot to respond to the FORM, for as of January 29, 2019, he had not done so. The case \nwas assigned to me on January 25, 2019.   \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted with comments all of the factual \nallegations pertaining to criminal conduct in the SOR (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. through 1.i.), but he \nfailed to admit or deny the cross-allegations pertaining to personal conduct (SOR \u00b6 2.a), \nso a denial was registered for him. Applicant\u2019s admissions and comments are \nincorporated herein as findings of fact. After a complete and thorough review of the \nevidence in the record, and upon due consideration of same, I make the following \nadditional findings of fact:  \n \nApplicant is a 35-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been serving \nas a condenser maintenance worker with his current employer since July 2017. A 2001 \nhigh school graduate, Applicant earned college and vocational credits but no degree. He \nenlisted in the U.S. Navy in September 2001, and served on active duty until September \n2009, when he was honorably discharged. He remained in the active reserve, with \ndeployments to Guam and Afghanistan, and he re-enlisted on active duty in November \n2014. Applicant was discharged in April 2016, and he was issued a general discharge \nunder honorable conditions. He was granted a secret clearance in 2004. Applicant has \nnever married. He has no children. \n \nCriminal Conduct and Personal Conduct \n \nIn part, because of Applicant\u2019s consumption of alcohol, he has a lengthy history of \ndisregarding laws, rules, and regulations. The SOR alleged nine incidents of criminality \nand personal conduct by Applicant commencing in 2003, and continuing until at least \n2017.  \n \n(SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a.): In March 2003, when he was a 19-year-old seaman (E-3), Applicant \nreceived non-judicial punishment for violation of Article 91 (Disrespect toward Superior \n\n \n3 \n                                      \n \nPetty Officer), Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ). He was restricted to the vessel \nfor five days. Applicant denied, and there is no independent evidence to the contrary, that \nhe was reduced in rank as alleged in the SOR, although Applicant caused some \ncontroversy initially by saying the allegation was accurate. He described the episode \nleading up to his discipline, as follows: He was sitting with his roommate during lunch \nwhen he got up to obtain some additional beverage, but when he returned, someone was \nsitting in his place, although Applicant\u2019s full tray of food was still unmoved. He asked the \nindividual to move so he could finish his meal and was told to wait because the individual \nwas talking to someone. Applicant placed his hands under the individual\u2019s armpits to \nassist him out of the seat. Applicant was not aware of the individual\u2019s rank at the time. \nWith added maturity, Applicant realized that he could have handled the situation better by \nsimply moving his seat to finish his lunch.1 \n \n (SOR \u00b6 1.b.): In September 2007, Applicant was arrested and charged with \nDriving While Intoxicated (DWI) \u2013 1st offense, a misdemeanor. Although the Federal \nBureau of Investigation (FBI) Identification Record reported that he was convicted of the \ncharge on November 7, 2007, and sentenced to 12 months and 5 days, with 12 months \nsuspended, along with unsupervised probation, Applicant stated, and the SOR alleged, \nthat he was sentenced to 10 days in jail.2 The trial court apparently also mandated that \nApplicant install an ignition interlock or car breathalyzer,3 suspended his operator\u2019s \nlicense for one year, and ordered him to attend an Alcohol Safety Action Program \n(ASAP).4 Applicant described the events leading up to his arrest: He had attended a \nfriend\u2019s promotion party-cookout, consumed three of four mixed vodka drinks, and then \nwent to another event that was motorcycle-related. That event became somewhat \nraucous, and when the police arrived, everyone departed. Applicant was stopped one \nblock from the party and administered a sobriety test, which he failed.5  \n \n(SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c., 1.d., and 1.e.): As noted above, because of the court sentence \nassociated with Applicant\u2019s September 2007 DWI, he was required to attend ASAP. He \nrepeatedly failed to do so, claiming that he did not have sufficient funds available because \nof the costs associated with the ignition interlock, attorney and court fees, and his \nincreased insurance costs.6 In March 2008, he was required to show cause on a charge \nof ASAP Non-Comply. On April 24, 2008, he entered a plea of guilty and was ordered to \npay court costs of $76. He paid his court costs in March 2009.7 In September 2008, he \n                                                          \n1 Item 4 (Applicant\u2019s Response to the Interrogatories, undated, at 4; Item 2, (Applicant\u2019s Answer to \nthe SOR, dated July 9, 2018), at 1. \n    \n2 Item 6 (FBI Identification Record, dated December 9, 2016, at 2). \n \n3 Such a device prevents drunk drivers from driving their vehicle. It is connected to the vehicle, and \nit has a preset level for blood alcohol concentration (BAC) determined by the state. If a would-be driver \nblows into the device when he or she is over the set BAC limit, the vehicle will not start. \n \n4 Item 4 (Enhanced Subject Interview, dated October 13, 2017), at 10-11. \n  \n5 Item 4 (Interview), supra note 4, at 10-11. \n \n6 Item 2, supra note 1, at 1. \n \n\n \n4 \n                                      \n \nwas again required to show cause on a charge of ASAP Non-Comply. On May 7, 2009, \nhe entered a plea of not guilty, but was found guilty, and he was ordered to pay court \ncosts of $76. He paid his court costs in December 2009.8 In May 2010, he was again \nrequired to show cause on a charge of ASAP Non-Comply. On June 24, 2010, he entered \na plea of not guilty, but was found guilty. The case was immediately appealed,9 because \nApplicant claimed that he had actually fulfilled his ASAP obligation.10  \n \n(SOR \u00b6 1.f.): In October 2015, Applicant was charged with DWI \u2013 2nd offense, a \nmisdemeanor. On January 4, 2016, he was found guilty and sentenced to 60 days (50 \ndays suspended), fined $500, ordered to pay $296 in court costs, and his operator\u2019s \nlicense was restricted for three years, commencing on January 4, 2016. He paid his fine \nand court costs on April 7, 2016.11 Applicant described the events leading up to his arrest: \nA girlfriend was being transferred so a group of friends decided to take her out. One of \nthe friends \u2013 a designated sober driver \u2013 got angry towards the end of the evening and \nas she was departing in another vehicle, she threw Applicant\u2019s keys out the window to \nhim, leaving him without a designated driver. Although Applicant denied being intoxicated, \nhe drove the vehicle away, and was stopped. He acknowledged that he made an \nirresponsible decision.12 \n \n(SOR \u00b6 1.g.): In March 2016, Applicant was charged with Contempt of Court, a \nmisdemeanor.13 Applicant\u2019s descriptions associated with this incident are somewhat \ninconsistent. He initially claimed it was about a missed court date, but later claimed that \nthe charge was associated with his failure to enroll in ASAP by a certain date. He \ndisplayed proof that he was enrolled in a class that was scheduled to commence in April \n2016. The charge was eventually dismissed on July 25, 2016.14  \n \n(SOR \u00b6 1.h.): In March 2016, Applicant received non-judicial punishment for \nviolation of Article 92 (Failure to Obey a Lawful Order), UCMJ. The charge was related to \nhis October 2015 DWI. He was restricted to the vessel for 45 days and reduced from E-6 \nto E-5. Applicant was also notified that he was to be administratively processed for \ndischarge.15  \n \n                                                          \n7 Item 5 (Traffic/Criminal Case Details, dated March 25, 2009). \n \n8 Item 5 (Traffic/Criminal Case Details, dated December 17, 2009). \n \n9 Item 5 (Traffic/Criminal Case Details, dated June 24, 2010). \n \n10 Item 2, supra note 1, at 1; Item 4 (Interview), supra note 4, at 11. \n \n11 Item 5 (Traffic/Criminal Case Details, dated April 7, 2016); Item 6, supra note 2. \n \n12 Item 2, supra note 1, at 2; Item 4 (Interview), supra note 4, at 7-8. \n \n13 Item 6, supra note 2. \n \n14 Item 6, supra note 2; Item 2, supra note 1, at 2; Item 4 (Interview), supra note 4, at 13. \n \n15 Item 4 (Interview), supra note 4, at 13; Item 2, supra note 1, at 2. \n\n \n5 \n                                      \n \n(SOR \u00b6 1.i.): In February 2017, Applicant was charged with Operating \nSuspended/Revoked, a misdemeanor, essentially driving after a forfeiture of an \noperator\u2019s license. On March 17, 2017, he was convicted as charged and sentenced to \n30 days (suspended), 3 additional months of suspension, fined $250, and ordered to pay \n$91 in court costs. He paid his fine and court costs on June 7, 2017.16 Applicant described \nthe events leading up to his arrest: Because he could no longer afford to reside in his \nhome, and he was unable to find someone to assist him in moving his belongings to \nstorage, he moved them himself on two trips. On the third trip, he was stopped by the \nsame officer who had stopped him in October 2015. Applicant acknowledged that he \nmade a foolish decision.17 \n \nApplicant contended that he completed a four-week ASAP in May 2016, and that \nas of October 2017, he was still participating in another 18-week class that was \ntemporarily interrupted by a job-related trip to sea. He failed to submit any documents to \nsupport his contentions related to his attendance or completion of the ASAP programs. \nHe denied ever being diagnosed for any alcohol-related condition. He also finally realized \nthat drinking and driving resulted in his having to pay expensive fines, and that is \nsomething he no longer wishes to do. Although he used to drink three to four mixed \nvodkas during the weekends, he now claims that, as of September 2017, he stopped \nconsuming alcohol.18 \n \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d19 As Commander in Chief, the President has \nthe authority to control access to information bearing on national security and to \ndetermine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such \ninformation. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to \ngrant an applicant eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that \nit is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d20   \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the guidelines in SEAD 4. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the guidelines list potentially disqualifying \nconditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility \nfor access to classified information. \n                                                          \n16 Item 5 (Traffic/Criminal Case Details, dated June 7, 2017); Item 2, supra note 1, at 3. \n \n17 Item 2, supra note 1, at 3. \n \n18 Item 4 (Interview), supra note 4, at 14. \n \n19 Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). \n \n20 Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as \namended and modified.    \n \n\n \n6 \n                                      \n \nAn administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules \nof law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known \nas the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a meaningful decision. \n \nIn the decision-making process, facts must be established by \u201csubstantial \nevidence.\u201d21 The Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish \na potentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced \nsubstantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant \nhas the burden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, extenuation \nor mitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government\u2019s case. The \nburden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government.22  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well. It is \nbecause of this special relationship that the Government must be able to repose a high \ndegree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to classified \ninformation. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. Such \ndecisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather \nthan actual, risk of compromise of classified information.  Furthermore, \u201csecurity \nclearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d23  \n \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense \nbe a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d24 Thus, nothing in this \ndecision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole or in \npart, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or \npatriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has or has not met the strict guidelines \nthe President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.  In \nreaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, \n                                                          \n21 \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as \nadequate to support a conclusion in light of all contrary evidence in the record.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 04-11463 \nat 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1).  \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla \nbut less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. \n1994). \n \n22 See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \n \n23 Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n \n24 See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \n \n\n \n7 \n                                      \n \nand based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing \ninferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nAnalysis \n \nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all \nappropriate legal precepts and factors, I conclude the following with respect to the \nallegations set forth in the SOR: \n \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Criminal Conduct is set out in AG \n\u00b6 30: Criminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person's ability or willingness to \ncomply with laws, rules, and regulations. \n \nThe guideline notes conditions under AG \u00b6 31 that could raise security concerns: \n \n(a) a pattern of minor offenses, any one of which on its own would be \nunlikely to affect a national security eligibility decision, but which in \ncombination cast doubt on the individual's judgment, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness;  \n \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted; \n \n(d) violation or revocation of parole or probation, or failure to complete a \ncourt-mandated rehabilitation program; and \n \n(e) discharge or dismissal from the Armed Forces for reasons less than \n\"Honorable.\" \n  \nIn 2003, Applicant was disciplined for disrespect toward a superior petty officer. \nBetween 2007 and 2017, Applicant established a lengthy pattern of criminality involving \nrepeated traffic-related violations for which he was charged, convicted, and fined. He was \nconvicted on two occasions of DWI. His repeated failures to timely complete ASAP \nresulted in three incidents where he was required to show cause on charges of ASAP \nnon-comply and one charge of contempt of court. His most recent violation was for \noperating a vehicle on a suspended license. Applicant was discharged from the U.S. \nNavy, and he was issued a general discharge under honorable conditions \u2013 a level lower \nthan honorable. His operator\u2019s license is still suspended. AG \u00b6\u00b6 31(a), 31(b), 31(d), and \n31(e) have been established. \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions under AG \u00b6 32 that could \nmitigate security concerns arising from criminal conduct. They include: \n \n\n \n8 \n                                      \n \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n \n(c) no reliable evidence to support that the individual committed the offense;  \nand  \n \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited \nto, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \n \nAG \u00b6 32(a) applies solely to Applicant\u2019s 2003 incident, an action that occurred \nwhen he was a 19-year-old seaman, and the circumstances are both unusual and unlikely \nto recur. As for the remaining allegations, none of the mitigating conditions apply. \nApplicant\u2019s continuing unwillingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations is \ntroubling, for he routinely ignores the law when he consistently drives a vehicle without a \nlicense, or when it has been suspended or revoked. While Applicant routinely \nacknowledges his criminal conduct and recognizes his irresponsible and foolish \ndecisions, he simply continues to repeat them. Under these circumstances, there is little, \nif any, evidence of rehabilitation. While a person should not be held forever accountable \nfor misconduct from the past, in this instance, the criminal conduct is routinely continuing. \nGiven his cavalier attitude towards laws, rules, and regulations, Applicant\u2019s history of \ncriminal conduct, under the circumstances, continues to cast doubt on his reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment. \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in \nAG \u00b6 15: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. The following will normally result in \nan unfavorable national security eligibility determination, security clearance \naction, or cancellation of further processing for national security eligibility: \n \n(a) refusal, or failure without reasonable cause, to undergo or \ncooperate with security processing, including but not limited \nto meeting with a security investigator for subject interview, \ncompleting security forms or releases, cooperation with \n\n \n9 \n                                      \n \nmedical \nor \npsychological \nevaluation, \nor \npolygraph \nexamination, if authorized and required; and \n \n(b) refusal to provide full, frank, and truthful answers to lawful \nquestions of investigators, security officials, or other official \nrepresentatives in connection with a personnel security or \ntrustworthiness determination. \n \nMy discussion related to Applicant\u2019s criminal conduct is adopted herein. Applicant\u2019s \ncontinuing \u2013 at least until the most recent incident of February 2017 \u2013 unwillingness to \ncomply with laws, rules, and regulations is troubling. With respect to the incidents of \ncriminal-personal conduct discussed above, the general concern of questionable \njudgment, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations set forth in AG \u00b6 15 has \nbeen established.  \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions under AG \u00b6 17 that could \nmitigate security concerns arising from personal conduct. They include: \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to \nrecur; and \n \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability \nto exploitation, manipulation, or duress. \n \nFor the reasons set forth above, as it pertains to the 2003 incident, AG \u00b6 17(c) \napplies solely to that incident. However, because of Applicant\u2019s continuing unwillingness \nto comply with laws, rules, and regulations, especially related to the unlawful driving \nissues, as well as his failures to timely complete ASAP, AG \u00b6 17(c) does not apply. \nAlthough Applicant routinely acknowledged his criminal conduct and recognized his \nirresponsible and foolish decisions, he nevertheless continued to repeat them as recently \nas February 2017. Although he claimed to have successfully completed at least one \nASAP, and claimed that he was in the process of completing another ASAP, Applicant \nfailed to submit any documentation to support his claims. Furthermore, while he claimed \nto have taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate the factors that contributed to his \nbehavior, to wit: he stopped consuming alcohol, he offered no documentary evidence to \nsupport that claim. Under these circumstances, AG \u00b6\u00b6 17(d) and 17(e) have not been \nestablished. Applicant\u2019s actions under the circumstances continue to cast doubt on his \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. \n \n\n \n10 \n                                      \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(d): \n \n (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Moreover, I have \nevaluated the various aspects of this case in light of the totality of the record evidence \nand have not merely performed a piecemeal analysis.25  \n  \nThere is some evidence mitigating Applicant\u2019s conduct. Applicant is a 35-year-old \nemployee of a defense contractor, serving as a condenser maintenance worker with his \ncurrent employer since July 2017. He served in an enlisted capacity with the U.S. Navy \non active duty or in the active reserve from September 2001 until April 2016; was \ndeployed to Guam and Afghanistan; and received an honorable discharge in September \n2009. He was granted a secret clearance in 2004.  \n \nThe disqualifying evidence under the whole-person concept is more substantial. \nDuring a 10-year period starting in 2007, Applicant was convicted of two DWIs; one \noperating a vehicle with a suspended license; charged three times with failing to comply \nwith ASAP participation; and disciplined under Article 15, UCMJ, for failure to obey a \nlawful order. In addition, because of his lengthy period of repeated misconduct, in April \n2016, he received a general discharge under honorable conditions. Applicant\u2019s operator\u2019s \nlicense is still suspended. \n \nOverall, the evidence leaves me with substantial questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all of these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has failed to mitigate the security concerns arising from his financial \nconsiderations. See SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6\u00b6 2(d)(1) through AG 2(d)(9). \n \n \n \n                                                          \n25 See U.S. v.

Jun. 2, 2006). \n \n\n \n11 \n                                      \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline J:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a.:  \n \n \nFor Applicant  \nSubparagraphs 1.b. through 1.i.:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a.:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \n In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

Eligibility for access to classified information \nis denied. \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on July 18, 2016. On \nApril 25, 2018, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility (DOD \nCAF) sent her a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging security concerns under \nGuidelines F and E. The DOD CAF acted under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) \npromulgated in Security Executive Agent Directive 4, National Security Adjudicative \nGuidelines (December 10, 2016), for all adjudicative decisions on or after June 8, 2017. \nApplicant answered the SOR on June 21, 2018, and requested a hearing before \nan administrative judge. Department Counsel was ready to proceed on July 27, 2018, \n12/27/2018\n\n \n2 \n \nand the case was assigned to me on September 11, 2018. On September 20, 2018, the \nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) notified Applicant that the hearing was \nscheduled for October 25, 2018. I convened the hearing as scheduled. Government \nExhibits (GX) 1 through 4 were admitted in evidence without objection. Applicant testified \nand submitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AX) A through I, which were admitted without \nobjection. I kept the record open until November 16, 2018, to enable her to submit \nadditional documentary evidence. She submitted AX J,1 K, and L, which were received \nwithout objection. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on November 2, 2018. \n \nFindings of Fact2 \n \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, she admitted the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.f, \n1.h-1.l, 1.n, 2.a, and 2.b.3 She denied the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.g and 1.m. Her \nadmissions in her answer and at the hearing are incorporated in my findings of fact. I \ngranted Department Counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw the allegation in SOR \u00b6 1.i as a \nduplicate of SOR \u00b6 1.b. (Tr. 17.) \n \n \nApplicant is a 57-year-old information technology (IT) technician employed by \nfederal contractors since April 2011, with a period of unemployment and intermittent \nemployment from November 2015 to March 2016. She has held a security clearance \nsince March 2012.  \n \n \nApplicant married in April 1990 and separated in April 1998. Her spouse is \nincarcerated. She has three children, ages 35, 28, and 26. She is a high-school graduate \nand is attending a community college, working toward a professional certification. (Tr. 34-\n35.) \n \nApplicant served on active duty in the U.S. Army from November 1980 to March \n1997 and was honorably discharged based on family hardship. She worked in the private \nsector from May 1997 to July 2010 and was unemployed from July 2010 until she began \nworking for a federal contractor in April 2011. \n \n \nApplicant testified that she left her job in November 2015 and moved to another \nstate to get away from a difficult customer of her employer. She testified that everyone in \nher family was debt-free, she was intrigued by another city, and she wanted to get away \nand be alone for a while. (Tr. 39.). She supported herself with income from intermittent \nemployment, a substantial inheritance, and her military disability pay. (Tr. 41.) She \n                                                          \n1 AX J indicates that it is one of two pages, but Applicant sent only the first page. \n \n2 Applicant\u2019s personal information is extracted from her SCA (GX 1) unless otherwise indicated by a \nparenthetical citation to the record. \n \n3 Applicant admitted that she incorrectly answered \u201cNo\u201d to two financial questions in her SCA, but she \ndenied that she was aware of the judgment alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.e and the delinquent debts alleged in SOR \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.d and 1.f-1.k. I have treated her responses to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a and 2.b as denials. \n\n \n3 \n \nreturned to her current state of domicile and began working for her current employer in \nAugust 2017. (Tr. 36.). \n \n \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant failed to timely file her federal and state tax returns, \nthat she owes federal and state taxes totaling about $7,000, and that she has 11 other \ndelinquent debts totaling about $19,720. Her delinquent debts are reflected in credit \nreports from September 2016 (GX 2) and February 2018 (GX 3). The evidence \nconcerning the allegations in the SOR is summarized below. \n \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 1.d, 1.g, and 1.k: medical bills placed for collection of $2,495; \n$202; $10; $268; and $28. Applicant testified that she disputed these bills because she \nwas hospitalized for only two hours and she had medical insurance. She testified that she \ncontacted the medical provider and disputed the bills by telephone, but she did not reduce \nher dispute to writing. (Tr. 44-45.)  \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.c: cable-service bill placed for collection of $71. Applicant has taken \nno action to resolve this debt. (Tr. 46-47.) \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.d: collection account for $10. Applicant has taken no action to resolve \nthis debt. (Tr. 47.) \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.e: judgment for medical debt filed in 2015 for $289. Applicant was \nunaware that this judgment was entered, because she was living in another state when it \nwas filed. She paid it in full in November 2015. (AX A.) \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.f: debt for time-share property charged off for $15,811. Applicant \ntestified that she contacted the property manager and indicated that she wanted to \ndispose of this property, but she has taken no further action to sell it or resolve the debt. \n(Tr. 48-49.) \n \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.h and 1.j: utility bill placed for collection of $204 and cable bill \nplaced for collection of $140. Applicant testified that she incurred these bills while living \nin another state. She has not contacted the creditors or made any effort to resolve these \ndebts. (Tr. 45-46.) \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.l: failure to timely file federal income tax returns for 2014, 2015, and \n2016). Applicant timely filed her federal returns for 2013 and 2014. (AX B at 5-7.) She \nfiled her federal income tax returns for 2015 and 2016 in August 2018. (AX B at 9-11; AX \nE; AX F.)  \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.m: failure to file state income tax returns for 2014, 2015, 2016.4 As of \nthe date the record closed, Applicant had not filed her past-due state income tax returns \n                                                          \n4 I granted Department Counsel\u2019s motion to amend SOR \u00b6 1.m to add an allegation of failure to file a state \nincome tax return for tax year 2013, delete the allegation of failure to file for 2015 and 2016, and amend \nthe state for which returns were required. (Tr. 65-68.) \n\n \n4 \n \nfor 2013 and 2014. (Tr. 31-32.) A state tax lien for $3,428 was filed against her in \nSeptember 2018 for taxes due for tax years 2010, 2011, and 2013. (AX H.) The lien has \nnot been satisfied. \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.n: tax debt totaling $7,000 for federal and state income taxes for \n2014, 2015, and 2016. Applicant\u2019s IRS tax transcript for tax year 2013 reflects a tax debt \nof $7,475. (AX B at 5.) In January 2018, she told a security investigator that the IRS \ncalculated her tax debt based on her receipt of an inheritance. (GX 4 at 4.) She did not \nproduce any documentation from the IRS stating the specific basis for recalculating her \ntax debt for 2013. The IRS tax transcript for 2014 reflects that she owed $1,634 for that \nyear. (AX B at 7.) The transcript for 2015 reflects a zero balance, and the transcript for \n2016 reflects a balance of $2,671. In October 2018, she wrote two letters to the IRS, \nchallenging the computation of her federal income tax for 2013. (AX C; AX D; AX G.) \nThere is no response from the IRS in the record.  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s father passed away in September 2011, and she was the appointed to \nadminister his estate. She opened the estate in January 2012 and completed the \ndistribution of assets by the end of 2012. (Attachment to SOR answer.) She received \nabout $250,000. She distributed part of her inheritance by giving her mother $42,000, \ngiving her sons $10,000 each, and spending a substantial sum (an amount not specifically \nreflected in the record) on renovating and improving her home. (Tr. 53-54.) Although she \nhired an accountant and an attorney to help her administer the estate, she has not sought \nprofessional help in resolving the dispute with the IRS. (Tr. 54-57.) She has never sought \nor received financial counseling. (Tr. 76.) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s take-home pay is about $3,500 per month. She receives $1,100 per \nmonth in disability pay related to her military service. Her monthly expenses are about \n$3,280. She has no retirement accounts and no savings. (Tr. 71-72.) She testified that \nshe has a net monthly remainder of about $1,500. (Tr. 73.) She submitted a budget sheet \nafter the hearing, reflecting monthly expenses of about $3,320. (AX I.) \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, she stated that she was unaware of the \njudgment for the medical debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.e, because she was living in another \nstate when it was filed. At the hearing, she testified that she was unaware of the \ndelinquent debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.d and 1.f-1.k when she submitted her SCA, \nbecause she does not review her credit reports, she had sufficient money, she was not \nborrowing or opening credit accounts, and she \u201cthought that everything was fine.\u201d (Tr. 79.) \n \nPolicies \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \n\n \n5 \n \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2.  \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \n \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr.20, 2016).   \n \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \n \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n \n\n \n6 \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18:  \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . . \n \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the documentary evidence establish the following \ndisqualifying conditions under this guideline:  \n \nAG \u00b6 19(a): inability to satisfy debts; \n \nAG \u00b6 19(b): unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; \n \nAG \u00b6 19(c): a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n \nAG \u00b6 19(f): failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local \nincome tax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax as required. \n \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable:  \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n\n \n7 \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c): the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling \nfor the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \ncredit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem \nis being resolved or is under control; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts;  \n \nAG \u00b6 20(e): the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy \nof the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue; and \n \nAG \u00b6 20(g): the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a) is not established. Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts are numerous, recent, \nand were not incurred under circumstances making recurrence unlikely. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b) may be applicable to the federal tax debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.n, if it is \nbased on a miscalculation by the IRS of Applicant\u2019s income. She procrastinated in \nchallenging the IRS calculation until she realized in January 2018 that it raised security \nconcerns. She eventually acted responsibly by challenging the IRS decision in October \n2018.  \n \n \nThis mitigating condition is not established for the other debts alleged in the SOR. \nApplicant\u2019s unemployment and intermittent employment from November 2015 to March \n2016 were voluntary, motivated by her desire for a change of environment. Her separation \nfrom her husband and his incarceration were conditions beyond her control, but they \noccurred in 1998, well before her financial problems began. Furthermore, she has not \nacted responsibly. She returned to full-time employment in March 2016, but she has taken \nno significant action to resolve the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.d and 1.f-1.k. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c) is not established. Applicant has not sought or received financial \ncounseling, and her financial situation is not under control. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d) is established for the judgment alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.e. It is not \nestablished for the other debts alleged in the SOR. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(e) is established for the federal tax debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.n, but not for \nthe other debts alleged in the SOR. Although she admitted the multiple medical debts in \nher answer to the SOR, she disputed them at the hearing. However, she has not filed \ndisputes with the medical providers, her insurance company, the collection agencies, or \nthe credit bureaus. \n \n\n \n8 \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(g) is not fully established. Applicant filed the past-due federal returns for \n2015 and 2016 in August 2018, after she received the SOR, but she has not filed her \nstate returns for 2013 and 2014. She has not resolved the state tax debt. The fact that \nApplicant has filed her past-due federal returns for 2015 and 2016 \u201cdoes not preclude \ncareful consideration of Applicant\u2019s security worthiness based on longstanding prior \nbehavior evidencing irresponsibility.\u201d ISCR Case No. 12-05053 (App. Bd. Oct. 30, 2014). \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \n \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant falsified her SCA by answering \u201cNo\u201d to a question \nwhether she had a judgment entered against her in the previous seven years and failing \nto disclose the judgment alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.e. It also alleges that she falsified her SCA \nby answering \u201cNo\u201d to questions whether, in the past seven years, she had any bills or \ndebts turned over to a collection agency and whether she had any accounts or credit \ncards suspended, charged off, or cancelled for failing to pay as agreed, and failing to \ndisclose the delinquent debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.d and 1.f-1.k. \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 15:  \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. . . .  \n \nThe relevant disqualifying condition is AG \u00b6 16(a):  \n \n[D]eliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \naward benefits or status, determine national security eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \n \nApplicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, explaining that she was unaware of the judgment \nalleged in SOR \u00b6 1.e because she was living in another state at the time it was filed, is \nplausible and consistent with her overall inattention to financial matters. Her explanation \nfor not disclosing the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.d and 1.f-1.k also is plausible and \npersuasive. While she is financially careless and disorganized, she was candid, sincere, \nand persuasive at the hearing. I am satisfied that she did not intentionally falsify her SCA. \nNo disqualifying conditions under this guideline are established. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \n\n \n9 \n \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances and applying the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d).5 I have incorporated \nmy comments under Guidelines F and E in my whole-person analysis and applied the \nadjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). I have considered Applicant\u2019s military service and the \nfact that she has held a security clearance for many years, apparently without incident. \n \n \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guidelines F and \nE, and evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant \nhas refuted the allegation under Guideline F that she failed to timely file her federal \nincome tax return for 2014, and she has refuted the allegations under Guideline E that \nshe falsified her SCA. However, she has not mitigated the security concerns raised by \nher delinquent debts, her failures to timely file her federal returns for 2015 and 2016, and \nher failures to timely file her state returns for 2013 and 2014. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): AGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.d: \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.e:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.f-1.h: \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.i:  \n \n \n \nWithdrawn \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.j-1.k: \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.l:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.m (as amended): \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.n:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n                                                          \n5 The factors are: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding \nthe conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) \nthe presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for \nthe conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of \ncontinuation or recurrence.  \n \n\n \n10 \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E (Personal Conduct):  \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a and 2.b: \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nClearance is denied. \n \n \n \n \nLeRoy F.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact After considering the FORM, which includes Applicant\u2019s response to the SOR as Item 1, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant is 58 years old and has worked for a defense contractor since July 2012. He has not held a DoD security clearance. In June 1981, he married his wife. They have a 35-year-old daughter and a 33-year-old son. (Item 2) From May 2009 until November 2017, he was a pastor. He had previously served as a pastor from June 2001 through October 2008. Between October 2008 and May 2009, he was the Director of Operations for an association of churches. On Applicant\u2019s Electronic Questionnaires for Investigation Processing (e-QIP), he indicated he lived in Canada from August 2012 through November 2017. (Item 2) He estimated his financial problems at $125,000 and listed the reason was because his wife was prohibited from working while they lived in Canada. (Item 2) When interviewed by an authorized investigator for the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) in January 2018, he indicated his wife was now working for a doctor as a medical secretary. (Item 3) On his e- QIP, he indicated the \u201cDebts were forgiven.\u201d He did not further explain this statement or provide documentation supporting this assertion. Applicant\u2019s December 2017 credit report lists the debts in SOR 1.a ($50,658), SOR 1.b ($20,627), SOR 1.c ($15,534), and SOR 1.f ($276) as being in collection.

Henderson, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n______________ \nDecision \n______________ \nHEINY, Claude R., Administrative Judge: \nApplicant owes $105,258 on six delinquent accounts. The obligations remain \nunpaid. He provided no documentation showing any efforts to address the debts. \nClearance is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn April 30, 2018, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility \n(DoD CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, detailing the security \nconcerns under Guideline F, financial considerations, and explaining why it was unable to \nfind it clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue security clearance \neligibility for him. The DoD CAF took the action under Executive Order (EO) 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DoD \nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the National Security Adjudicative \nGuidelines (AG) effective June 8, 2017, for all adjudications for national security eligibility \nor eligibility to hold a sensitive position. \n01/23/2019\n\n2 \n \nOn May 19, 2018, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations and requested a \ndecision on the written record by an administrative judge from the Defense Office of \nHearings and Appeals (DOHA). On June 26, 2018, the Government submitted a File of \nRelevant Material (FORM), consisting of five exhibits (Items 1-5). DOHA forwarded a copy \nof the FORM to Applicant and instructed him to respond within 30 days of receipt. \nApplicant\u2019s response was due on August 12, 2018. No response was received. On October \n26, 2018, I was assigned the case to determine whether it is clearly consistent with national \nsecurity to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.  \n \nEvidentiary Ruling \n \n \nDepartment Counsel submitted as Item 3 a summary of a subject interview of \nApplicant conducted on December 14, 2017. The summary was part of the DoD Report of \nInvestigation (ROI) in Applicant\u2019s case. Under \u00b6 E3.1.20 of the Directive, a DoD personnel \nbackground report of investigation may be received in evidence and considered with an \nauthenticating witness, provided it is otherwise admissible under the Federal Rules of \nEvidence. The interview summary did not bear the authentication required for admissibility \nunder \u00b6 E3.1.20. \n \n \nIn ISCR Case No. 16-03126 decided on January 24, 2018, the Appeal Board held \nthat it was not error for an administrative judge to admit and consider a summary of \npersonal subject interview where the applicant was placed on notice of her opportunity to \nobject to consideration of the summary; the applicant filed no objection to it; and there is no \nindication that the summary contained inaccurate information. In this case, Applicant was \nprovided a copy of the FORM and advised of his opportunity to submit objections or \nmaterial that he wanted the administrative judge to consider. In a footnote, the FORM \nadvised Applicant of the following: \n \nIMPORTANT NOTICE TO APPLICANT: The attached summary of your \nPersonal Subject Interview (PSI) is being provided to the Administrative \nJudge for consideration as part of the record evidence in this case. In your \nresponse to this File of Relevant Material (FORM), you can comment on \nwhether the PSI summary accurately reflects the information you provided to \nthe authorized OPM investigator(s) and you can make any corrections, \nadditions, deletions, and updates necessary to make the summary clear and \naccurate. Alternatively, you can object on the ground that the report is \nunauthenticated by a Government witness. If no objections are raised in your \nresponse to the FORM, or if you do not respond to the FORM, the \nAdministrative Judge may determine that you have waived any objections to \nthe admissibility of the summary and may consider the summary as evidence \nin your case. \n \n \nConcerning whether Applicant understood the meaning of authentication or the legal \nconsequences of waiver, Applicant\u2019s pro se status does not confer any due process rights \nor protections beyond those afforded him if he was represented by legal counsel. He was \nadvised in \u00b6 E3.1.4 of the Directive that he may request a hearing. In \u00b6 E3.1.15, he was \n\n3 \n \nadvised that he is responsible for presenting evidence to rebut, explain, or mitigate facts \nadmitted by him or proven by Department Counsel and that he has the ultimate burden of \npersuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision. While the Directive does not \nspecifically provide for a waiver of the authentication requirement, Applicant was placed on \nsufficient notice of his opportunity to object to the admissibility of the interview summary, to \ncomment on the interview summary, and to make any corrections, deletions, or updates to \nthe information in the report. Applicant is a college graduate, who can reasonably be held \nto have understood the footnote, and he did not object to the PSI or indicate that it \ncontained inaccurate information. Accordingly, I accepted Item 3 in the record, subject to \nissues of relevance and materiality in light of the entire record. \n \nSummary of SOR Allegations \n \n \nThe SOR alleges that, as of April 30, 2018, Applicant had six delinquent obligations \ntotaling more than $105,000. When Applicant answered the SOR, he admitted the \nallegations. He provided no explanation of his delinquent accounts when he responded to \nthe SOR. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nAfter considering the FORM, which includes Applicant\u2019s response to the SOR as \nItem 1, I make the following findings of fact. \n \n \nApplicant is 58 years old and has worked for a defense contractor since July 2012. \nHe has not held a DoD security clearance. In June 1981, he married his wife. They have a \n35-year-old daughter and a 33-year-old son. (Item 2) From May 2009 until November 2017, \nhe was a pastor. He had previously served as a pastor from June 2001 through October \n2008. Between October 2008 and May 2009, he was the Director of Operations for an \nassociation of churches.  \n \n \nOn Applicant\u2019s Electronic Questionnaires for Investigation Processing (e-QIP), he \nindicated he lived in Canada from August 2012 through November 2017. (Item 2) He \nestimated his financial problems at $125,000 and listed the reason was because his wife \nwas prohibited from working while they lived in Canada. (Item 2) When interviewed by an \nauthorized investigator for the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) in January 2018, he \nindicated his wife was now working for a doctor as a medical secretary. (Item 3) On his e-\nQIP, he indicated the \u201cDebts were forgiven.\u201d He did not further explain this statement or \nprovide documentation supporting this assertion. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s December 2017 credit report lists the debts in SOR 1.a ($50,658), SOR \n1.b ($20,627), SOR 1.c ($15,534), and SOR 1.f ($276) as being in collection. (Item 4) The \nreport also lists the debts in SOR 1.d ($13,451) and SOR 1.e ($4,712) as being charged off \nby the creditor. Applicant\u2019s June 2018 credit report lists the debts in SOR 1.b ($20,627), \nSOR 1.c ($15,534), and in SOR 1.d ($13,451) as being charged off by the creditor. (Item 5) \n \n\n4 \n \n \nApplicant indicated in his January 2018 interview, his financial delinquencies \nresulted from his diagnosis and treatment for cancer twice. (Item 3) He did not list this as a \nreason for his financial problems when he completed his e-QIP. He asserted, even though \nhe had health insurance, all of his treatment was not covered by his insurance. His income \nas a pastor was insufficient to pay his medical bills. Additionally, his wife was not allowed to \nwork while in Canada.  \n \n \nApplicant indicated the credit card accounts listed in SOR 1.b, SOR 1.d, SOR 1.e, \nand SOR 1.f were used to pay medical bills. There is no indication in the record as to when \nhe was diagnosed or treated for cancer or the cost of treatment. The delinquent obligation \nlisted in SOR 1.a ($50,658) was a student loan he took out for his son\u2019s education. The \ndelinquent obligation listed in SOR 1.c ($15,534) was a department store account he used \nto buy appliances and clothing. As of the date of his personal statement, January 2018, he \nhad not received financial counseling. During the interview, he did not indicate an intent to \npay any of the delinquent obligations.  \n \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion the Executive \nBranch has in regulating access to information pertaining to national security, emphasizing \nthat \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, \nthe administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be considered in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. These guidelines \nare not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, \nthese guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative \nprocess. The administrative judge\u2019s overall adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative \njudge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, \nfavorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence \nto establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant \nis responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \n\n5 \n \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation about potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7 of EO 10865 \nprovides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section \n3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information). \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \n \n \nThe security concerns about financial considerations are set forth in AG \u00b6 18: \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness \nto abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or \nsensitive information. Financial distress can also be caused or exacerbated \nby, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other issues of personnel security \nconcern such as excessive gambling, mental health conditions, substance \nmisuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. Affluence that cannot be explained by \nknown sources of income is also a security concern insofar as it may result \nfrom criminal activity, including espionage. \n \n \nApplicant is not required to be debt free, but he is require to manage his finances in \na way as to exhibit sound judgment and responsibility. The concern under Guideline F is \nbroader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly compromise classified \ninformation in order to raise money to address debts. It encompasses concerns about an \nindividual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. \n \n \nGuideline F security concerns are established by Applicant\u2019s delinquent obligations \nof more than $105,000. Disqualifying conditions AG \u00b6\u00b6 19 (a), \u201cinability to satisfy debts, \n19(b), \u201cunwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so,\u201d and 19(c), \u201ca history \nof not meeting financial obligations,\u201d primarily apply. During his subject interview, Applicant \nfailed to indicate he would make payment on these obligations.  \n \n \nFinancial delinquencies are potentially mitigated under one or more of the following \nconditions under AG \u00b6 20: \n \n\n6 \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under \nsuch circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem from a \nlegitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit counseling service, \nand there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under \ncontrol; \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \n \n  \nAG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply because there are numerous unpaid obligations. \nApplicant\u2019s failure to take any steps to repay the department store debt, the student loan \ndebt, and other credit card accounts continues to cast doubts on his judgment and \nreliability.  \n \n \nConcerning AG \u00b6 20(b), some of Applicant\u2019s delinquent obligations were apparently \nincurred due to him being treated twice for cancer. Medical treatment is a factor largely \nbeyond a person\u2019s control. However, Applicant provided no information on when the \ntreatment was received, the cost of the treatment, documentation as to the treatment and \ncost, and what efforts he made to address the medical costs. There is no indication that he \ncommunicated with his creditors or attempted to repay any of the past-due debts. Even the \n$276 medical debt (SOR 1.f) remains unpaid. For AG \u00b6 20(b) to fully apply, he must have \nacted responsibly under the circumstances, and there is no evidence he has done so.  \n \n \nNeither AG \u00b6 20(c) nor AG \u00b6 20(d) is established without some effort on his part to \naddress the debts. A creditor charge-off is an account transfer made when a creditor no \nlonger expects to be repaid. Debts remain legally enforceable even after they are charged \noff. There is no evidence of financial counseling or evidence of him having made any \npayments on the delinquent obligations in the SOR.  \n \n \n\n7 \n \n \nAppeal Board precedent requires that \u201ca person acts in such a way that shows \nreasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.\u201d1 Concerns \npersist about his financial judgment. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nIn assessing the whole person, the administrative judge must consider the totality of \nan applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative \nprocess factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). The analysis under Guideline F is incorporated in my whole-\nperson analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were addressed under that guideline, but \nsome warrant additional comment. \n \n \nThe security clearance adjudication is not aimed at collecting an applicant\u2019s \npersonal debts. Rather, it involves an evaluation of an applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness in light of the security guidelines in the Directive. See ISCR Case No. 09-\n02160 (App. Bd. Jun. 21, 2010). At the same time, Applicant has the burden of presenting \nevidence of relevant facts and circumstances to show why he should be granted security \nclearance eligibility notwithstanding the delinquent debt information on his credit record.  \n \n \nIn January 2018, Applicant was first questioned about his delinquent obligations \nduring his PSI. In April 2018, the SOR put him on notice of the Government\u2019s concern over \nhis past-due debts. In June 2018, the FORM restated the Government on-going concern \nabout his finances. Even though he was put on notice of the concern, he failed to \ndocument any payment of his past-due debts.  \n \n \nThe Appeal Board has repeatedly held that the government need not wait until an \napplicant mishandles or fails to safeguard classified information before denying or revoking \nsecurity clearance eligibility. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 08-09918 (App. Bd. Oct. 29, 2009, \nciting Adams v. Laird, 420 F.2d 230, 238-239 (D.C. Cir. 1969)). It is well settled that once a \nconcern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility, there is a strong \npresumption against the grant or renewal of a security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, \n913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th Cir. 1990). Based on the evidence before me, I am unable to \nconclude that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant security clearance \neligibility for Applicant. \n \n \n                                                 \n1 The DOHA Appeal Board stated in ISCR Case No. 07-06482, decided on May 21, 2008, in part: \n \nIn evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the concept of \n\u201c\u2018meaningful track record\u2019 necessarily includes evidence of actual debt reduction through \npayment of debts.\u201d See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 05-01920 at 5 (App. Bd. Mar. 1, 2007). \nHowever, an applicant is not required, as a matter of law, to establish that he has paid off \neach and every debt listed in the SOR. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 02-25499 at 2 (App. Bd. \nJun. 5, 2006). All that is required is that an applicant demonstrate[s] that he has \u201c. . . \nestablished a plan to resolve his financial problems and taken significant actions to \nimplement that plan.\u201d See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 04-09684 at 2 (App. Bd. Jul. 6, 2006). \n \n\n8 \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Financial Considerations:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.f: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to \nclassified information is denied. \n \n \n_____________________ \nClaude R. Heiny \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Applicant failed to mitigate security concerns related \nto his unresolved delinquent debts. Clearance is denied.  \nStatement of the Case \nOn April 30, 2018, the DOD issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing \nsecurity concerns under the financial considerations guideline.1 DOD adjudicators were \nunable to find that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s \nsecurity clearance. \nApplicant answered the SOR and requested a decision without a hearing.2 The \nGovernment submitted its written case on June 4, 2018. A complete copy of the file of \n1 The DOD CAF acted under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry, signed by President Eisenhower on February 20, 1960, as amended; as well as DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program, dated January 2, 1992, as \namended (Directive), and the Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified \nInformation, implemented on June 8, 2017.   \n2 GE 2. \n01/29/2019\n\n \n2 \n \nrelevant material (FORM) and the Directive were provided to Applicant. He received the \nFORM on June 7, 2018, and did not respond. The case was initially assigned to me in \nJuly 2018. However, the FORM contained a material clerical error that required \ncorrection. The Government served Applicant with an amended FORM on October 1, \n2018. Applicant timely submitted a response. The attachments to the amended FORM \nare admitted to the record as Government\u2019s Exhibits (GE) 1 through 4, and Applicant\u2019s \nresponse to the amended FORM is admitted as Applicant\u2019s Exhibit (AE) A, without \nobjection.   \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant, 64, has worked for his current employer, a federal contactor, since \nAugust 2015. He previously held a security clearance during his military service from \n1975 to 1980. He completed his most recent security clearance application in August \n2017. He affirmatively answered the question about delinquencies regarding routine \naccounts, but did not provide any details about specific accounts. The ensuing \ninvestigation revealed that he is indebted to five creditors for approximately $13,332. \nThe debts are alleged in the SOR and he admits the allegations.3  \n \n \nApplicant claims that his financial problems began when his 17-year marriage \ndissolved in 2000. He claims that he and his ex-wife accumulated debt during the \nmarriage and that she did not pay her share of the debt. Applicant continued to pay the \njoint debts for an unspecified amount of time, but stopped paying at an unspecified date. \nHe claims that his financial situation worsened in 2011, when he left the job he held for \n10 years to become the full-time caregiver for his ailing mother until her death. During \nhis four years out of the workforce, Applicant claims that he depleted his savings. He \nalso claims that he had a hard time re-entering the work, which he attributes to his age. \nHe accepted his current position, but at a lower rate of pay than his previous \nemployment.4  \n \n \nThe alleged debts remain unresolved. The record does not contain information \nabout Applicant\u2019s current finances.  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not \ninflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, \nadministrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction with the factors listed in the \nadjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, \nimpartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a \nconscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d \nThe administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the \nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n                                                          \n3 GE 3 \u2013 4. \n \n4 GE 2-4; AE A \n\n \n3 \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence. \n  \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nFinancial Considerations \n \nUnresolved delinquent debt is a serious security concern because failure to \n\u201csatisfy debts [or] meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of \njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified \ninformation.\u201d5  \n \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant owes over $13,000 in unresolved delinquent \ndebts. Applicant\u2019s admissions and the credit reports in the record support the \nGovernment\u2019s prima facie case that Applicant has a history of not meeting his financial \nobligations and an inability to repay his creditors when he was unemployed between \n2011 and 2015.6   \n \nApplicant failed to mitigate the financial concerns raised by his delinquent \naccounts. While Applicant\u2019s financial problems may have been caused by events \nbeyond his control: his divorce in the early 2000s; his four years\u2019 of unemployment as \nhe cared for his ailing mother; and, his difficulty re-entering the workforce, he has not \nprovided sufficient information to show that he has acted responsibly in light of his \ncircumstances. Because there is no current financial information in the record, it is \nunclear if the debts remain unpaid because Applicant has an inability or unwillingness to \nresolve them. Ultimately, Applicant provided no evidence that he has made a good-faith \neffort to repay his creditors, that he has a legitimate basis for disputing the alleged \naccounts, or that his financial problems are under control.  \n                                                          \n5  AG \u00b6 18. \n \n6 AG \u00b6 19(a) and (c). \n \n\n \n4 \n \nBased on the record, doubts remain about Applicant\u2019s suitability for access to \nclassified information. In reaching this conclusion, I have also considered the whole-\nperson factors at AG \u00b6 2(d). Applicant failed to meet his burdens of production and \npersuasion to refute or mitigate the financial and personal conduct concerns raised in \nthe SOR. Accordingly, following Egan7 and the clearly-consistent standard, I resolve \nthese doubts in favor of protecting national security.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Financial Considerations:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.e:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nBased on the record, it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant \nApplicant eligibility for a security clearance.

Applicant was \nintoxicated. There was a designated driver, but this person decided to take the vehicle \nhe was driving onto private beach property. Applicant stated he woke up and was being \npulled out of the vehicle. He spent the night in jail, and the owner of the property \ndecided not to press charges, so they were dismissed.4 \n \n \nApplicant testified that the night of December 31, 2008, he was home and his \ncousin called him from a bar. Applicant went to the bar and consumed some alcohol. He \nwas driving his cousin home and was stopped by the police. He testified that his \nbreathalyzer result was .09%. He was arrested and charged with driving while \nintoxicated. After he completed the requirements of a pretrial diversion program, which \nincluded a defensive driving course, a 5-day alcohol awareness course, and 100 hours \nof community service, the charge was dismissed.5  \n                                                          \n1 Tr. 16-18. \n \n2 Tr. 20; GE 4. \n \n3 Tr. 20-23; GE 4. \n \n4 Tr. 24-26; GE 4. \n \n5 Tr. 26-27, 34-35; GE 4. \n\n \n3 \n \n \n \nIn 2017, Applicant was attending a coworker\u2019s birthday party. He had taken a \nride-share vehicle to the party. He consumed too much alcohol, became intoxicated, \nand blacked out. He testified he had no recollection of the night. He and his girlfriend \nhad separate rooms, but had permitted each access to the other\u2019s. Applicant went into \nhis girlfriend\u2019s hotel room to return a gift and then went back to his room. She returned \nlater and was also intoxicated. She could not find an item in her room and began \nbanging on Applicant\u2019s hotel room door, which he did not answer because he was \npassed out. The hotel staff called the police. The police attempted to wake Applicant \nand gain access to his room. He did not answer due to his intoxication. Once he woke, \nhe was arrested and charged with 2nd degree burglary, theft and criminal damage per \ndomestic violence. Applicant attended court two days later and the charges were \ndismissed. Applicant\u2019s former girlfriend provided a letter corroborating the events and \nexplained the hotel staff misunderstood the situation, and there was no crime \ncommitted. She regretted how the event transpired and escalated. Applicant reported \nthe November 2017 incident to his employer immediately after he was released from \njail.6   \n \n \nApplicant testified that he consumes alcohol about one to three times a month. \nThe last time he was intoxicated was in November 2017 when the incident happened at \nthe hotel. He has not had an alcohol evaluation. He stated that he has only been to a \nbar once since the 2017 incident and that was for his friend\u2019s birthday, and Applicant \nwas the designated driver. Otherwise, he no longer goes to bars and when he drinks it \nis at home. He does not believe he has a problem with alcohol. He has made a decision \nthat he will not consume alcohol in public places, such as bars and restaurants. He has \nlearned his lesson. He stated he has a huge opportunity to further his career with his \nemployer and does not want to jeopardize it. He promised that in the future, he will not \ndrink alcohol to intoxication.7  \n \n \nApplicant is remorseful and embarrassed, and regrets his past mistakes. He \naccepts responsibility for his past conduct and is committed to acting responsibly in the \nfuture.  \n \n \nApplicant provided character letters from coworkers and friends who describe \nhim as a dedicated professional who is always at the work site on time; is focused on \nattention to details, and consistently adheres to security requirements. He is considered \nreliable, \ndiligent, \nhonest, \ngenerous, \nintelligent, \nethical, \nfriendly, \nconsiderate, \nhardworking, and trustworthy.8  \n \n \n \n \n                                                          \n6 Tr. 29-30, 35-36; GE 3; AE A. \n \n7 Tr. 30-33; 37-44. \n \n8 AE B. \n\n \n4 \n \n \nPolicies \n  \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have not drawn inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline J: Criminal Conduct \n \nThe security concern for criminal conduct is set out in AG & 30: \n \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability \nor willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations.  \n \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. I have \nconsidered all of the disqualifying conditions under AG & 31, and the following are \npotentially applicable: \n \n(a) a pattern of minor offenses, any one of which on its own would be \nunlikely to affect a national security eligibility decision, but which in \ncombination cast doubt on the individual\u2019s judgment, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness; and \n \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted. \n \n \nApplicant was arrested for criminal offenses six times from 2000 to 2017, and \nhas three convictions. The offenses included assault, possession of marijuana, public \nintoxication and trespassing, driving while intoxicated, burglary, theft and criminal \ndamage. The above disqualifying conditions apply. \n \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns \narising from criminal conduct. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 32 are \npotentially applicable: \n \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment; and \n \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited \nto, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \n \n \nApplicant was involved in a series of minor criminal offenses from 2000 to 2006. \nThose offenses alone would not justify denial of a security clearance. However, \nApplicant was arrested and charged in 2009 for driving while intoxicated. He \n\n \n6 \n \n \nsuccessfully completed a pretrial diversion program. It appears he was not involved in \nany new criminal conduct until 2017, when he was arrested after an incident at a hotel. \nThis charge was dismissed and there is sufficient evidence to conclude it was a \nmisunderstanding. The last three incidents involved alcohol, which is a concern. \nApplicant immediately reported the 2017 incident to his employer, which shows he \nrecognized the potential security implications. He understands the negative impact his \ncriminal offenses and alcohol have had on his life and career. He credibility testified that \nhe is committed to ensuring alcohol does not have an impact on his life in the future. It \nappears from character letters from friends and coworkers that Applicant is dedicated to \nhis job. He has not been intoxicated since the event of November 2017 and has only \nbeen to a bar once for a birthday party, and he was the designated driver. Applicant \nexpressed sincere remorse for his conduct and I believe he has a new appreciation for \nthe devastating impact a future criminal or alcohol-related incident will have on his life \nand career. I find that future criminal conduct is unlikely to recur. Based on Applicant\u2019s \ngood employment record as expressed through his coworkers and his commitment to \nthe responsible consumption of alcohol, there is sufficient evidence to conclude that \nthere is successful rehabilitation. AG \u00b6\u00b6 32(a) and 32(d) apply. \n \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern for personal conduct:  \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. The following will \nnormally result in an unfavorable national security eligibility determination, \nsecurity clearance action, or cancellation of further processing for national \nsecurity eligibility:  \n \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. I find the following potentially applicable:  \n \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress by a \nforeign intelligence entity or other individual or group. Such conduct \nincludes: (1) engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the \nperson\u2019s personal, professional, or community standing.  \n \nApplicant was arrested and charged with criminal offenses six times from 2000 to \n2017 and has three convictions. The offenses included assault, possession of \nmarijuana, public intoxication and trespassing, driving while intoxicated, and burglary, \ntheft and criminal damage. The above disqualifying condition applies. \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 17 are potentially applicable to the \ndisqualifying security concerns based on the facts: \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely \nto recur; \n \nThe same conduct that was alleged under the criminal conduct guideline was \ncross-alleged under the personal conduct guideline. The same rationale and analysis \ndetailed above under the criminal conduct mitigating conditions apply under the \npersonal conduct mitigating conditions. The above mitigating conditions apply.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guidelines J and E in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(a) \nwere addressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional comment.  \n \nApplicant is 37 years old. As a young man he made some minor mistakes that \nresulted in criminal arrests. He was charged with driving while intoxicated in 2009 and \n\n \n8 \n \n \nsuccessfully completed a pretrial diversion program. Although there was an incident in \n2017, it was dismissed and appeared to be a misunderstanding. I considered \nApplicant\u2019s demeanor, candor, and remorsefulness. Applicant understands and \nacknowledges that alcohol has had a negative impact on his life. He is committed to it \nnot having an impact on his future. He understands he has a career opportunity and any \nfuture negative conduct could deny him that chance. I believe he will comply with his \npromises. Overall, the record evidence leaves me with no questions or doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. Applicant has mitigated the \ncriminal conduct and personal conduct security concerns.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline J:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.f: \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant a security clearance. \nEligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nCarol G.

Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application on April 26, 2017. On May 1, \n2018, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility (DOD CAF) sent \nher a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging security concerns under Guideline F. The \nDOD CAF acted under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, \nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated in Security \nExecutive Agent Directive 4, National Security Adjudicative Guidelines (December 10, \n2016), for all adjudicative decisions on or after June 8, 2017. \nApplicant answered the SOR on May 30, 2018, and requested a hearing before \nan administrative judge. Department Counsel was ready to proceed on August 1, 2018, \n01/04/2019\n\n \n2 \n \nand the case was assigned to me on September 11, 2018. On September 20, 2018, the \nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) notified Applicant that the hearing was \nscheduled for October 29, 2018. I convened the hearing as scheduled. Government \nExhibits (GX) 1 through 5 were admitted in evidence without objection. Applicant \ntestified but did not present the testimony of any other witnesses or documentary \nevidence. I kept the record open until November 16, 2018, to enable her to submit \ndocumentary evidence. She did not submit any further evidence. DOHA received the \ntranscript (Tr.) on November 6, 2018. \n \nFindings of Fact1 \n \n \nApplicant is a 44-year-old program analyst employed by a defense contractor \nsince January 2017. She worked as a site manager from January 2005 to January \n2013, earning about $82,000 per year. She was laid off and unemployed from January \n2013 to April 2013. (GX 2 at 3.) She worked as an office assistant in a salvage yard \nfrom March to June 2014, earning about $10 per hour. She moved from another state to \nher current state of domicile in June 2014. She worked as a data analyst from June \n2014 to December 2015, earning about $72,000 per year. She worked as a program \nmanager for a federal contractor from December 2015 to May 2016, earning about \n$82,000 per year, and she was laid off when this employer\u2019s contracted ended. She was \nunemployed from June 2016 to January 2017, when she began her current \nemployment. Her beginning salary with her current employer was $52,000, she received \na raise to $55,000 per year about a month before the hearing. (Tr. 28-37.) She was \ncleared for a public trust position by another government agency in July 2014. \n \n \nApplicant was enrolled in an online university from April 2007 to January 2012. \nShe received an associate\u2019s degree in April 2008 and a bachelor\u2019s degree in business \nmanagement in January 2012. She has about $175,000 in student loans, which are \ndeferred and not alleged in the SOR. (Tr. 61-62.) \n \nApplicant has never married. She has three children, ages 22, 20, and 15. She \ntestified that she was entitled to child support for her two older children, but that their \nfather was about $50,000 in arrears, and she has been unable to collect it. She was \nuncertain whether a court order requiring payment of the arrearage is still in effect. (Tr. \n59-60.) \n \n \nThe SOR alleges 22 delinquent debts totaling more than $57,000. The debts are \nreflected in credit reports from July 2017 and April 2018, and in court records submitted \nby Department Counsel. In Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, she admitted all the \nallegations. Her admissions in her answer and at the hearing are incorporated in my \nfindings of fact. The evidence concerning the debts alleged in the SOR is summarized \nbelow. \n \n                                                          \n1 Applicant\u2019s personal information is extracted from her security clearance application (GX 1) unless \notherwise indicated by a parenthetical citation to the record. \n\n \n3 \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.a: unpaid rent placed for collection of $18,469. Applicant testified \nthat part of this debt was reduced to judgment, alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.l, that the judgment \nwas satisfied by garnishment, that she has a payment agreement for $370 per month on \nthe remainder of the debt, and that the balance has been reduced to about $6,000. She \nsubmitted no documentary evidence to support her testimony. (Tr. 39-40.) The April \n2018 credit report reflects that the creditor for this debt is the same as the plaintiff in the \njudgment alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.l. The credit report reflects that this collection account is \nfor attorney\u2019s fees and \u201coutstanding balance.\u201d \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.b: car loan charged off for $12,785. Applicant voluntarily surrendered \nher car when she was unable to make the payments. She testified that she contacted \nthe creditor, who offered to settle the debt for about $8,000, which she could not afford. \nThe debt is not resolved. (Tr. 41.) \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.c: telecommunications debt placed for collection of $1,181. \nApplicant testified that this debt is for unreturned equipment and that she has disputed \nthe debt and sent the creditor a copy of her receipt for the returned equipment. (Tr. 42.) \nShe did not provide a copy of her receipt for the returned equipment or any other \ndocumentation of her dispute. \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.d: credit card charged off for $589. Applicant testified that she does \nnot have a payment plan for this debt, but that she sent two payments to the creditor, \none for $137 and one for $50. She testified that she had documentation of her \npayments, but she did not submit anything to support her testimony. (Tr. 43.) \n \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e, 1.f, 1.i, and 1.j: four collection accounts from same creditor, \ntwo for $236 and two for $118. Applicant admitted these debts in her answer to the \nSOR, but at the hearing she testified that she was unable to identify them. (Tr. 44.) She \ntestified that she disputed the debts online with the named creditor but did not receive a \nresponse. She did not submit any documentation of her dispute. (Tr. 65-66.) \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.g: satellite television placed for collection of $178. Applicant has \ntaken no action to resolve this debt. (Tr. 45.) \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.h: collection account for $150. Applicant testified that this debt was \nan application fee for a rental property, but that she did not move into the property. She \ntestified that she intended to pay the debt in full by the end of October 2018. (Tr. 46.) \nShe has submitted no evidence of a payment. \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.k: utility bill placed for collection of $114. Applicant testified that she \nscheduled a payment on this debt but could not afford to make it. (Tr. 47-48.) The debt \nis not resolved. \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.l: judgment for unpaid rent, filed in January 2015 for $3,566. \nApplicant testified that this judgment was for part of the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a. \n\n \n4 \n \nCourt records reflect that she was evicted. (GX 5 at 1.) She testified that the judgment \nwas satisfied, but she submitted no documentation to support her testimony. (Tr. 48.) \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.m: judgment for unpaid rent, filed in November 2015 for $4,450. \nCourt records reflect that Applicant was evicted. (GX 5 at 2.) Applicant admitted that the \njudgment is unsatisfied. (Tr. 51.)  \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.n: judgment for unpaid rent, filed in January 2017 for $9,110. \nApplicant testified that she withheld the rent for an apartment because the landlord was \nunwilling to make necessary repairs. The court agreed with the landlord and Applicant \nwas evicted. (GX 5 at 3.) She has not contacted the creditor or taken any action to \nresolve this debt. (Tr. 51-52.) \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.o: cable bill referred for collection of $643. Applicant has not \ncontacted the creditor or attempted to resolve this debt. (Tr. 52-53.) \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.p: cellphone bill placed for collection of $2,133. Applicant has not \ncontacted the creditor or attempted to resolve the debt. (Tr. 54.) \n \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.q, 1.r, 1.s, 1.t, and 1.u: medical bills placed for collection of $831, \n$234, $836, $297, and $386. Applicant testified that these medical bills were for her \nson, who has severe asthma. She testified that she was contacted by a collection agent \n(but not the collection agents alleged in the SOR) regarding three medical bills, that she \nmade a payment agreement for a total of $549, and that the debts would be resolved \nafter she makes two more payments. (Tr. 54-58.) She did not provide documentation of \npayment agreements or payments. \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.v: telecommunications bill placed for collection of $469. Applicant \ntestified that she contacted the creditor about a payment agreement, but the creditor \ninsisted on payment in full. (Tr. 58.) The debt is not resolved. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s annual salary equates to gross pay of about $4,580 per month. She \nprovided no information about her about her take-home pay. Her monthly living \nexpenses total about $1,312 (Tr. 60-61.) She has no savings or retirement accounts. \nShe has never received financial counseling. (Tr. 64.)  \n \nPolicies \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2.  \n \n\n \n5 \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. \n10865 \u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the \napplicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense \nhave established for issuing a clearance. \n \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in \nthe personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant \nfrom being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden \nof establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-\n01253 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr.20, 2016).   \n \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \n \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. \n01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, \nif they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n \n\n \n6 \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18:  \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is \nfinancially overextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or \notherwise questionable acts to generate funds. . . . \n \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See \nISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \n \n \nThe documentary evidence reflects that the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.l \nare the same debt. When the same conduct is alleged twice in the SOR under the same \nguideline, one of the duplicative allegations should be resolved in Applicant=s favor. See \nISCR Case No. 03-04704 at 3 (App. Bd. Sep. 21, 2005) (same debt alleged twice). \nAccordingly, I will resolve SOR \u00b6 1.l in Applicant\u2019s favor.  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the documentary evidence submitted at the hearing \nestablish the following disqualifying conditions: AG \u00b6 19(a) \u201cinability to satisfy debts\u201d); \nAG \u00b6 19(b) \u201cunwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so\u201d); and AG \u00b6 \n19(c) (\u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d). \n \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable:  \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were \nlargely beyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n\n \n7 \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c): the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling \nfor the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \ncredit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem \nis being resolved or is under control; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \nAG \u00b6 20(e): the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy \nof the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a) is not established. Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts are numerous, recent, \nand were not incurred under circumstances making them unlikely to recur. \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b) is not fully established. Applicant\u2019s unemployment from January to \nApril 2013 and June 2016 to January 2017, and her drastic pay reduction from $82,000 \nper year in May 2016 to $52,000 per year in January 2017 were conditions largely \nbeyond her control. She testified about responsible efforts to resolve her delinquent \ndebts, but she submitted no documentary evidence to support her testimony. When \napplicants claim to have taken actions to resolve delinquent debts, they are expected to \npresent documentary evidence supporting their claims. See ISCR Case No. 15-03363 \nat 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 19, 2016). \n \n \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 20(c) and 20(d) are not established. Applicant presented no documentary \nevidence of financial counseling, payment agreements, or payments on her delinquent \ndebts. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(e) is not established. Applicant claimed that she disputed the \ntelecommunications debt in SOR \u00b6 1.c, but she submitted no documentation of the \ndispute or the basis for it. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances and applying the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d).2  \n                                                          \n2 The factors are: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances \nsurrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the \nconduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral \n\n \n8 \n \n \n \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person \nanalysis and applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). After weighing the \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline F and evaluating all the \nevidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the \nsecurity concerns raised by her delinquent debts. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): AGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.k: \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.l:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.m-1.v: \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.

Applicant\u2019s \neligibility for a security clearance is granted. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn April 30, 2018, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications \nFacility (DOD CAF) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security \nconcerns under Guideline B. The DOD CAF acted under Executive Order 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nadjudicative guidelines (AG), effective June 8, 2017 (AG).  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on June 24, 2018, and elected to have his case \ndecided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. Department Counsel submitted the \nGovernment\u2019s File of Relevant Material (FORM) on August 7, 2018. The evidence \n12/07/2018\n\n \n2 \n \n \nincluded in the FORM is identified as Items 3-5 (Items 1 and 2 include pleadings and \ntransmittal information). The FORM was mailed to Applicant, who received it on \nSeptember 15, 2018. Applicant was given an opportunity to file objections and submit \nmaterial in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation. Applicant did not file objections, but \nsubmitted exhibit (AE) A, which is admitted without objection. Items 3-5 are also \nadmitted into evidence without objection. The case was assigned to me on November 2, \n2018. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he admitted all the SOR allegations with \nexplanations. The admissions are incorporated into the findings of fact. After a thorough \nand careful review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following \nadditional findings of fact. \n \nThe SOR alleged Applicant\u2019s mother and three brothers are citizens and \nresidents of Iraq. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.d).  \n \n \nApplicant is 47 years old. He was born in Iraq in 1970. He served in mandatory \nconscripted military and Ba\u2019ath party service from 1988-1993. He moved to Dubai, \nUnited Arab Emirates, in 2005 and resided there until 2007, when he moved back to \nIraq. He worked as a translator with U.S. forces in Iraq from 2007-2009. Because of his \nwork with U.S. forces, he qualified for a special immigrant visa. He used that visa to \nimmigrate to the United States in 2009. He was awarded an associate\u2019s degree from a \nU.S. community college in 2014. He became a U.S. citizen in March 2015. He is \nseeking a clearance for a translator position with a federal contractor. He is currently \nworking for the contractor and deployed to Iraq. He is single with no children.1   \n \nForeign Influence. \n \n \n \nApplicant has the following relatives who are residents and citizens of Iraq:  \n \n \n1. His mother. His mother is 70 years and is a housewife. She is not affiliated \nwith the government or the military. Applicant has weekly telephone contact with her. \nShe is unaware of his work position and he has not visited her since moving to the \nUnited States in 2009.2  \n \n \n2. Applicant\u2019s three brothers. His three brothers are younger. None of his \nbrothers know what he does for a living or where he works. None of his brothers have \nany Iraqi government connections. Applicant\u2019s telephone contact with his brothers \nranges from quarterly to annually.3 \n                                                          \n1 Items 3-5. \n \n2 Item 4; AE A. \n \n3 Item 4; AE A. \n\n \n3 \n \n \nIraq. \n \n \nThe U.S. State Department warns U.S. citizens against travel to Iraq as travel \nwithin the country remains dangerous. The U.S. Embassy warns that U.S. citizens are at \nhigh risk for kidnapping and violence and to avoid all but essential travel to Iraq. The \nU.S. government considers the potential threat to U.S. government personnel in Iraq to \nbe serious enough to require them to live and work under strict security guidelines. The \nIslamic State of Iraq and Levant (ISIL) remained the greatest terrorist threat globally, \nmaintaining a formidable force in Iraq and Syria.4 \n \nCharacter Evidence. \n \n \nApplicant supplied character references from his last two commanders for whom \nhe conducted translator duties at various times during 2018. His commanders found \nApplicant to be professional and completely devoted to the U.S. Army and his country. \nHe was described as creating \u201cenhanced situational awareness on the battlefield, \ncontributing significantly to the defeat of the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS).\u201d \nAdditionally, they describe him as an outstanding asset whom they trust. They \nrecommend granting his clearance.5   \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(a), the entire process is a careful weighing of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \n \n                                                          \n4 The Government failed to provide information concerning the country of Iraq for the purpose of taking \nadministrative notice. I take administrative notice of the stated information from the U.S. Department of \nState website (https://iq.usembassy.gov/iraq-travel-warning-january-31-2017/). See FRE 201 and ISCR \nCase No. 05-11292 at 4 n.1 (App. Bd. Apr. 12, 2007); ISCR Case No. 02-24875 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, \n2006) (citing ISCR Case No. 02-18668 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 10, 2004) and McLeod v. Immigration and \nNaturalization Service, 802 F.2d 89, 93 n.4 (3d Cir. 1986). \n \n5 Item 2. \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \n \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for foreign influence is set out in AG \n\u00b6 7: \n \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they \nresult in divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern \nif they create circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to \npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign \ncontacts and interests should consider the country in which the foreign \ncontact or interest is located, including, but not limited to, considerations \nsuch as whether it is known to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or \nsensitive information or is associated with a risk of terrorism. \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \nAG \u00b6 7 indicates conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the \nindividual's desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing \nthat information or technology.  \n \nThe nature of a nation\u2019s government, its relationship with the United States, and \nits human rights record are relevant in assessing the likelihood that an Applicant\u2019s family \nmembers are vulnerable to government coercion or inducement. The risk of coercion, \npersuasion, or duress is significantly greater if the foreign country has an authoritarian \ngovernment, a family member or friend is associated with or dependent upon the \ngovernment, the country is known to conduct intelligence collection operations against \nthe United States, or the foreign country is associated with a risk of terrorism. The \nrelationship between Iraq and the United States places a significant, but not \ninsurmountable burden of persuasion on Applicant to demonstrate that his relationships \nwith his relatives living in Iraq does not pose a security risk. Applicant should not be \nplaced in a position where he might be forced to choose between loyalty to the United \nStates and a desire to assist his relatives living in Iraq who might be coerced by \ngovernmental entities, or pressured to assist Iraq.  \n \nGuideline B is not limited to countries hostile to the United States. \u201cThe United \nStates has a compelling interest in protecting and safeguarding classified information \nfrom any person, organization, or country that is not authorized to have access to it, \nregardless of whether that person, organization, or country has interests inimical to \nthose of the United States.\u201d6 Furthermore, friendly nations can have profound \ndisagreements with the United States over matters they view as important to their vital \ninterests or national security. Finally, we know friendly nations have engaged in \nespionage against the United States, especially in the economic, scientific, and \ntechnical fields.  \n \nWhile there is no evidence that intelligence operatives from Iraq seek or have \nsought classified or economic information from or through Applicant or his relatives \nliving in Iraq, it is not possible to rule out such a possibility in the future. AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a) and \n7(b) apply based upon Applicant\u2019s family members who are residents and citizens of \nIraq.  \n \n                                                          \n6 ISCR Case No. 02-11570 at 5 (App. Bd. May 19, 2004). \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \nAG \u00b6 8 lists conditions that could mitigate foreign influence security concerns, \nincluding:  \n \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nU.S.;  \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual's sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest; and  \n \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation. \n \nAG \u00b6 8(a) does not apply. Applicant\u2019s current translator position could cause him \nto be placed in a position to choose between the interests of his relatives and those of \nthe United States. Applicant credibly testified that he has limited contact with his \nrelatives in Iraq. AG \u00b6 8(c) partially applies. \n \nApplicant has met his burden to establish his \u201cdeep and longstanding \nrelationships and loyalties in the U.S.\u201d He worked as a translator from 2007 to 2009 for \nU.S. forces in Iraq. Additionally, as recently as this year, Applicant also worked as a \ntranslator for U.S. forces in Iraq where he earned praise for his loyalty, bravery, and \ntrustworthiness while serving in harm\u2019s way. He moved to the United States in 2009, \nearned an associates degree here, and became a U.S. citizen in 2015. The evidence \nsupports the conclusion that Applicant has longstanding ties to the United States and \nwould resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the United States. AG \u00b6 8(b) applies. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \n\n \n7 \n \n \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. The circumstances tending to \nsupport granting Applicant\u2019s clearance are more significant than the factors weighing \ntowards denying his clearance. I considered the recommendations of his two \ncommanders, who resoundingly recommend that Applicant be granted his security \nclearance. I also considered his strong ties to this country, as a translator serving in \nharm\u2019s way while assisting U.S. forces on two separate occasions. He has \ndemonstrated his longstanding loyalty to the United States. Therefore, he provided \nsufficient evidence to mitigate the security concerns.  \n \nOverall the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude that the security concerns arising under Guideline B, foreign influence \nconcerns were mitigated.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.d:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of same, I make the following additional findings of fact: Applicant is a 39-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been serving as a director of field applications with his employer since September 2016. He was previously an owner of a construction corporation from August 2012 until December 2015. A 1997 high school graduate, Applicant received a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2001 and a master\u2019s degree in 2009. He has never served with the U.S. military. He never held a security clearance. He was married in 2004. He has two sons, born in 2007 and 2012. 3 Financial Considerations1 There was nothing unusual about Applicant\u2019s finances until 2014. Applicant\u2019s company merged with another company in late 2012, and he became the co-owner and operator of a small real estate development firm organized as an S corporation. Together with two partners, they shared equally in the income, liabilities, and management of the corporation. The company was doing rather well financially, and in early 2014, it had eight residential and commercial properties in various stages of construction. There were approximately $1,000,000 in outstan",

On January 30, 2018, the Department of Defense (DOD) \nConsolidated Adjudications Facility (CAF) issued him a set of interrogatories. He \nresponded to those interrogatories on April 2, 2018. On May 4, 2018, the DOD CAF \nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to him, under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended and \nmodified; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance \nReview Program (January 2, 1992), as amended and modified (Directive); and Directive \n4 of the Security Executive Agent (SEAD 4) National Security Adjudicative Guidelines \n(AG) (December 10, 2016), for all covered individuals who require initial or continued \n12/20/2018\n\n  \n  \n2  \n                                        \neligibility for access to classified information or eligibility to hold a sensitive position, \neffective June 8, 2017. \n \nThe SOR alleged security concerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations), \nand detailed reasons why the DOD adjudicators were unable to find that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. \nThe SOR recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a \nclearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.  \n \n \nApplicant received the SOR on May 16, 2018. In two separate sworn statements, \ndated May 23, 2018, and June 27, 2018, Applicant responded to the SOR and requested \na hearing before an administrative judge. Department Counsel indicated the Government \nwas prepared to proceed on July 31, 2018. The case was assigned to me on August 24, \n2018.  A Notice of Hearing was issued on August 29, 2018. I convened the hearing as \nscheduled on September 26, 2018. \n \n \nDuring the hearing, Government exhibits (GE) 1 through GE 5, and Applicant \nexhibits (AE) A through AE I, were admitted into evidence without objection. Applicant \ntestified. The transcript (Tr.) was received on October 4, 2018. I kept the record open to \nenable Applicant to supplement it. He took advantage of that opportunity and timely \nsubmitted additional documents, which were marked and admitted as AE J through AE \nP, without objection. The record closed on November 8, 2018. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted with comments two of the three \nfactual allegations pertaining to financial considerations of the SOR (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. and \n1.b.). Applicant\u2019s admissions and comments are incorporated herein as findings of fact. \nAfter a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due \nconsideration of same, I make the following additional findings of fact:  \n \nApplicant is a 39-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been serving \nas a director of field applications with his employer since September 2016. He was \npreviously an owner of a construction corporation from August 2012 until December 2015. \nA 1997 high school graduate, Applicant received a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2001 and a \nmaster\u2019s degree in 2009. He has never served with the U.S. military. He never held a \nsecurity clearance. He was married in 2004. He has two sons, born in 2007 and 2012. \n \n \n \n\n  \n  \n3  \n                                        \nFinancial Considerations1 \n  \nThere was nothing unusual about Applicant\u2019s finances until 2014. Applicant\u2019s \ncompany merged with another company in late 2012, and he became the co-owner and \noperator of a small real estate development firm organized as an S corporation. Together \nwith two partners, they shared equally in the income, liabilities, and management of the \ncorporation. The company was doing rather well financially, and in early 2014, it had eight \nresidential and commercial properties in various stages of construction. There were \napproximately $1,000,000 in outstanding gross billings and approximately $175,000 in \noutstanding short-term liabilities associated primarily with labor and materials for those \njobs.2 In January 2014, Applicant\u2019s two partners unexpectedly decided to abandon the \nbusiness, leaving him with the liabilities. They were removed from the corporation.3 He \nlater determined that that they had improperly and secretly bid against the corporation \nunder a company name they had created, and had charged personal expenses and \nexpenses for their secret company to the corporate account, and had already delivered \n$25,000 to $35,000 in upgrades to customers without Applicant\u2019s knowledge.  \nApplicant focused on attempting to complete the construction jobs that were \nunfinished. Two of the families, with about 75 percent of the work on their respective \nhouses completed, and final inspections performed, stopped making payments. The \nunpaid balances totaled approximately $150,000. Applicant filed liens. He sued one \nfamily in arbitration for $93,000, but only received $13,000 after arbitration in August \n2015.4 Those funds went back to the corporation to pay off debts. He sued another \nhomeowner, and in December 2017, he received a judgment for $43,000, plus court \ncosts.5 He did not actually receive the funds until nearly a year later. Applicant worked \nthree jobs: building homes and as an information technology consultant, in order to \ngenerate the funds necessary to resolve the debts that resulted from his ex-partners\u2019 \nactions and the refusal of his customers to timely pay their bills. However, it was the \nactions of his bank in 2015 that resulted in the most lasting damage to his financial \nsituation. \nApplicant and one of his customers happened to use the same bank. His customer \nwrote him a check for approximately $54,500 one Friday afternoon in August 2015, and \nApplicant deposited it into his account. That evening, Applicant\u2019s account details reflected \n                                                          \n1 General source information pertaining to the financial issues discussed below can be found in the \nfollowing exhibits: GE 1 (e-QIP, dated April 11, 2017); GE 2 (Personal Subject Interview, dated July 19, \n2017); GE 3 (Combined Experian, TransUnion, and Equifax Credit Report, dated July 5, 2017); GE 4 \n(Equifax Credit Report, dated January 25, 2018); GE 5 (Applicant\u2019s Answers to Interrogatories, dated April \n2, 2018, along with associated papers, various dates); Applicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR, dated May 23, 2018; \nApplicant\u2019s Amended Answer to the SOR, dated June 27, 2018; AE I (Letter, dated September 17, 2018).   \n  \n2 AE B (Checking Account Transactions, dated May 23, 2014); AE I, supra note 1. \n \n3 AE A (Corporate Record, dated January 14, 2014). \n \n4 AE C (Arbitration Correspondence, various dates). \n \n5 AE C-1 (Final Judgment, dated December 27, 2017). \n\n  \n  \n4  \n                                        \nthat the funds were available. The following Tuesday, the funds were removed from the \naccount by the bank without Applicant\u2019s knowledge or authorization, eventually causing \nseveral of his checks to bounce. Applicant\u2019s efforts to have the funds restored were \nsuccessful, and the funds were put back into his account on Friday. Applicant\u2019s personal \nbanker at the bank and the branch manager even acknowledged that the re-deposit was \nmade with no holds on the deposit, and they explained that the issue developed because \nof internal bank processing difficulties. Unfortunately, during the week of the missing \nfunds, Applicant\u2019s laborers refused to show up for work because payments could not be \nguaranteed. For the third time, the bank again removed the funds from Applicant\u2019s \naccount without his knowledge or authorization, and once again Applicant had several \nmore checks bounce. The experience and the delays cost Applicant roughly four weeks \nof production on a commercial project, and his cash-flow was negatively impacted. In \nOctober 2015, Applicant requested a $20,000 credit line from that same bank so he could \nhave sufficient funds to complete two construction projects and have approximately \n$155,000 in receivables released to him, but the bank rejected his request.6 Although \nApplicant estimated that the bank measures cost him $200,000, and the bank denied any \nliability for its actions, the bank settled Applicant\u2019s claims, and it agreed to pay him \n$55,000 in September 2016.7  \nApplicant debated whether or not to sue his former partners for fraud, but based \non estimated legal costs of up to $30,000, he decided not to do so.8 Because of the impact \non his finances, Applicant was not in a position to make more timely payments to his two \ncreditors, but he did contact them in an effort to establish repayment plans or settlements. \nOn January 17, 2017, the first such repayment plan was agreed to, and Applicant started \nmaking monthly $500 payments. Payments were made as agreed, and in August 2018, \nthe account was satisfied. In May 2018, based on settlement offers, Applicant presented \nrepayment plans to his remaining creditor, the holder of two of his delinquent accounts.9  \nThe SOR identified three purportedly delinquent accounts that had been placed \nfor collection or charged-off, as generally reflected by Applicant\u2019s July 2017 or January \n2018 credit reports. Those debts total approximately $56,139. The current status of those \naccounts is as follows: \n(SOR \u00b6 1.a.): This is a bank loan with a high credit of $30,000 and an unpaid and \npast-due balance of $23,920, of which $22,638 was charged off in March 2016.10 \nApplicant reached out to the creditor and agreed to a settlement in the amount of $9,560. \nHe offered to start making monthly payments of $300 or more, but the bank wanted \n                                                          \n6 AE E (Letter, undated). \n \n7 AE E (Bank Litigation File, various dates). \n \n8 Tr. at 41. \n \n9 Applicant\u2019s Amended Answer to the SOR, supra note 1; AE F (Settlement Offer, undated); AE G \n(Settlement Offer, undated); AE I, supra note 1; AE H (Consent Judgment, dated January 17, 2017); AE H \n(Satisfaction of Judgment, dated August 21, 2018). \n \n10 GE 3, supra note 1, at 6; GE 4, supra note 1, at 2. \n\n  \n  \n5  \n                                        \nsomething like $800.11 In October 2018, Applicant sold some real estate for $195,000, \nwith an estimated net receipt of $177,975.12 He contacted the creditor the day before the \nsale, and expects to use funds from the sale to resolve the debt.13 There is no \ndocumentary evidence of any payments on the account since the sale. The account has \nnot been resolved. \n(SOR \u00b6 1.b.): This is a bank-issued credit card with a high credit of $22,638 and \nan unpaid and past-due balance of $20,219 that was charged off in June 2016.14 \nApplicant reached out to the creditor and agreed to a settlement in the amount of $8,088. \nHe offered to start making monthly payments of $250 or more, but the bank wanted \nsomething like $800.15 In October 2018, Applicant sold some real estate for $195,000, \nwith an estimated net receipt of $177,975.16 He contacted the creditor the day before the \nsale, and expects to use funds from the sale to resolve the debt.17 There is no \ndocumentary evidence of any payments on the account since the sale. The account has \nnot been resolved. \n (SOR \u00b6 1.c.): This is an unspecified type of account with a past-due and unpaid \nbalance of $12,000 that was placed for collection.18 Applicant set up a payment plan with \nthe creditor calling for monthly $500 payments. Payments were made as agreed, and in \nAugust 2018, the account was satisfied.19 To date, there should be two completed \npreauthorized payments. The account has been resolved. \nIn addition to the accounts alleged in the SOR, Applicant addressed various other \naccounts that were not alleged in the SOR. For example, he had to resolve all of the \ndisputes, debts, and litigation caused by the actions of his two former partners and his \nbank\u2019s unusual dysfunctional activities.20 Other than the accounts alleged in the SOR, \nApplicant is not aware of any other delinquent accounts, and his most recent credit report \ndoes not reflect any additional delinquencies. In March 2018, Applicant prepared a \n                                                          \n11 AE F, supra note 9; Tr. at 43-44. \n \n12 AE L (Sales Contract, dated October 24, 2018). \n \n13 AE K (Letter, dated October 23, 2018); AE J (E-mail, dated October 31, 2018). \n \n14 GE 3, supra note 1, at 6; GE 4, supra note 1, at 2. \n \n15 AE F, supra note 9; Tr. at 43-44. \n \n16 AE L, supra note 12. \n \n17 AE K, supra note 13; AE J, supra note 13. \n \n18 GE 3, supra note 1, at 6; GE 4, supra note 1, at 2. \n \n19 AE H, supra note 9. \n \n20 Tr. at 44. Applicant was sued for roughly $3,500 because of his former partners\u2019 actions, and he \nhad to resolve that debt. \n \n\n  \n  \n6  \n                                        \nPersonal Financial Statement to reflect his assets ($11,756 in cash); real estate \n($470,000); retirement pensions and accounts ($20,678); and liabilities ($423,068), \nincluding the two debts described above.21 During the hearing, Applicant noted that his \ncurrent annual income is $110,000.22 The unanticipated expenses associated with the \nearlier described problems have disappeared, and Applicant has made significant \nprogress in stabilizing his finances and avoiding other financial delinquencies. \nCharacter References \n \n \nA lieutenant in the county sheriff\u2019s office has known Applicant over a number of \nyears, and they have worked together professionally on several high value projects. \nApplicant has proven himself to be an invaluable asset to the team in leading every project \nto a successful conclusion. Applicant has a reputation among colleagues for being \ntrustworthy and punctual. Their professional relationship morphed into a personal \nrelationship, and Applicant is someone the lieutenant can confide in and trust with zero \ndoubts as to his word and his follow through.23 \n \n \nThe owner/operator of a landscape company has known Applicant since \nchildhood, and they have worked together since 2009. Applicant renovated his first \ncorporate office, and later engaged the landscaping company on numerous occasions to \nhandle work for Applicant\u2019s customers. When Applicant\u2019s partners departed, Applicant \ntook the high road and chose to bear the burden of paying off all of their vendors. Instead \nof filing for bankruptcy, Applicant made payoffs rather than leaving his vendors high and \ndry. He respects Applicant on how he has handled himself in becoming financially stable \nagain, and he considers Applicant to be trustworthy, honest, and loyal.24 \n \nA certified public accountant has known Applicant since 2004, as both a friend and \na client. When Applicant\u2019s two partners left the company, they left Applicant with the \nunfinished projects. Although several professionals recommended that Applicant file for \nbankruptcy as a result of the business losses, he refused to do so. Instead, although it \nmeant placing a financial burden on himself and his family, he personally paid off the \noutstanding business debts. He considers Applicant to be a person of integrity with a \nstrong desire to always do the right thing.25 \n  \n \n \n                                                          \n21 AE M (Personal Financial Statement). \n \n22 Tr. at 58. \n \n23 AE P (Character Reference, dated October 25, 2018). \n \n24 AE O (Character Reference, dated October 10, 2018). \n \n25 AE N (Character Reference, dated November 6, 2018). \n \n\n \n7 \n                                      \n \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d26 As Commander in Chief, the President has \nthe authority to control access to information bearing on national security and to \ndetermine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such \ninformation. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to \ngrant an applicant eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that \nit is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d27   \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the guidelines in SEAD 4. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the guidelines list potentially disqualifying \nconditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility \nfor access to classified information. \n \nAn administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules \nof law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known \nas the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a meaningful decision. \n \nIn the decision-making process, facts must be established by \u201csubstantial \nevidence.\u201d28 The Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish \na potentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced \nsubstantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant \nhas the burden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, extenuation \nor mitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government\u2019s case. The \nburden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government.29  \n \n                                                          \n26 Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). \n \n27 Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as \namended and modified.    \n \n28 \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as \nadequate to support a conclusion in light of all contrary evidence in the record.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 04-11463 \nat 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1).  \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla \nbut less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. \n1994). \n \n29 See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \n \n\n \n8 \n                                      \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well. It is \nbecause of this special relationship that the Government must be able to repose a high \ndegree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to classified \ninformation. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. Such \ndecisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather \nthan actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Furthermore, \u201csecurity clearance \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d30  \n \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense \nbe a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d31 Thus, nothing in this \ndecision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole or in \npart, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or \npatriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has or has not met the strict guidelines \nthe President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.  In \nreaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, \nand based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing \ninferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nAt the outset, I note I had ample opportunity to evaluate the demeanor of Applicant, \nobserve his manner and deportment, appraise the way in which he responded to \nquestions, assess his candor or evasiveness, read his statements, and listen to his \ntestimony. It is my impression that his explanations regarding his financial issues are \nconsistent and have the solid resonance of truth. \n \nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, including Applicant\u2019s testimony, as \nwell as an assessment of Applicant\u2019s demeanor and credibility, and after application of all \nappropriate legal precepts and factors, I conclude the following with respect to the \nallegations set forth in the SOR: \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations  \n  \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18:        \n  \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \n                                                          \n30 Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n \n31 See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \n \n\n \n9 \n                                      \n \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage.  \n  \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19:   \n  \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n  \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so;  \n  \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and  \n  \n(e) consistent spending beyond one\u2019s means or frivolous or irresponsible \nspending, which may be indicated by excessive indebtedness, significant \nnegative cash flow, a history of late payments or of non-payment, or other \nnegative financial indicators. \n  \nApplicant had three delinquent accounts totaling approximately $56,139 that had \nbeen placed for collection or charged off. There is no evidence that he was unwilling to \nsatisfy his debts or that he had the ability to do so, and there is no evidence of frivolous \nor irresponsible spending, or consistent spending beyond his means.

Sep. 13, 2016)). \n \n\n \n10 \n                                      \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.33  \n \nI have concluded that AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), 20(b), 20(c), and 20(d) all partially or fully apply. \nApplicant was the owner/operator of a rather successful company. In early 2014, it had \nresidential and commercial properties in various stages of construction, with \napproximately $1,000,000 in outstanding gross billings and approximately $175,000 in \noutstanding short-term liabilities associated primarily with labor and materials for those \njobs. When Applicant\u2019s two crooked partners unexpectedly abandoned the business, they \nleft him with the liabilities, including some that they had improperly and secretly generated \nwithout Applicant\u2019s knowledge. Applicant focused on attempting to complete the \nconstruction jobs that were unfinished, but two customers stopped making payments. He \nsuccessfully sued them and eventually realized some of the funds owed his company. \nApplicant did not ignore his debts. Instead he worked three jobs in order to generate the \nfunds necessary to resolve the debts that resulted from his ex-partners\u2019 actions and the \nrefusal of his customers to timely pay their bills.  \nHowever, as noted above, it was the internal bank processing difficulties of his \nlargely dysfunctional bank in 2015 that resulted in the most lasting damage to his financial \nsituation. One of Applicant\u2019s customers wrote him a check for approximately $54,500. \nThere was nothing wrong with the check, but there was something wrong with the bank. \nOn three occasions, the bank removed the funds from Applicant\u2019s account without his \nknowledge or authorization, leading him to bounce checks to vendors and workmen. The \nexperience and the delays cost Applicant roughly four weeks of production on a \ncommercial project, and his cash-flow was negatively impacted. In October 2015, \nApplicant requested a $20,000 credit line from that same bank to complete two \nconstruction projects and have approximately $155,000 in receivables released to him, \nbut the bank rejected his request. Although Applicant estimated that the bank measures \n                                                          \n33 The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a good-faith effort to repay overdue \ncreditors or otherwise resolve debts: \n \nIn order to qualify for application of [the \u201cgood-faith\u201d mitigating condition], an applicant must \npresent evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or some \nother good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant\u2019s debts. The Directive does not \ndefine the term \u201cgood-faith.\u201d However, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-\nfaith \u201crequires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, \nhonesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.\u201d Accordingly, an applicant must do more than \nmerely show that he or she relied on a legally available option (such as bankruptcy [or \nstatute of limitations]) in order to claim the benefit of [the \u201cgood-faith\u201d mitigating condition].  \n \n(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2004) (quoting \nISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 4, 2001)). \n \n\n \n11 \n                                      \n \ncost him $200,000, and the bank denied any liability for its actions, the bank settled \nApplicant\u2019s claims, and it agreed to pay him $55,000 in September 2016.  \nApplicant did not ignore his creditors. He incurred expenses arising from his ex-\npartners\u2019 actions, and eventually resolved them. He has resolved one of the debts alleged \nin the SOR, and he is in the process of resolving the other two debts. His current annual \nincome is $110,000. The unanticipated expenses associated with the earlier described \nproblems have disappeared, and Applicant has made significant progress in stabilizing \nhis finances and avoiding other financial delinquencies. Applicant\u2019s actions under the \ncircumstances no longer cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good \njudgment.34  \nClearance decisions are aimed at evaluating an applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, \nand trustworthiness. They are not a debt-collection procedure. The guidelines do not \nrequire an applicant to establish resolution of every debt or issue alleged in the SOR. An \napplicant needs only to establish a plan to resolve financial problems and take significant \nactions to implement the plan. There is no requirement that an applicant immediately \nresolve issues or make payments on all delinquent debts simultaneously, nor is there a \nrequirement that the debts or issues alleged in an SOR be resolved first. Rather, a \nreasonable plan and concomitant conduct may provide for the payment of such debts, or \nresolution of such issues, one at a time.   \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(d): \n  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Moreover, I have \n                                                          \n34 See ISCR Case No. 09-08533 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Oct. 6, 2010).  \n  \n\n \n12 \n                                      \n \nevaluated the various aspects of this case in light of the totality of the record evidence \nand have not merely performed a piecemeal analysis.35  \n  \nThere is some evidence against mitigating Applicant\u2019s conduct. Applicant\u2019s S \ncorporation encountered some financial difficulties and delays in completing various \nconstruction and renovation projects. Accounts became delinquent, and two were \ncharged off. On its face, without further explanations, those factors would be viewed in a \nnegative light. However, Applicant was a victim of fraud by two former partners; at least \ntwo of his customers refused or delayed payments to him for work completed; and he was \nthe victim of highly unusual practices of his bank. \n  \nThe mitigating evidence under the whole-person concept is more substantial. \nApplicant is a 39-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been serving as a \ndirector of field applications with his employer since September 2016. He was previously \nthe owner of a highly successful construction corporation from August 2012 until \nDecember 2015. Applicant\u2019s friends and colleagues describe him as a person of integrity \nwho is trustworthy, honest, and loyal. Faced with unanticipated business expenses \ncaused by his two crooked partners, Applicant ignored bankruptcy and instead addressed \nhis creditors. He generated funds by working on three jobs. He completed construction \nand renovation projects; paid off non-SOR creditors he was initially unaware of; satisfied \none SOR account; negotiated settlements with the two accounts he has with the \ndysfunctional bank; and sold a property that should resolve those two remaining SOR \naccounts.  With a current annual income of $110,000, cash in the bank, and no other \ndelinquencies, Applicant\u2019s efforts to restore fiscal stability have been remarkable. His \nfinancial situation is now under control.  \nThe Appeal Board has addressed a key element in the whole-person analysis in \nfinancial cases stating:36 \nIn evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the \nconcept of \u201cmeaningful track record\u201d necessarily includes evidence of actual \ndebt reduction through payment of debts. However, an applicant is not \nrequired, as a matter of law, to establish that he [or she] has paid off each \nand every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an applicant \ndemonstrate that he [or she] has \u201c. . . established a plan to resolve his [or \nher] financial problems and taken significant actions to implement that plan.\u201d \nThe Judge can reasonably consider the entirety of an applicant\u2019s financial \nsituation and his [or her] actions in evaluating the extent to which that \napplicant\u2019s plan for the reduction of his outstanding indebtedness is credible \nand realistic. See Directive \u00b6 E2.2(a) (\u201cAvailable, reliable information about \nthe person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be \nconsidered in reaching a determination.\u201d) There is no requirement that a \n                                                          \n35 See U.S. v. Bottone, 365 F.2d 389, 392 (2d Cir. 1966); See also ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-\n3 (App. Bd. Jun. 2, 2006). \n \n36 ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008) (internal citations omitted). \n \n\n \n13 \n                                      \n \nplan provide for payments on all outstanding debts simultaneously. Rather, \na reasonable plan (and concomitant conduct) may provide for the payment \nof such debts one at a time. Likewise, there is no requirement that the first \ndebts actually paid in furtherance of a reasonable debt plan be the ones \nlisted in the SOR. \nApplicant has demonstrated an outstanding track record of debt reduction and \nelimination efforts, already resolving most of his debts, and he is in the process of \nresolving the two remaining debts. Overall, the evidence leaves me without substantial \nquestions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. \nFor all of these reasons, I conclude Applicant has mitigated the security concerns arising \nfrom his financial considerations. See SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6\u00b6 2(d)(1) through AG 2(d)(9). \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a. through 1.c.:  \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \n In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance.  \nEligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n                                        \n         \n \n \n \n________________________ \nROBERT ROBINSON GALES \nAdministrative Judge \n",

The SOR further informed \nApplicant that, based on information available to the government, DoD adjudicators \ncould not make the preliminary affirmative finding it is clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s security clearance. \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on October 9, 2018, and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge. (Answer.) The case was assigned to me on November \n6, 2018. The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of \nhearing on November 14, 2018, scheduling the hearing for December 3, 2018. The \nhearing was convened as scheduled. The Government offered Exhibits (GXs) 1 through \n6, which were admitted into evidence. Applicant testified on her own behalf. Applicant \npresented one document, which I marked Applicant\u2019s Exhibit (AppX) A, and admitted \ninto evidence. The record was left open until February 3, 2019, for receipt of additional \n\n \n2 \n \ndocumentation. In a timely fashion, Applicant offered four additional packets of \ndocuments, which were also admitted into evidence, as AppXs B~E. DOHA received \nthe transcript of the hearing (TR) on December 11, 2018. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant admitted to all the allegations in SOR.

She has been employed \nas an independent contractor since September of 2014. (GX 1 at page 14.)  She is \nmarried, and has two adult children.

Applicant has \u201csettled\u201d her automobile loan with Creditor A, as evidenced by \ndocumentation from Creditor A. (TR at page 25 line 7 to page 26 line 14, at page 27 line \n5 to page 29 line 23, and AppX B at page 9.) This $20,000 allegation constitutes the \nmajority of Applicant\u2019s alleged past-due indebtedness, and is found for Applicant. \n \n \n1.b. Applicant is making monthly payments of $83 towards an admitted $2,962 \npast-due debt to the satisfaction of Creditor B, as evidenced by documentation from \nCreditor B. (AppX B at pages 10~13.) This allegation is found for Applicant. \n \n \n1.c, 1.d., and 1.f~1.p Since July of 2018, through the auspices of a debt \nconsolidation service, Applicant is making monthly payments of $250 towards these \nthirteen admitted past-due debts totaling about $9,035. (TR at page 19 line 15 to page \n25 line 6, and at page 30 line 22 to page 32 line 5.) This is evidenced by documentation \nfrom her debt consolidation service. (AppX B at pages 1~7.) These allegations are \nfound for Applicant. \n \n \n1.e. Applicant has settled her admitted past-due debt to Creditor E for $494, as \nevidenced by documentation from Creditor E. (AppX D.) This allegation is found for \nApplicant. \n \n \nApplicant performs her job well, as evidenced by numerous letters of \nrecommendation, citations and achievement awards. (AppX C.) \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n3 \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility, the administrative \njudge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief introductory \nexplanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying \nconditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s \nnational security eligibility. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the whole-person concept. The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states the \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \n \n \nA person who applies for access to classified information seeks to enter into a \nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order (EO) 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall \nbe \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the \nloyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \n \n \n \n\n \n4 \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F - Financial Considerations \n \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18: \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. Two are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \n  \nApplicant has admitted to significant past-due indebtedness. The evidence is \nsufficient to raise these disqualifying conditions.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I considered \nall of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 including: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n\n \n5 \n \nApplicant has addressed her past financial difficulties. She has demonstrated \nthat future financial problems are unlikely. Mitigation under AG \u00b6 20 has been \nestablished. Guideline F is found for Applicant.  \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. Applicant has a distinguished history of \nworking as an independent contractor for the State Department as evidenced by a \nplethora of letters of recommendation, citations and achievement awards. (AppX C.) \nShe performs well at her job.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant mitigated the Financial Considerations security concerns.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a.-1.p: \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \n\n \n6 \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility \nfor a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n \n________________________ \nRichard A. Cefola \nAdministrative Judge \n",
