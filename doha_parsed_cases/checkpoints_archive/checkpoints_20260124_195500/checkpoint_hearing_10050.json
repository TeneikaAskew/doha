Sceviour, Esq. \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nFOREMAN, LeRoy F., Administrative Judge: \n \nThis case involves security concerns raised under Guidelines J (Criminal \nConduct) and G (Alcohol Consumption). Eligibility for access to classified information is \ndenied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application on August 21, 2008. On \nAugust 13, 2010, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) sent him a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its preliminary decision to deny his \napplication, citing security concerns under Guidelines J and G. DOHA acted under \nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February \n20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \n(Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) implemented by the Department of \nDefense on September 1, 2006.  \n \n \nApplicant received the SOR on August 20, 2010; answered it on September 30, \n2010; and requested a hearing before an administrative judge. DOHA received the \nMarch 9, 2011\n\n \n2 \n \n \nrequest on October 4, 2010. Department Counsel was ready to proceed on November \n30, 2010, and the case was assigned to me on December 6, 2010. DOHA issued a \nnotice of hearing on January 5, 2011, scheduling it for January 19, 2011. I convened the \nhearing as scheduled. Government Exhibits (GX) 1 through 15 were admitted in \nevidence without objection. Applicant testified and submitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AX) A \nthrough F, which were admitted without objection. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on \nJanuary 31, 2011. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted all the allegations in the SOR. His \nadmissions in his answer and at the hearing are incorporated in my findings of fact.  \n \n \nApplicant is a 51-year-old engineer technician employed by a defense contractor \nsince November 1998. He married in April 1992 and divorced in December 2000. He \nmarried his current spouse in December 2007. He has one adult son from a previous \nrelationship. He served on active duty in the U.S. Navy from September 1978 to \nSeptember 1998. He retired as a chief petty officer (pay grade E-7) and received an \nhonorable discharge. (GX 5.) He held a security clearance while in the Navy. He \nreceived a clearance as a defense contractor employee in March 2002.  \n \n \nIn June 1979, Applicant and several Navy friends were detained by the police for \nshooting fireworks on the beach. The police found several pills in Applicant\u2019s wallet, \nwhich he claimed were caffeine pills. (GX 2 at 4.) He was charged with illegal drug \npossession. He pleaded guilty, was fined $100 (suspended), and placed on probation \nfor three years. The charges were thereafter dismissed on motion of the district \nattorney. (GX 6 at 2.) \n \n \nIn March 1982, Applicant was arrested for disorderly conduct and fined $25. (GX \n7.) In July 1982, he was involved in a brawl. (GX 8.) The SOR alleges that he received \nnonjudicial punishment (a \u201ccaptain\u2019s mast\u201d) under Article 15, Uniform Code of Military \nJustice (UCMJ), 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 815, for assault, and using provoking speech and \ngestures. In his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the allegation that he was \npunished for his involvement in the brawl, but there is no documentary evidence of \nnonjudicial punishment in the record.  \n \nIn April 1988, Applicant was charged with driving under the influence on a Navy \nbase. (GX 9.) In his answer to the SOR, he admitted the allegation that he was \npunished and his driving privileges were suspended, but there is no documentary \nevidence of nonjudicial punishment in the record. \n \nAt the hearing, Applicant testified that he could remember only one instance of \nhaving a captain\u2019s mast, and in that instance the charges were dismissed. He further \ntestified that the captain\u2019s mast was for an incident other than the two alleged in the \nSOR. (Tr. 38-42.) \n\n \n3 \n \n \n \nIn August 1991, Applicant was charged with destroying property. He admitted \nthis offense in his answer to the SOR, but there is no documentary evidence of it in the \nrecord. No evidence of the circumstances of these charges was presented at the \nhearing.  \n \n \nIn August 1997, Applicant was charged with assault and battery on a family \nmember. In February 1998, the court entered a satisfaction and discharge order, \ndismissing the charge upon payment of court costs. (GX 10.) Applicant testified that this \nincident arose after a verbal argument about his then wife\u2019s failure to pay the household \nbills while he was at sea. He denied striking her during the argument, and he testified he \ncould not recall if he had consumed alcohol before the incident. (Tr. 42-44.) \n \n \nIn March 2004, Applicant was charged with two counts of assault and battery as \na result of a bar fight. He was convicted, appealed his conviction, and was convicted \nagain on appeal. He was fined $250, ordered to pay court costs, and sentenced to six \nmonths in jail. The jail sentence was suspended, conditioned on good behavior for two \nyears. (GX 11; Tr. 44-50.)  \n \n \nIn March 2005, Applicant was charged with assault and battery on a family \nmember, as a result of domestic disturbance with his cohabitant. In April 2005, the court \ndeferred findings, placed Applicant on probation for two years, and ordered him to \ncomplete alcohol screening and treatment if required. Applicant completed the alcohol \nscreening and no further treatment was required. (GX 12.) At the hearing, Applicant \ndenied striking his cohabitant, and he testified that he did not recall receiving any \ncounseling. (Tr. 50-53.) \n \n \nIn February 2006, Applicant was charged with driving under the influence (DUI). \nHe pleaded not guilty but was convicted. He was sentenced to 90 days in jail \n(suspended), probation for three years, suspension of his driver\u2019s license for one year, \nand a $350 fine. He was ordered to attend an alcohol safety action program. (GX 13.) \nThe SOR alleges that he was also charged with failure to obey a highway sign, and he \nadmitted the allegation, but there is no documentary evidence of the charge. Applicant \ntestified that he was stopped by a police officer for not stopping completely at a stop \nsign, and then accused of DUI after he failed a field sobriety test and blood-alcohol test. \n \n \nApplicant attended an alcohol abuse counseling program as an outpatient from \nJuly to September 2006. There is no record of any diagnosis or prognosis. (GX 2 at 11.) \nApplicant testified that at that time he did not believe he had an alcohol problem. (Tr. \n54.) \n \n \nIn June 2008, Applicant was charged with refusing to take a breathalyzer test, \nDUI (2nd offense), and two counts of assault and battery on his current wife. He was \nconvicted of refusing to take a breathalyzer test, but he was found not guilty on appeal. \n(GX 14.) At the hearing, he admitted that he refused to take the test because he had \njust consumed a beer and was afraid that he would not pass the test. (Tr. 60.) \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \n \nDuring an interview with a security investigator in October 2008, Applicant \ndeclared that he did not have any problems with excessive alcohol consumption. He \nstated that he had not consumed any alcoholic beverages since June 2008 and did not \nintend to consume alcohol again because it was not worth the risk of further legal \nproblems. (GX 2 at 15-16.) \n \n \nIn December 2009, Applicant was charged with refusing to take a breathalyzer \n(2nd offense), failure to obey a highway sign, and DUI (2nd offense within 5-10 years). In \nJanuary 2010, he was convicted of DUI, and the other charges were disposed of by \nnolle prosequi. He was sentenced to 365 days in jail, with 355 days suspended, and \nfined $500. His driver\u2019s license was suspended for three years, and an ignition interlock \nwas placed on his vehicle for three years. (GX 15.) In response to DOHA interrogatories \nin June 2010, Applicant submitted a letter from a medical doctor, stating that at the time \nof these offenses, he had been treated for a broken arm, was taking a prescribed \nnarcotic pain killer, and had a new cast on his wrist and forearm, all of which could have \nimpaired his driving ability. (GX 4 at 4.) At the hearing, he admitted having a couple of \nmixed drinks after taking his pain medication. He testified he did not read the \ninstructions on his medication cautioning against consuming alcohol while using the \nmedication. (Tr. 62-63.) \n \n \nIn response to DOHA interrogatories in June 2010, Applicant stated that he \ncontinued to drink alcoholic beverages. He stated that he consumed six cans of beer \nbiweekly and an occasional glass of wine with dinner, but that he seldom drank liquor. \n(GX 3 at 2.) \n \n \nIn June 2010, Applicant successfully completed a 12-week substance abuse \ntreatment program. A report from a licensed professional counselor stated that \nApplicant was \u201can exceptional participant\u201d in the group counseling program. She stated, \n\u201cAt the time that the group ended, [Applicant] seemed to have a realistic understanding \nof how alcohol could affect him and was committed to implementing lifestyle changes \nthat would enable him to cope more adaptively.\u201d The counselor was a member of a \npsychiatric services practice composed of medical doctors, psychologists, licensed \nclinical social workers, and licensed professional counselors. (AX A.) No evidence was \npresented showing that a licensed professional counselor has credentials equal to or \nhigher than a licensed clinical social worker. \n \n \nApplicant testified that in January 2010, he and his wife \u201cmade a pact\u201d that they \nwould no longer consume alcohol. (Tr. 31-32, 34-35.) He admitted that he had a drink \nwith his son in August 2010, and he had a \u201cfew beers\u201d after a golf outing in November \n2010. (Tr. 74-75.) \n \n \nApplicant is attending Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) meetings, but he is still at the \nfirst step. He is required by court order to attend at least one meeting a week, but he \nhas been attending two or three a week when his work schedule permits. (Tr. 32.) He \ntestified that he is in the first step of recovery and has not yet admitted at an AA meeting \n\n \n5 \n \n \nthat he is an alcoholic, even though he has attended about 100 meetings. (Tr. 72-73.) \nHe admitted at the hearing that he now considers himself an alcoholic. (Tr. 31, 66.) \n \n \nApplicant testified that he has fully disclosed his criminal record and alcohol \ninvolvement to his employer. (Tr. 33-34.) Several of Applicant\u2019s supervisors, coworkers, \nand friends submitted sworn statements attesting to his good character. Applicant\u2019s \nimmediate supervisor and friend, who has known him for more than 20 years, stated \nthat he is \u201call business\u201d at work, highly respected, knowledgeable, and extremely careful \nwith classified material. (AX B.) Applicant\u2019s manager since April 2007 describes him as \nhighly reliable, trustworthy, honest, and conscientious about handling classified \nmaterial. (AX C.) Applicant\u2019s deputy program manager, who has known him for 12 \nyears, considers him one of their best supervisors and a person of extraordinary \ncharacter. (AX D.) A coworker and friend, who has known Applicant for 30 years, \nregards him as a very balanced individual and \u201ca man of dignity with a high regard of \nduty.\u201d (AX E.) Another coworker and friend, who has known Applicant for 11 years, \ndescribes him as a hard-working, \u201cno nonsense\u201d worker who is also compassionate and \ncaring. (AX F.) \n \nPolicies \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended.   \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the AG. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, \nrecognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in \nconjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. \n\n \n6 \n \n \nOr. 10865 \u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the \napplicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense \nhave established for issuing a clearance. \n \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in \nthe personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant \nfrom being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden \nof establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 92-1106 \nat 3, 1993 WL 545051 at *3 (App. Bd. Oct. 7, 1993).   \n \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \n \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. \n01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, \nif they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct \nThe SOR alleges 11 instances of criminal charges against Applicant, starting in \nJune 1979 and ending in December 2009 (SOR \u00b6 1.a-1.k). The security concern \nrelating under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 30: \u201cCriminal activity creates doubt about \na person's judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into \nquestion a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations.\u201d \nThe relevant disqualifying conditions are: AG \u00b6 31(a) (\u201ca single serious crime or \nmultiple lesser offenses\u201d); AG \u00b6 31(c) (\u201callegation or admission of criminal conduct, \nregardless of whether the person was formally charged, formally prosecuted, or \nconvicted\u201d); and AG \u00b6 31(d) (\u201cindividual is currently on parole or probation\u201d). Applicant\u2019s \nadmissions and the documentary evidence presented at the hearing establish AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n31(a) and (c). Applicant\u2019s three-year probation, imposed in January 2010 for his DUI \nconviction, which he admitted and which is established by documentary evidence, \nestablishes AG \u00b6 31(d). Thus, the burden shifted to Applicant to rebut, explain, \nextenuate, or mitigate the facts. \n\n \n7 \n \n \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline may be mitigated by evidence that \u201cso \nmuch time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it happened under \nsuch unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d AG \u00b6 32(a). This mitigating \ncondition is not established because Applicant\u2019s criminal conduct was recent and did \nnot happen under unusual circumstances. \n \n \nSecurity concerns raised by criminal conduct also may be mitigated by \u201cevidence \nthat the person did not commit the offense.\u201d AG \u00b6 32(c). Applicant denied receiving \nnonjudicial punishment for the offenses alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c and 1.d, and there is no \ndocumentary evidence in the record showing nonjudicial punishment, but he admitted \nthe underlying conduct and his admissions are corroborated by documentary evidence. \nThus, AG \u00b6 32(c) is not established. \n \n \nSecurity concerns also may be mitigated if \u201cthere is evidence of successful \nrehabilitation; including but not limited to the passage of time without recurrence of \ncriminal activity, remorse or restitution, job training or higher education, good \nemployment record, or constructive community involvement.\u201d AG \u00b6 32(d). Applicant has \ntaken steps in the right direction, he is remorseful, and he has continued his record of \noutstanding performance at work. However, AG \u00b6 32(d) is not established, because not \nenough time has elapsed to demonstrate rehabilitation. His last DUI conviction was in \nJanuary 2010. He last consumed alcohol in November 2010, about two months before \nthe hearing. He is still on probation, the interlock has not yet been removed from his \nautomobile, and he has yet to acknowledge to his fellow AA members that he is an \nalcoholic.  \n \nGuideline G (Alcohol Consumption) \n \n \nThe SOR \u00b6 2.a cross-alleges the conduct in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d, 1.h, 1.i, 1.j, and 1.k \nunder this guideline. It also alleges Applicant\u2019s alcohol treatment in July-September \n2006 (SOR \u00b6 2.b) and April-June 2010 (SOR \u00b6 2.c). Finally, it alleges that he \ncontinues to drink alcohol (SOR \u00b6 2.d). \n \n \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 21 as follows: \u201cExcessive \nalcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment or the \nfailure to control impulses, and can raise questions about an individual's reliability and \ntrustworthiness.\u201d The following disqualifying conditions are relevant: \n \nAG \u00b6 22(a): Alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving \nwhile under the influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the \npeace, or other incidents of concern, regardless of whether the individual \nis diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent; \n \nAG \u00b6 22(c): Habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of \nimpaired judgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as \nan alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent; \n\n \n8 \n \n \nAG \u00b6 22(d): Diagnosis by a duly qualified medical professional (e.g., \nphysician, clinical psychologist, or psychiatrist) of alcohol abuse or alcohol \ndependence;  \n \nAG \u00b6 22(e): Evaluation of alcohol abuse or alcohol dependence by a \nlicensed clinical social worker who is a staff member of a recognized \nalcohol treatment program; and \n \nAG \u00b6 22(f): Relapse after diagnosis of alcohol abuse or dependence and \ncompletion of an alcohol rehabilitation program.  \n \n \nAlthough Applicant was required to undergo alcohol screening after the incident \nin SOR \u00b6 1.h, there is no evidence in the record showing that the incident was alcohol-\nrelated. However, the evidence regarding the incidents alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d, 1.i, 1.j, \nand 1.k is sufficient to establish AG \u00b6 22(a).  \n \n \nThere is no evidence of binge drinking, but there is evidence that Applicant drank \nto the point of intoxication on several occasions alleged in this SOR. This evidence is \nsufficient to establish AG \u00b6 23(c). \n \n \nThere is no evidence that Applicant has been diagnosed as alcohol dependent or \nsuffering from alcohol abuse. Furthermore, there is no evidence that the \u201clicensed \nprofessional counselor\u201d who evaluated Applicant in June 2010 held credentials \nequivalent to or greater than a licensed clinical social worker. Thus, I conclude that AG \n\u00b6\u00b6 22(d), (e), and (f) are not established. \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline may be mitigated if \u201cso much time has \npassed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it happened under such unusual \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on the individual's \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d AG \u00b6 23(a). For the reasons set \nout in the above discussion of AG \u00b6 32(a), I conclude that this mitigating condition is not \nestablished.  \n \n \nSecurity concerns also may be mitigated if \u201cthe individual acknowledges his or \nher alcoholism or issues of alcohol abuse, provides evidence of actions taken to \novercome this problem, and has established a pattern of abstinence (if alcohol \ndependent) or responsible use (if an alcohol abuser).\u201d AG \u00b6 23(b). This mitigating \ncondition is partially established by Applicant\u2019s acknowledgment that he is an alcoholic, \nand evidence of his alcohol treatment and participation in AA. However, his period of \nabstinence is too short to establish a \u201cpattern of abstinence.\u201d  \n \n \nFinally, security concerns under this guideline may be mitigated if: \n \nThe individual has successfully completed inpatient or outpatient \ncounseling or rehabilitation along with any required aftercare, has \ndemonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or \n\n \n9 \n \n \nabstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations, such as \nparticipation in meetings of Alcoholics Anonymous or a similar \norganization and has received a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified \nmedical professional or a licensed clinical social worker who is a staff \nmember of a recognized alcohol treatment program.  \n \nAG \u00b6 23(d). Applicant has successfully completed several alcohol treatment programs \nand is participating in AA. However, this mitigating condition is not established because \nthere is no evidence that the favorable recommendation he received in June 2010 was \nfrom a qualified medical professional or the equivalent of a licensed clinical social \nworker. \n \n \nThe allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.b and 2.c do not allege conduct falling under any of \nthe enumerated disqualifying conditions under this guideline. Both periods of treatment \nwere consequences of his criminal conduct. Applicant\u2019s successful completion of these \nprograms is favorable rather than unfavorable conduct. Accordingly, I resolve SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n2.b and 2.c in his favor. \n \n \nThe allegation in SOR \u00b6 2.d, alleging that Applicant continues to drink alcohol, is \nnot supported by substantial evidence. Applicant\u2019s testimony establishes that he last \nconsumed alcohol in November 2010. The Government presented no evidence that he \nconsumed alcohol after that date. Thus, I resolve SOR \u00b6 2.d in his favor. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the relevant circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline J and G in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in \nAG \u00b6 2(a) were addressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional \ncomment. \n \n\n \n10 \n \n \n \nApplicant is a mature, intelligent adult. He served honorably in the Navy and he \nhas served with distinction as an employee of a defense contractor. He has held a \nsecurity clearance for most of his adult life. He was sincere and candid at the hearing. \nUnfortunately, he is still struggling to overcome his problems with alcohol, and he has \nnot yet established a track record of sobriety. Insufficient time has passed to \ndemonstrate rehabilitation.  \n \n \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guidelines J and \nG, and evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude \nApplicant has not mitigated the security concerns based on criminal conduct and \nalcohol consumption. Accordingly, I conclude he has not carried his burden of showing \nthat it is clearly consistent with the national interest to continue his eligibility for access \nto classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline J (Criminal Conduct):     AGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.b: \n \n \n    Against Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.c-1.d: \n \n \n    Against Applicant  \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.e-1.k: \n \n \n    Against Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline G (Alcohol Consumption): AGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \n     Against Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 2.b-2.d: \n \n \n     For Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to continue \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified \ninformation is denied. \n \n \n \n \nLeRoy F. Foreman \nAdministrative Judge \n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant admitted all but one of the factual allegations in the SOR. I included Applicant's admissions in my findings of fact. After a thorough review of the pleadings, transcript, and exhibits, I make the following essential findings of fact. Applicant is 29 years old and has worked as an engineering technician for a defense contractor for approximately two years. He served four years on active duty with the Marine Corps, and four year in the Marine Corps Reserve as a food service specialist. He received an honorable discharge. He did not hold a security clearance while in the Marine Corps. Applicant was married for five years but is now divorced. He has paid his attorney's fees associated with the divorce. He has two children, a ten- year-old son from a prior relationship, and a seven-year-old daughter with his former wife. He has custody of his daughter. He pays child support for his son and his wife pays child support for their daughter. Applicant's monthly pay is approximately $1,700, but his monthly child support payments of $215 have been taken from his pay. His wife's support payment for the daughter is $392, for a total income of $2,192. His expenses are approximately $1,800 to include day care for his daughter. He has approximately $300 monthly in discretionary funds available. A relative has now agreed to provide child care for no charge freeing an additional $460 in monthly discretionary funds (Tr. 51-63; Gov. Ex. 1, e-QIP, dated November 12, 200",

The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and \neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on October 9, 2009.1 \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on September 18, 2009, admitting 30 of \nthe 31 allegations under Guideline F. He requested a hearing before an administrative \n \n1 \n \n \n                                                          \n1 The receipt for the SOR is dated 21 days after the date of the written answer to the SOR. \nFebruary 25, 2010\n\n \n2 \n \n \njudge. Department Counsel was prepared to proceed on November 5, 2009, and the \ncase was assigned to me on November 17, 2009. DOHA issued a Notice of Hearing on \nNovember 20, 2009, scheduling a hearing for December 9, 2009. I convened the \nhearing as scheduled. The government offered six exhibits, marked Government \nExhibits (Gov. Ex.) 1 through 6, which were received without objection. Applicant and \none witness testified on his behalf. Applicant offered 13 exhibits, marked App. Ex. A \nthrough M, which were received without objection. I kept the record open for Applicant \nto file additional documents. Applicant timely filed 23 documents marked App. Ex. N \nthrough II, which were received without objection (Gov. Ex. 7, Memorandum, dated \nJanuary 7, 2010. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on December 24, \n2009. Based on a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility \nfor access to classified information is granted.  \n \nProcedural Issues \n \n \nApplicant received the Notice of Hearing on November 30, 2009, nine days \nbefore the hearing. Applicant is entitled to 15 days advance notice of the hearing \n(Directive E3.1.8). Applicant discussed with Department Counsel the hearing date of \nDecember 9, 2009, before the Notice of Hearing was issued on November 20, 2009. \nSince Applicant discussed the hearing date with Department counsel before the Notice \nof Hearing was issued, actual notice was given more than 15 days before the hearing. \nAt the hearing, Applicant waived the 15 days notice requirement (Tr. 5-8). \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant admitted all but one of the factual allegations in the SOR. I included \nApplicant's admissions in my findings of fact. After a thorough review of the pleadings, \ntranscript, and exhibits, I make the following essential findings of fact.   \n \nApplicant is 29 years old and has worked as an engineering technician for a \ndefense contractor for approximately two years. He served four years on active duty \nwith the Marine Corps, and four year in the Marine Corps Reserve as a food service \nspecialist. He received an honorable discharge. He did not hold a security clearance \nwhile in the Marine Corps. Applicant was married for five years but is now divorced. He \nhas paid his attorney's fees associated with the divorce. He has two children, a ten-\nyear-old son from a prior relationship, and a seven-year-old daughter with his former \nwife. He has custody of his daughter. He pays child support for his son and his wife \npays child support for their daughter. Applicant's monthly pay is approximately $1,700, \nbut his monthly child support payments of $215 have been taken from his pay. His \nwife's support payment for the daughter is $392, for a total income of $2,192. His \nexpenses are approximately $1,800 to include day care for his daughter. He has \napproximately $300 monthly in discretionary funds available. A relative has now agreed \nto provide child care for no charge freeing an additional $460 in monthly discretionary \nfunds (Tr. 51-63; Gov. Ex. 1, e-QIP, dated November 12, 2008; App. Ex. C, Attorney's \nletter, dated September 22, 2009; App. Ex. N, Letter, dated December 31, 2009). \n\n \n3 \n \n \nCredit reports (Gov. Ex. 4, dated November 5, 2009; Gov. Ex. 5, dated June 22, \n2009; and Gov. Ex. 6, dated November 25,2008) show the following delinquent debts \nfor Applicant: a car repossession debt for $22,755 (SOR 1.a and SOR 1.cc); a credit \ncard debt for $2,051 (SOR 1.b); a television cable debt for $522 (SOR 1.c); medical \ndebts for $50 (SOR 1.d), $50 (SOR 1.e), $15 (SOR 1.f), $15 (SOR 1.g), $50 (SOR 1.h), \n$15 (SOR 1.i), $50 (SOR 1.j), $50 (SOR 1.k), $50 (SOR 1.l), $50 (SOR 1.m), and $50 \n(SOR 1.n); a debt to a jeweler for $173 (SOR 1.o); an utility bill for $495 (SOR 1.p); a \ntelephone debt to different service providers for $477 (SOR 1.q), $138 (SOR 1.r), and \n$464 (SOR 1.s); another medical debt for $104 (SOR 1.t); a debt for a computer \npurchase for $3,125 (SOR 1.u); another telephone provider debt for $189 (SOR 1.v); a \ndebt for furniture for $4,384 (SOR 1.w); three additional medical debts for $50 (SOR \n1.x), $149 (SOR 1.y), and $206 (SOR 1.z); a credit card debt of $211 (SOR 1.aa); a \ntelevision cable debt of $239 (SOR 1.bb); a debt to a tax preparer for $111 (SOR 1.dd); \nand a credit card debt of $1,500 (SOR 1.ee). \n \nThe delinquent debts at SOR 1.a and 1.cc for car repossession are the same \ndebt. Applicant and his former wife purchased the car together. At the time, they had \ntwo incomes. Applicant's wife quit her job in January 2003 and worked only for a short \ntime in late 2003 and early 2004. She left Applicant in 2004. With the loss of income, \nApplicant was not able to make the required car payments. The car was repossessed \nand after sale the debt remained. The debt was sold by the credit union that was the \noriginal creditor to a collection agency. He contacted the collection agency and offered a \nsettlement paying $110 monthly. He has not received a reply (Tr. 21-27; App. Ex. G and \nT, Letter, dated September 23, 2009; App. Ex. U, Letter, dated December 13, 2009). \n \nThe delinquent debt at SOR 1.b is for a credit card. Applicant has a payment plan \nfor $33 monthly. He made a payment in September 2009, but because of divorce \nexpenses was unable to make a payment in October and November 2009. He was to \nmake a payment in December 2009 (Tr. 28-29; App. Ex. I, statement, dated September \n17, 2009; App. Ex. BB, Letter, dated December 13, 2009). \n \nThe delinquent debt at SOR 1.c for $522 is for cable television service. Applicant \nstates that the debt is for only $192. He is waiting for verification of the amount of the \ndebt from the creditor. He will settle the debt and enter into a payment plan (Tr. 30-31; \nApp. Ex. CC, and App. Ex. DD, Letters, dated December 13, 2009). \n \nThe delinquent debts at SOR 1.d to SOR 1.n, and SOR 1.x may be for medical \nco-payments for medical treatment for his former wife and son. Applicant provided \nhealth insurance for his wife until the divorce was final. He also provided medical \ninsurance for his son. Applicant does not know about any of the debts but assumes they \nare for the co-pays for his former wife and his son. He has written the creditors to learn \nabout the debts. He has not received a reply (Tr. 31-34, 46; App. Ex. Z, Letters, dated \nDecember 13, 2009). \n \nThe delinquent debt at SOR 1.o for $173 was in collection for a jeweler. Applicant \nsettled the debt for $150, and paid it in full (Tr. 35-36; App. Ex. H, Notice, dated \n\n \n4 \n \n \nSeptember 17, 2009; App. Ex. O, Checks, dated December 12, 2009 ($66.63), and \nJanuary 12, 2010 ($100): App. Ex. Q, Bank statement, dated December 31. 2009; App. \nEx. Y, Letter, dated December 13, 2009) \n \nThe delinquent debt at SOR 1.p is for a utility debt. Applicant contacted the \ncreditor and was informed they no longer have the debt. He contacted the utility \ncompany as the original creditor and was informed they also no longer have the debt. \nApplicant is willing to reach a settlement agreement as soon as he knows the contact \ninformation for the creditor (Tr. 36-37). \n \nThe delinquent debt at SOR 1.q for $477.21 is in collection for telephone service. \nApplicant agreed to a payment plan (App. Ex. K, Statement, dated September 21, 2009; \nApp. Ex. GG, Letter, dated December 13, 2009). Applicant has made payments \naccording to the plan (Tr. 37; App. Ex. O, Check, dated December 29, 2009; App. Ex. \nQ, Bank statement, dated December 31. 2009). The delinquent debt at SOR 1.r for \n$138.21 is to the same collection agency for another telephone debt for a different \nservice provider. Applicant agreed to a settlement of this debt (App. Ex. L, Statement, \ndated October 6, 2009; App. Ex. GG, Letter, dated December 13, 2009). Applicant has \nmade one payment according to this plan (Tr. 37; App. Ex. O, Check, dated December \n29, 2009; App. Ex. Q, Bank statement, dated December 31. 2009). The delinquent debt \nat SOR 1.s for $464.24 is in collection to the same collection agency for a different \ntelephone provider. Applicant agreed to a settlement of this debt paying $50 per month. \nHe has been unable to make a payment under this plan (Tr. 38; App. Ex. M, Statement, \ndated October 20, 2009; App. Ex. GG, Letter, dated December 13, 2009).   \n \nThe delinquent debt at SOR 1.t for $104 may be a co-pay for medical service \nprovided his former wife. Applicant does not know the location or contact information for \nthe creditor. At the time the debt accrued, Applicant was in the northeast part of the \ncountry, and his wife was living in the southeast. He contacted the creditor offering to \npay $15 monthly on the debt. He has not received a reply (Tr. 38-41; App. Ex. FF, letter, \ndated December 13, 2009). \n \nThe delinquent debt at SOR 1.u for $3,125 is for a computer Applicant and his \nformer wife purchased together when Applicant was still on active duty. Payments were \nmade on the debt until his wife quit her job in early 2003. No payments have been made \nsince then. The creditor offered to settle the account for $1,923.97. Applicant was \nunable to make this payment. He contacted the creditor to arrange a settlement and \npayment plan offering to pay $50 monthly. His first payment was made on December \n11, 2009 (Tr. 41-42, 44; App. Ex. J, Notice, dated, undated; App. Ex. EE, Letter, dated \nDecember 13, 2009; App. Ex. R, Bank statement, dated December 31, 2009). \n \nThe delinquent debt at SOR 1.v for $189 is for another telephone service debt. \nApplicant agreed to a settlement total of $110, paying $18 monthly. He made one \npayment in September 2009 of $18 but was unable to make the October and November \npayments. He contacted the creditor and agreed to continue to make the payments \nstarting in December 2009 (Tr. 42-44; App. Ex. V, Letter, dated December 13, 2009). \n\n \n5 \n \n \nThe delinquent debt at SOR 1.w for $4,384 is for furniture Applicant and his \nformer wife purchased in May 2002. A limited number of payments were made with the \nlast one in August 2002. The account was initially closed by the creditor and listed as \nclosed for profit and loss. Applicant again contacted the creditor and agreed to a \npayment plan of $30 monthly. A payment of $55 was made on this plan on December \n11, 2009 (Tr. 44-46; App. Ex. V, Creditor's letter, dated December 14, 2009; App. Ex. P, \ncancelled check, dated December 20, 2009). \n \nThe delinquent debts at SOR 1.y for $149 and SOR 1.z for $206 are also medical \ndebts for medical services provided either his former wife or his son. Applicant was \nunaware of these debts. He has contacted the creditors for information concerning the \ndebts and offered a settlement plan paying $20 or $30 monthly on each debt. He has \nnot received a reply from the creditors (Tr. 46-48; App. Ex. X, Letters, dated December \n13, 2009). \n \nThe delinquent debt at SOR 1.aa for $211 is for a gas credit card. Applicant \nbelieved he paid this debt in full. However, he contacted the creditor and learned it is a \nvalid debt. He has started making payments on the debt (Tr. 48; App. Ex. O, Check, \ndated December 15, 2009; App. Ex. Q, bank statement, dated December 31, 2009). \n \nThe delinquent debt at SOR 1.bb for $239 is for television cable service. \nApplicant believed the debt was from a promotional agreement when the original \ncreditor commenced cable service in his area. He contacted both the original creditor \nand the collection agency concerning the debt. Neither creditor had information on the \ndebt. However, Applicant offered a settlement agreement with the original creditor \npaying $23 monthly (Tr. 49-50; App. Ex. AA and DD, Letters, dated December 13, \n2009). \n \nThe delinquent debt at SOR 1.dd for $111 is for a tax preparation services. The \nservice fee was paid when Applicant received his tax refund and the debt is paid in full \n(Tr. 50-51; App. Ex. W, Letters, dated December 13, 2009, and December 30, 2009). \n \nThe delinquent debt at SOR 1.ee for $1,500 is for a military credit card. The debt \nwas paid in full in 2005 (Tr. 51; App. Ex. F and S, Letter, dated September 25, 2009). \n \nApplicant has been receiving financial counseling from a friend who is a loan \nofficer (App. Ex. B, letter, dated September 22, 2009). Applicant has also attended \nclasses provided by his employer in managing money and personal budgeting (App. Ex. \nN, Letter, dated December 31, 2009). \n \nApplicant is considered an excellent employee by his company. His immediate \nsupervisors noted that Applicant is an exemplary employee with excellent work ethic \nand abilities. He is considered dedicated and trustworthy. He earned the confidence and \nrespect of his supervisors (App. Ex. D, letter, dated December 8, 2009). Applicant is \nalso considered one of the most reliable employees in his division. He continues to \nprovide his employer with a quality product (App. Ex. E, letter, undated).  \n\n \n6 \n \n \nPolicies \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which must be considered \nin evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n \nAnalysis \n \nFinancial Considerations \n \n \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by \n\n \n7 \n \n \nrules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information. An individual who is \nfinancially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds \n(AG \u00b6 18). Similarly, an individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or careless in their obligations to protect classified \ninformation. Behaving responsibly or irresponsibly in one aspect of life provides an \nindication of how a person may behave in other aspects of life.  \n \n \nA person\u2019s relationship with his creditors is a private matter until evidence is \nuncovered demonstrating an inability or unwillingness to repay debts under agreed \nterms. Absent evidence of strong extenuating or mitigating circumstances, an applicant \nwith a history of serious or recurring financial difficulties is in a situation of risk \ninconsistent with the holding of a security clearance. An applicant is not required to be \ndebt free, but is required to manage his finances in such a way as to meet his financial \nobligations.  \n \n \nThe delinquent debts listed in credit reports for Applicant are a security concern \nraising Financial Consideration Disqualifying Conditions (FC DC) \u00b6 AG 19(a) (inability or \nunwillingness to satisfy debts), and FC DC AG \u00b6 19(c) (a history of not meeting financial \nobligations). Applicant incurred delinquent debt after his former wife quit her job and the \ncouple could not pay their debts on one income. His former wife then left Applicant and \nhe incurred medical debt from co-pays for her medical care that he was not aware of. \nHe has not been able to make payments on many of his delinquent debts.     \n \n \nI considered Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions (FC MC) AG \u00b6 20(a) \n(the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment), and FC MC AG \u00b6 20(b) (the \nconditions that resulted in the financial problems were largely beyond the person\u2019s \ncontrol (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical \nemergency, or a death, divorce, or separation), and the individual acted responsibly \nunder the circumstances). These mitigating conditions partially apply. Applicant's \nfinancial problems started when he went from a two income family to one income. His \ndebts became significantly delinquent when his former wife quit her job. He could no \nlonger meet his financial obligations. His wife then left him and he incurred medical debt \nfor her medical care. He was not aware of these debts until he received the SOR. Some \nof his debts, but not all, were caused by conditions beyond his control. However, that \nwas not totally a situation beyond his control. The debts were incurred in the normal \ncourse of financial activities. He incurred those debts because he and his former wife \noverextended themselves financially and lost income because his wife quit her job. \nSome of the debts have been paid, but having to pay his divorce attorney has prevented \nhim from paying on his other debts. Most of the debts are still outstanding, and as such \nare current debts. However, the circumstances of his delinquent debts should not recur \nbecause Applicant is receiving financial counseling, understands budgeting, is \nemployed with a good salary, and is now divorced. Applicant has contacted most of his \n\n \n8 \n \n \ncreditors, is paying the delinquent debts that he can, and is thereby acting responsibly \ntoward his debts.  \n \n \nI considered FC MC AG \u00b6 20(c) (the person has received or is receiving \ncounseling for the problem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control). The mitigating condition applies. After receiving the SOR, \nApplicant sought out credit counsel. He is receiving financial counseling from a loan \nofficer and has attended classes for understanding finances and developing and \nimplementing a personal budget. There are clear indications that he is following the \nadvice of the loan officer. His debts have either been paid, are being paid, or he is \nwaiting for information from creditors. \n \nI considered FC MC \u00b6 20(d) (the individual has initiated a good-faith effort to \nrepay the overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts). For FC MC \u00b6 20(d) to apply, \nthere must be an \u201cability\u201d to repay the debts, the \u201cdesire\u201d to repay, and \u201cevidence\u201d of a \ngood-faith effort to repay. A systematic method of handling debts is needed. Applicant \nmust establish a \"meaningful track record\" of debt payment. A \"meaningful track record\" \nof debt payment can be established by evidence of actual debt payments or reduction of \ndebt through payment of debts. An applicant is not required to establish that he paid \neach and every debt listed. The entirety of an Applicant\u2019s financial situation and his \nactions can reasonably be considered in evaluating the extent to which that Applicant\u2019s \nplan for the reduction of his outstanding indebtedness is credible and realistic. \nAvailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, should be considered in reaching a determination. There is no requirement \nthat a plan provide for payments on all outstanding debts simultaneously. Rather, a \nreasonable plan and committed conduct may provide for the payment of such debts one \nat a time. Likewise, there is no requirement that the first debts actually paid in \nfurtherance of a reasonable debt plan be the ones listed in the SOR. All that is required \nis that Applicant demonstrates he has established a plan to resolve his financial \nproblems and taken significant actions to implement that plan.   \n \nApplicant has paid 3 of his 34 delinquent debts, is paying according to payment \nplans seven other debts, and offered to enter payment plans on seven other debts. He \nis unaware of 12 other debts, many of which are small medical co-pays which he \nbelieves are for his former wife or son. However, he has contacted the creditors asking \nfor details on the debts and stated his intention to enter payment plans with the \ncreditors. Applicant's actions paying and resolving his delinquent debts is significant and \nconstitutes credible information to establish a meaningful track record of debt payment, \nand shows that he acted reasonably under the circumstances.  \n \nApplicant has acted responsibly towards his debts and finances under the \ncircumstances. Applicant presented sufficient information to mitigate security concerns \nfor financial considerations by establishing that he has or is paying his delinquent debts, \nand has payment plans to pay his delinquent debts. His finances do not indicate a \nsecurity concern.   \n \n\n \n9 \n \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information by considering the totality of the \napplicant\u2019s conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider \nthe nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for access to \nclassified information must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I considered that Applicant has a \nreputation in the company for reliability, honesty, and trustworthiness.  \n \n \nApplicant must establish a \"meaningful track record\" of debt payment, including \nevidence of actual debt reduction through payment of debts. He is not required, as a \nmatter of law, to establish that he paid each and every debt listed in the SOR. All that is \nrequired is that he has a plan to resolve his financial problems and takes significant \naction to implement that plan. The entirety of his financial situation and his actions can \nreasonably be considered in evaluating the extent to which his actions to reduce his \noutstanding indebtedness are credible and realistic. Available, reliable information about \nthe person's behavior, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be \nconsidered in reaching a determination. There is no requirement that a plan provide for \npayments on all outstanding debts simultaneously. Rather, a reasonable plan and \nconcomitant conduct may provide for the payment of such debts one at a time \n \n \nApplicant established a meaningful track record of debt payment of his \ndelinquent debts. The debts incurred are not the type indicating poor self-control, lack of \njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations. Applicant's financial \nproblems started when his wife no longer had a job, and further contributed by their \ndivorce. Applicant got behind on his finances and was unable to pay his obligations in a \ntimely manner. Applicant is now in control of his finances and is making timely \npayments on his debts. He has or is paying those debts for which he has payment or \ncontact information. He has contacted his creditors to verify his debts and offered to \nenter into payment plans when his debts have been verified. He has paid, is paying, or \n\n \n10 \n \n \nwill shortly start paying on all of his SOR debts. He is living within his means and paying \nhis obligations in a timely manner.  \n \n \nThe issue is not simply whether all of Applicant's debts are paid. It is whether his \nfinancial circumstances raise concerns about his fitness to hold as security clearance. \nApplicant established that he acted reasonably and responsibly towards his finances \nindicating he will act reasonably and responsibly to protect classified information. The \nmanagement of his finances indicates he will be concerned, responsible, and not \ncareless concerning classified information. Overall, the record evidence leaves me with \nno questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for access to classified \ninformation. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant has mitigated the security \nconcerns arising from his financial situation. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.ee:  \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for access to \nclassified information. Clearance is granted. \n \n \n \n_________________ \nTHOMAS M. CREAN \nAdministrative Judge \n",

The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) effective in the Department of Defense on September 1, \n2006.  \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on November 14, 2009, admitting 19 and denying \nfive of the 24 allegations under Guideline F. Applicant provided additional information on \nJanuary 25, 2010. Applicant provided a detailed explanation of the status of his debts in \nboth of his answers. Applicant initially requested a decision on the record and a File of \nRelevant Material (FORM) was prepared by Department Counsel. (Gov. Ex. G, dated \nFebruary 23, 2010) Applicant later requested a hearing before an administrative judge. \n(Case File, letter, dated March 8. 2010) Department Counsel was prepared to proceed \n \n1 \n \n \nJune 3, 2010\n\n \n2 \n \n \non March 12, 2010, and the case was assigned to me on March 17, 2010. DOHA issued \na Notice of Hearing on March 22, 2010, scheduling a hearing for April 8, 2010. I \nconvened the hearing as scheduled. The government offered six exhibits, marked \nGovernment Exhibits (Gov. Ex.) 1 through 6, which were admitted without objection. \nApplicant and one witness testified on his behalf. He offered 13 exhibits, marked \nApplicant Exhibit (App. Ex.) A through N, which were admitted without objection. DOHA \nreceived the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on April 15, 2010. Based on a review of the \ncase file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified \ninformation is granted.  \n \nProcedural Issues \n \n \nApplicant is entitled to 15 days advance notice of the hearing. (Directive \u00b6 \nE3.1.8) Applicant discussed with Department Counsel the hearing date of April 8, 2010, \nbefore the Notice of Hearing was mailed. At the hearing, Applicant waived the 15 days \nnotice requirement. (Tr. 8-9) \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant admitted 19 of the 24 factual allegations in the SOR. I include \nApplicant's admission in my findings of fact. After a thorough review of the pleadings, \ntranscript, and exhibits, I make the following essential findings of fact.   \n \nApplicant is 36 years old, and has worked as an electronics technician III for a \ndefense contractor building network infrastructures for approximately one year. He has \nbeen married since 2004 and has no children. He is a high school graduate with some \ncollege credits. (Tr. 30-32; Gov. Ex. 1, e-QIP, dated June 24, 2008) At the time of the \nhearing, both Applicant and his wife were unemployed and drawing unemployment \ninsurance. (App. Ex. M, Unemployment Approval, dated February 18, 2010) Applicant is \non administrative leave from his employer pending resolution of his request for a \nsecurity clearance. His wife recently received a Master's Degree in Business and \nFinances and is seeking employment. Their combined monthly income from \nunemployment is $3,500, with approximately $3,250 in monthly expenses, leaving $250 \nmonthly in disposable income. (Tr. 52, 85-86, App. Ex. L, Budget, undated)  \n \nApplicant is highly regarded by his employer. His supervisor wrote that Applicant \nwas accurate and neat with his work product. He showed initiative and a good work \nethic. He works well with others because of his friendly demeanor. He is considered an \nasset to the job. He is highly motivated and continually asks for additional responsibility. \n(App. Ex. J, Letter, dated March 29, 2010) \n \nCredit reports (Gov. Ex. 4, Credit report, dated July 3, 2008, and Gov. Ex. 5, \nCredit report, dated August 31, 2009) show the following debts for Applicant: a \ncollection account for $3,666 (SOR 1.a); a cable company debt in collection for $255 \n(listed at both SOR 1.b and SOR 1.o); a debt in collection for $912 (SOR 1.c); a debt for \ntax service for $90 (SOR 1.d); three medical accounts in collection by the same creditor \n\n \n3 \n \n \nfor $332 (listed at both SOR 1.e and 1.q), for $134 (SOR 1.p), and $903 (SOR 1.u); a \ncollection account for a loan for $801 (SOR 1.f); a collection account for $1,629 (SOR \n1.g); a collection account on a loan for $1,069 (SOR 1.h); two credit card debts in \ncollection to the same credit card company for $11,553 (SOR 1.i), and $4,564 (SOR \n1.j); a collection account on a telephone debt for $378 (SOR 1.k); a cable debt in \ncollection for $264 (SOR 1.l); three medical debts in collection to the same creditor for \n$394 (SOR 1.m), $489 (SOR 1.n), and $373 (SOR 1.v); an account in collection for \nleased furniture and appliances for $3.051 (SOR 1.r); a pay day loan in collection for \n$462 (SOR 1.s); a telephone company debt in collection for $1,405 (SOR 1.t); and a \nmilitary exchange credit card past due more than 120 days for $2,029 (SOR 1.w). \nApplicant is also charged with uttering a fraudulent check for an amount under $500. He \nwas found guilty and fined $204. (SOR 1.x) The balance owed is approximately \n$35,512. (App. Ex. A, Debt Plan, undated) \n \nApplicant lived with a girlfriend for approximately nine years from 1995 until 2003. \nDuring this time, he purchased or leased items like furniture and appliances for her that \nhe could not afford. By sometime in 2001, Applicant admitted he was living beyond his \nmeans. He was using credit cards to make every day purchases and items requested \nby his girlfriend. He tried working overtime to get more funds, but he still spent beyond \nhis means. He and his girlfriend had agreed to share expenses, but Applicant was \npaying the majority of their bills. In late 2003, Applicant's girlfriend left and took the \nleased furniture and appliances with her. He was left with the debts they had \naccumulated. (Tr. 32-36) \n \nApplicant continued to work at various electronic technician positions, and on \ntemporary duty overseas and in the United States. He married in July 2004, but he and \nhis wife lived at separate locations while he finished a few jobs. He moved to his wife's \nlocation in December 2004, and started looking for work in his field. He was \nunemployed from December 2004 until he found employment again in November 2005. \nHe drew unemployment during this time. He and his wife had sufficient income for their \npresent living expenses. Applicant was employed by a company as an electronics \ntechnician from November 2005 until December 2006. He worked for another company \nfor about a year from December 2006 until June 2007 and part of his job required \nextensive travel. He was paid per diem by the company to cover his travel expenses. \nHowever, the company was late in paying the per diem causing Applicant to accumulate \nadditional delinquent debts. Then, Applicant worked for a series of companies from \nJune 2007 until December 2007, sometimes at less salary than he was paid by his \nprevious employer. He left the companies as contracts and jobs were completed and \nthe work terminated. He did not travel or receive per diem in most of these other \npositions thus lowering his cash input. Since he was underemployed or unemployed, \nApplicant did not have the funds to pay his past due obligations. (Tr. 36-40) \n \nApplicant and his wife moved to their present location in 2007 because Applicant \nknew he could find good employment and a good salary in that location. He was \nunemployed, but drew unemployment funds, from December 2007 until June 2008, \nwhen he started working for his present employer. Even with his present employer, \n\n \n4 \n \n \nthere were periods of unemployment as contracts were finished or lost. During the time \nhe was not working, he was drawing unemployment. After moving to their present \nlocation, Applicant and his wife changed their life style to match their income. They \nstopped using credit cards, paid off and sold one of their cars, modified the loan on his \nremaining car, and established a budget permitting payment of present debts and past \ndue obligations. They have managed to stay within budget and still pay off some of \nApplicant's past due obligations. Applicant is now receiving a monthly credit report and \nhas a credit watch request with the credit reporting agency. Applicant has paid seven of \nthe delinquent debts, and is making paying on two of the debts. He successfully \ndisputed 12 of the debts as not his debts, and they have been removed from his credit \nreport. He made restitution for a fraudulent check and paid a court fine. He has four \ndebts remaining to be paid, including the two he is presently paying. Applicant paid or \nresolved $20,757 of debt, with $14,754 still to be paid (Tr. 44-52; App. Ex. A, financial \nsummary, undated; App. Ex. I, Loan Modification, dated March 5, 2010; App. Ex. K, \nCredit Report Request, dated March 9, 2010; App. Ex. N, Credit Watch Request, dated \nMarch 25, 2010)   \n \nApplicant disputed the debt at SOR 1.a, and it was resolved in his favor as a \nfraudulent entry by the credit reporting agency. (Tr. 52; Answer to SOR, Letter, dated \nNovember 12, 2009, and Letter, dated January 27, 2010; App. Ex. B, Letter, dated April \n5, 2010) Applicant disputed the debt listed at both SOR 1.b and SOR 1.o as not his debt \nsince it listed the debt belonging to someone with a different social security number. \nThe dispute was resolved in his favor and the debt has been removed from his credit \nreport. (Tr. 52-53, 68-72; Answer to SOR, Letter, dated November 10, 2009; App. Ex. C, \nLetter, date January 10. 2010) \n \nApplicant has been making payments on the debt listed at SOR 1.c. The amount \nof the debt has been reduced by half and is now only $450. (Tr. 54-55; Answer to SOR, \nWestern Union Receipts, dated November 13, 2009, and November 16, 2009) Applicant \npaid in full the debt at SOR 1.d for tax service. Tr. 55-56; Answer to SOR, Note, dated \nJuly 6, 2009)  \n \nApplicant disputed the $134 medical debt for a hospital listed at both SOR 1.e \nand SOR 1.p, the $394 medical debt at SOR 1.m, the $489 medical debt at SOR 1.n, \nthe $332 medical debt at SOR 1.q, and the $903 medical debt at SOR 1.u. He also \ndisputed the medical debt at SOR 1.v for the services of the emergency physicians at \nthe hospital. The bills all arose from emergency treatment of Applicant. He had health \ninsurance when he was treated. The bills should have been paid by the insurance \ncompany. The creditor acknowledged the debts were listed in error and they have been \nremoved from Applicant's credit report. (Tr. 56-58, 72-74; App. Ex. D, Letter, dated April \n5, 2010; App. Ex. F, Receipt, dated April 6, 2010; Answer to SOR, Hospital Letter, \nundated, Med Data Letter, dated February 5, 2010) \n \nThe delinquent credit card debt at SOR 1.f has been paid in full. (Tr. 58; Answer \nto SOR, Collection Agency Letter, dated November 11, 2009) Applicant disputed the \ndebt listed at SOR 1.g. The dispute was resolved in Applicant's favor, and removed from \n\n \n5 \n \n \nhis credit report. (Tr. 59; Answer to SOR, Letters, dated January 8, 2010, October 14, \n2009, and September 22, 2009) The delinquent debt at SOR 1.h is for a loan Applicant \nused to assist his mother. The debt has been paid in full (Tr. 59-60; Answer to SOR, \nLetter, dated October 13, 2009) \n \nThe delinquent debts at SOR 1.i for $11,553 and SOR 1.j for $4,564 are for the \nsame credit card company for Applicant's expense accounts with two of his previous \nemployers. He used the accounts to buy items for his job as well as for personal \npurchases. He was authorized to use the cards for non-business items. Applicant has \nreached a settlement with the credit card company, but does not have the funds to \nmake the payment. He is trying to arrange a payment plan with the creditor. (Tr. 60-64; \nAnswer to SOR, Letter, dated January 11, 2010) \n \nApplicant paid in full the delinquent phone debt at SOR 1.k. (Tr. 64-65; Answer to \nSOR. Letter, dated November 9, 2009) Applicant paid in full the delinquent cable \ncompany debt at SOR 1.l. (Tr. 65-68; Answer to SOR, Letter, dated June 30, 2006) \nApplicant settled the debt for leased furniture and appliances at SOR 1.r for $400, and it \nhas been paid. (Tr. 74; Answer to SOR, Letter, dated November 12, 2009; App. Ex. E, \nLetter, dated January 22, 2010) Applicant settled the pay day loan debt at SOR 1.s for \n$623 and it has been paid. (Tr. 74-75; Answer to SOR, Letter, dated November 11, \n2009) Applicant is making monthly payments as agreed on his military exchange credit \ncard listed at SOR 1.w. (Tr. 76-77; App Ex. G, letter, dated March 30, 2010)  \n \nApplicant disputed and resolved in his favor the telephone debt at SOR 1.t, and it \nhas been deleted from his credit report. (Tr. 75-76; Answer to SOR, Letter, dated \nNovember 13, 2009) Applicant believed he had sufficient funds in his account when he \nwrote a check shortly after moving with his wife to his present location as listed at SOR \n1.x. He paid restitution for the check and paid the resulting fine. (Tr. 21, App. Ex. H, \nCheck and Receipt, dated August 4, 2006) \n \nIn summary, Applicant has either paid, is paying, or disputed and resolved the \ndisputes on all but four of his delinquent debts. He is making regular payments on the \ndebt at SOR 1.c, and the military credit card at SOR 1.w. He still has debts outstanding \nto a credit card company as listed at SOR 1.j and 1.t. Applicant's wife testified that she \nhas a Master's Degree in Business and Finances. She has been counseling Applicant \non proper financial management. After they married, she started Applicant on a family \nbudget, and used a budget spreadsheet to manage their finances. She assisted \nApplicant in controlling his finances and reducing his debt levels. With her help, \nApplicant paid over half of his delinquent debt total. They developed a plan to pay the \nremaining debts, so they have established a sense of financial responsibility. Their plan \nis to continue to pay off the debts at SOR 1.c and SOR 1.w, and anticipate paying them \noff by the end of 2010. There are settlement offers on the two remaining credit card \ndebts that expire shortly. Applicant's wife is seeking an extension of the settlement \noffers. As soon as Applicant is again employed and can contribute to the family income, \nthey will start to pay these debts. They intend to pay the debts on a monthly basis until \nresolved. (Tr. 85-93) \n\n \n6 \n \n \nPolicies \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which must be considered in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n \nAnalysis \n \nFinancial Considerations: \n \n \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by \nrules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, \n\n \n7 \n \n \ntrustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information. An individual who is \nfinancially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \n(AG \u00b6 18) Similarly, an individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or careless in their obligations to protect classified \ninformation. Behaving responsibly or irresponsibly in one aspect of life provides an \nindication of how a person may behave in other aspects of life.  \n \n \nA person\u2019s relationship with his creditors is a private matter until evidence is \nuncovered demonstrating an inability or unwillingness to repay debts under agreed \nterms. Absent evidence of strong extenuating or mitigating circumstances, an applicant \nwith a history of serious or recurring financial difficulties is in a situation of risk \ninconsistent with the holding of a security clearance. An applicant is not required to be \ndebt free, but is required to manage his finances in such a way as to meet his financial \nobligations. Applicant admits he incurred delinquent debts because he lived beyond his \nmeans and purchased items he did not have sufficient resources to fund. The \ndelinquent debts listed in credit reports for Applicant are a security concern raising \nFinancial Consideration Disqualifying Conditions (FC DC) AG \u00b6 19(a) (inability or \nunwillingness to satisfy debts), FC DC AG \u00b6 19(c) (a history of not meeting financial \nobligations), and FC DC AG \u00b6 19(e) (consistent spending beyond one's means, which \nmay be indicted by excessive indebtedness, significant negative cash flow, high debt-to-\nincome ratio, and/or other financial analysis).  \n \n \nI considered Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions (FC MC) AG \u00b6 20(a) \n(the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment), and FC MC AG \u00b6 20(b) (the \nconditions that resulted in the financial problems were largely beyond the person\u2019s \ncontrol (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical \nemergency, or a death, divorce, or separation), and the individual acted responsibly \nunder the circumstances). These mitigating conditions partially apply. Applicant incurred \ndelinquent debts because he lived beyond his means and purchased items to please his \ngirlfriend. His debts were not incurred under unusual circumstances that were beyond \nhis control. They were incurred through immaturity and irresponsible financial actions. \nBut for the influence that his wife now exerts on his finances, Applicant's debts could \nrecur. The only credit Applicant can receive under these mitigating conditions is that he \nis now acting responsibly towards his finances. He has paid or resolved a majority of his \ndelinquent debts. Since his debts are being paid or resolved, his present finances do \nnot cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.  \n \n \nI considered FC MC AG \u00b6 20(c) (the person has received or is receiving \ncounseling for the problem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control). The mitigating condition applies. Applicant's wife, who has \na Master's Degree in Business and Finance, has been counseling Applicant on proper \nfinancial management and taken control of his finances. Under her influence, there are \nclear indications his debts are either paid or being paid. \n \n\n \n8 \n \n \nI considered FC MC AG \u00b6 20(d) (the individual has initiated a good-faith effort to \nrepay the overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts). For FC MC \u00b6 AG 20(d) to \napply, there must be an \u201cability\u201d to repay the debts, the \u201cdesire\u201d to repay, and \u201cevidence\u201d \nof a good-faith effort to repay. A systematic, concrete method of handling debts is \nneeded. Applicant presented information to show that seven of the delinquent debts \nhave been paid, and his is paying on two other debts which should be paid by the end \nof 2010. He also presented information to show that he successfully disputed 12 of the \ndebts and they have been removed from his credit reports. He redeemed by restitution \na fraudulent check and paid a court imposed fine. He has two remaining debts and has \nsettlement offers on these debts. He has a plan to seek an extension of the settlement \noffers and each a payment plan with the creditor. Applicant's actions to contact his \ncreditors, pay or dispute debts, and enter payment plans are good-faith efforts to repay \nhis creditors or resolve his debts. The mitigating condition applies. \n \nI considered FC MC AG \u00b6 20(e) (the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute \nthe legitimacy of the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of \nactions to resolve the issue). Applicant disputed 12 of the delinquent debts, many of \nthem medical debts, and provided documented evidence that the disputes were \nresolved in his favor, and the debts removed from his credit report.  \n \nWhole-Person Analysis  \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s security eligibility by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all \nthe circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative \nprocess factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent \nto which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the \nmotivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, \nexploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant a security clearance \nmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nguidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I considered that Applicant is \nconsidered a good employee by his supervisor. Applicant must establish a \"meaningful \ntrack record\" of debt payment, including evidence of actual debt reduction through \n\n \n9 \n \n \npayment of debts. He is not required, as a matter of law, to establish that he paid each \ndebt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that he has a plan to resolve his financial \nproblems and takes significant action to implement that plan. The entirety of his financial \nsituation and his actions can reasonably be considered in evaluating the extent to which \nhis actions to reduce his outstanding indebtedness is credible and realistic. There is no \nrequirement that a plan provide for payments on all outstanding debts simultaneously. \nRather, a reasonable plan and concomitant conduct may provide for the payment of \nsuch debts one at a time.   \n \nApplicant established a \"meaningful track record\" of debt payment, including \nevidence of actual debt reduction through payment of debts. Applicant presented \nsufficient information to show he is taking reasonable and responsible action to resolve \nhis financial issues. He paid seven of the delinquent debts, and disputed and resolved \n12 more of the debts. He resolved and paid a fraudulent check. He is paying two other \ndebts according to agreed plans. These two debts will be paid in full by the end of 2010. \nHe has settlement offers on his two remaining debts and will start to pay them when he \nreturns to employment with his employer. Applicant's management of his finances and \npast obligations indicates he will be concerned, responsible, and careful regarding \nclassified information. Applicant mitigated security concerns based on his finances. \nOverall, on balance the record evidence leaves me without questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has mitigated the security concerns arising from financial \nconsiderations.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.x:  \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n \n_________________ \nTHOMAS M. CREAN \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Cervi, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nHENRY, Mary E., Administrative Judge:\nBased upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I  deny\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nApplicant executed and signed his Security Clearance Application (SF 86) on\nNovember 1, 2008. The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued\nApplicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under Guideline F\non August 20, 2009. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative\nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective\nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \nMarch 9, 2010\n\nBrief, Department Counsel, footnote 1, p.2.\n1\nItem 5; Item 6.\n2\nItem 6.\n3\nId.\n4\n2\nApplicant received the SOR and submitted a notarized, written response to the\nSOR allegations on September 3, 2009. He requested a decision on the written record\nin lieu of a hearing. \nDepartment Counsel prepared a File of Relevant Material (FORM) and mailed\nApplicant a complete copy on October 19, 2009. Applicant received the FORM on\nNovember 10, 2009. He had 30 days from receipt of the FORM to file objections and\nsubmit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation. He did not submit a response or\nadditional evidence. DOHA assigned this case to me on March 5, 2010. The\ngovernment submitted nine exhibits, which have been marked as Item 1-9 and admitted\ninto the record. Applicant\u2019s response to the SOR is Item 4.\nFindings of Fact\nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the factual allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a,\n1.b, and 1.c of the SOR, with explanations. He did not provide additional information to\nsupport his request for eligibility for a security clearance. \nApplicant, who is 58 years old, worked as a program manager for a Department\nof Defense contractor. He does not currently work, as his employer laid him off in May\n2009. His employer is still sponsoring him for a security clearance, because he is\neligible for rehire.  Applicant enlisted in the United States Army in 1971. He retired from\n1\nthe Army in 2000 at the rank of Chief Warrant Officer after serving 20 years on active\nduty and seven years as an active reservist. He receives a military retirement and\nveteran\u2019s disability benefits.2\nApplicant has been married several times. He is currently single, but living with\nhis last wife. He has two adult children and a stepchild.  \n3\nIn addition to his current unemployment, Applicant did not work between April\n2008 and October 2008, and August 2001 and November 2001. Applicant\u2019s current\nfinancial problems began when he and his last wife separated in 2006 and divorced in\n2007. During this marriage, he and his wife accumulated debt, including significant\ncredit card debt to pay for many items, including vacations. When they divorced, he\nassumed responsibility for all their credit card debt and mortgage.4\nIn the last few years, Applicant paid a number of credit card debts, using an\nequity line of credit and other credit cards. He then closed the paid accounts. After his\ndivorce, Applicant lacked sufficient funds to pay his mortgage, line of credit, and credit\n\nId.\n5\nItem 2; Item 6.\n6\nItem 6.\n7\nItem 2; Item 6.\n8\n3\ncard bills. He could not make the regular monthly payments on his debts. Instead, he\npaid these debts periodically. In August 2007, he placed his house for sale, but he was\nunable to sell the house immediately. In early 2008, the mortgagor began foreclosure\nproceedings. Before these proceedings concluded, an investor offered to pay Applicant\n$1,000 for his house and to assume the mortgage. Applicant accepted this offer and\nsigned the deed over to the investor. He does not have any debts related to the\nmortgage.5\nApplicant currently owes $27,000 on one credit card (card 1), $10,000 on a\nsecond credit card (card 2), and $35,000 on an equity line of credit (line of credit). He\ncontacted the card 1 creditor to develop a repayment plan. The card 1 creditor\nrequested a payment of $7,000 and a high monthly payment. Applicant could not pay\nthe money requested or meet the monthly payment. In November 2008, the card 2\ncreditor offered to settle Applicant\u2019s debt in exchange for one $4,500 payment.\nApplicant could not pay this amount in one payment. The card 2 creditor has declined to\nwork with Applicant on a payment plan. Applicant provided no information on his efforts\nto repay the line of credit.6\nApplicant contacted a debt settlement company in February 2008, which offered\nto negotiate a settlement with each of his creditors for less than he owed. Initially, he did\nnot retain this company\u2019s services, but changed his mind. He retained the services of\nthis company for six months. He terminated the company\u2019s services after credit\ncompanies contacted him, offering settlements lower that the debt counseling service\nintended to negotiate on his behalf.  \n7\nThe debts listed in the SOR remain unpaid. Applicant plans to save his money to\npay his debts when he returns to work. His current monthly income is $2,228 from his\nmilitary retirement and disability income. His monthly expenses, including other debt\npayment, total approximately $2,300 a month. His former spouse currently lives with\nhim, but her income is not mentioned. He did indicate she was willing to help pay his\ndebts, but did not explain how much she would contribute to the resolution of these\ndebts. During his meeting with the investigator and in his response to the SOR, he\nindicated that he would save money to pay these debts. Both times he made this\nstatement, he was not working.8\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\n\n4\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in\nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based\non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d An\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion for obtaining a favorable security\ndecision.\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship\ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government\nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk\nan applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified\ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation\nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n\n5\nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set\nout in AG & 18:      \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nAG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.\nSimilarly under AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise\nsecurity concerns. Applicant accumulated significant debt during his last marriage. He\nhas been unable to pay some obligations for a period of time. The evidence is sufficient\nto raise these potentially disqualifying conditions.\nIn assessing whether an Applicant has established mitigation under Guideline F,\nthe Appeal Board provided the following guidance in ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 3\n(App. Bd. May 21, 2008):\nIn evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the\nconcept of \u201c\u2018meaningful track record\u2019 necessarily includes evidence of\nactual debt reduction through payment of debts.\u201d See, e.g., ISCR Case\nNo. 05-01920 at 5 (App. Bd. Mar. 1, 200). However, an applicant is not\nrequired, as a matter of law, to establish that he has paid off each and\nevery debt listed in the SOR. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 02-25499 at 2\n(App. Bd. Jun. 5, 2006). All that is required is that an applicant\ndemonstrate that he has \u201c. . . established a plan to resolve his financial\nproblems and taken significant actions to implement that plan.\u201d See, e.g.,\nISCR Case No. 04-09684 at 2 (App. Bd. Jul. 6, 2006). The Judge can\nreasonably consider the entirety of an applicant\u2019s financial situation and\nhis actions in evaluating the extent to which that applicant\u2019s plan for the\nreduction of his outstanding indebtedness is credible and realistic. See\nDirective \u00b6 E2.2(a) (\u201cAvailable, reliable information about the person, past\nand present, favorable and unfavorable, should be considered in reaching\na determination.\u201d) There is no requirement that a plan provide for\npayments on all outstanding debts simultaneously. Rather, a reasonable\nplan (and concomitant conduct) may provide for the payment of such\ndebts one at a time. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-25584 at 4 (App. Bd.\nApr. 4, 2008). Likewise, there is no requirement that the first debts actually\n\nAG \u00b6\u00b6 20(e) and 20(f) are not relevant in this case.\n9\n6\npaid in furtherance of a reasonable debt plan be the ones listed in the SOR.\nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security\nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG \u00b6 20(a), mitigation may occur when\nAthe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such\ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual=s\ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ Applicant=s financial worries\noccurred within the last five or six years. His debts are the result of overspending, not\nunusual circumstances. Because his debts are ongoing, they are recent. This mitigating\ncondition does not apply. \nUnder AG & 20(b), it may be mitigating where Athe conditions that resulted in the\nfinancial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a\nbusiness downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation),\nand the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.@ While Applicant\u2019s\nfinancial problems arose during his marriage, his problems became severe when he\nand his wife separated and divorced, and he assumed responsibility for all their\nhousehold debt after their divorce. He lacked sufficient income to pay all their debts.\nSince his divorce in 2007, Applicant has experienced two periods of unemployment,\nwith his last unemployment beginning in May 2009 and continuing. In 2006 and 2007,\nApplicant resolved many outstanding debts. However, he resolved credit card debt\nthrough the use of other credit cards and an equity line of credit. These resolved\naccounts are closed, and thus, not in use. However, he has not resolved the large debts\ncreated by his use of credit to pay other credit debts. I find this mitigating condition\npartially applicable. \nEvidence that Athe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control@\nis potentially mitigating under AG & 20(c). Similarly, AG & 20(d) applies where the\nevidence shows Athe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or\notherwise resolve debts.@ Although Applicant did not receive financial counseling, he did\ncontact a debt resolution company. He retained the services of this company for six\nmonths. However, the company did not pay any debts on his behalf. Applicant\u2019s debts\nremain unresolved. Applicant pays his current expenses, but lacks sufficient income to\npay his old debts. AG \u00b6 20(c) is partially applicable, but AG \u00b6 20(d) does not apply as\nthere is no evidence of a good faith resolution of his debts.9\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of an applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the\nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):\n\n7\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole person concept. The decision to grant or deny a security\nclearance requires a careful weighing of all relevant factors, both favorable and\nunfavorable. In so doing, an administrative judge must review all the evidence of record,\nnot a single item in isolation, to determine if a security concern is established and then\nwhether it is mitigated. A determination of an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security\nclearance should not be made as punishment for specific past conduct, but on a\nreasonable and careful evaluation of all the evidence of record to decide if a nexus\nexists between established facts and a legitimate security concern. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant served in the military for\nmore than 25 years. With his retirement and disability income, he pays his usual\nmonthly expenses and several debts. This income does not provide him with sufficient\nmoney to pay the debts listed in the SOR or to save money to pay these large debts.\nApplicant\u2019s future intentions to pay his debts, while laudable, are insufficient to establish\nmitigation of the security concerns raised by his debts. Applicant has been unemployed\nfor much of the last two years. Again, because he is not working, he cannot pay his old\nand substantial debts. Applicant\u2019s unpaid debts remain a security concern.\nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I\nconclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns arising from his finances\nunder Guideline F.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\n\n8\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.

Applicant has a history\nof financial problems, which are ongoing. That history includes a Chapter 7 bankruptcy\ncase in 2001, and more recently delinquent accounts, repossession of a vehicle, and\nforeclosure upon a rental property. Applicant failed to present sufficient evidence to\novercome the security concerns raised by her history of financial problems.\nAccordingly, as explained below, this case is decided against Applicant.\nNovember 24, 2010\n\n  This case is adjudicated under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry,\n1\nsigned by President Eisenhower on February 20, 1960, as amended, as well as DoD Directive 5220.6,\nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program, dated January 2, 1992, as amended\n(Directive). In addition, the Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified\nInformation (AG), effective within the Defense Department on September 1, 2006, apply to this case. The AG\nwere published in the Federal Register and codified in 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 154, Appendix H (2006). The AG replace\nthe guidelines in Enclosure 2 to the Directive.    \n Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.7. \n2\n The file of relevant material consists of Department Counsel\u2019s written brief and supporting documents, some\n3\nof which are identified as exhibits in this decision.  \n Exhibit 4. \n4\n2\nStatement of the Case\nActing under the relevant Executive Order and DoD Directive,  on August 10,\n1\n2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (the Agency) issued a statement of\nreasons (SOR) explaining it was unable to find it is clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant Applicant access to classified information. The SOR is similar to a\ncomplaint, and it detailed the factual basis for the action under the security guideline\nknown as Guideline F for financial considerations. The SOR also recommended that the\ncase be submitted to an administrative judge to decide whether to deny or revoke\nApplicant\u2019s security clearance. \nApplicant answered the SOR in a timely fashion. Neither Applicant nor\nDepartment Counsel requested a hearing, and so, the case will be decided on the\nwritten record.2\nOn or about September 1, 2010, the Agency submitted its written case consisting\nof all relevant and material information that could be adduced at a hearing.  This so-\n3\ncalled file of relevant material (FORM) was mailed to Applicant and received by her on\nSeptember 16, 2010. She then had a 30-day period to submit a response setting forth\nobjections, rebuttal, extenuation, mitigation, or explanation. To date, she has not\nreplied. The case was assigned to me November 8, 2010. \nFindings of Fact\nBased on the record evidence as a whole, the following facts are established by\nsubstantial evidence. \nApplicant is a 54-year-old employee of a federal contractor, and she completed a\nsecurity clearance application in November 2008.  In the application, she reported\n4\nworking for the same company in various capacities since 1980 except for the period\nNovember 2000 to May 2002, when she was laid off. She is currently working as a\nquality control inspector. She was unemployed for a month after the job layoff in 2000.\nShe then worked as a sales clerk at a department store from December 2000 to August\n\n Exhibit 9. \n5\n Answer to SOR. \n6\n Exhibits 7, 8, and 9. \n7\n Answer to SOR. \n8\n Exhibit 9. \n9\n3\n2001, and as an administrative assistant for a local police department from August 2001\nto May 2002, when she was recalled by her current employer. Her employment history\nalso includes working as a part-time aerobic instructor or fitness trainer since 1990.\nApplicant has married and divorced twice, and she is currently living with a man\nin a spouse-like relationship. She has two children, daughters, born in 1986 and 1989,\nboth of whom live with Applicant. In addition to her two adult children, a granddaughter,\nborn in 2008, lives with Applicant. The 21-year-old son of her partner also lives in the\nhousehold. Applicant\u2019s father is deceased, but her mother lives nearby. \nApplicant has a history of financial problems that began shortly after her job\nlayoff in 2000. As a result, Applicant was unable to meet her financial obligations and\nsought relief via a Chapter 7 bankruptcy case, which is alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a. The case\nwas filed in about September 2001, and the court granted Applicant a discharge in\nbankruptcy in January 2002.  The record is silent concerning the number of creditors,\n5\nthe estimated assets, and the estimated liabilities in the bankruptcy case. Applicant\nattributes the bankruptcy to the job layoff and the resulting 18-month period of\nunemployment and underemployment.  \n6\nIn addition to the Chapter 7 bankruptcy case, Applicant reported more recent\nfinancial problems in her 2008 security clearance application as follows: (1) foreclosure\nupon a rental property; (2) repossession of two vehicles; (3) a delinquent credit card\naccount charged off as a bad debt; and (4) a delinquent utility account on the rental\nproperty. These debts, all of which are alleged in the SOR, are addressed below.\nIn response to SOR \u00b6 1.b, Applicant admits a $1,116 collection account that\nbegan as a credit card or charge account with a large store. She fell behind on the\naccount in 2007, and the account was charged off and then placed for collection with\nthe current creditor.  Applicant reports that she contacted the creditor and was\n7\nnegotiating the matter.  Applicant did not present any documentation on this debt. \n8\nIn response to SOR \u00b6 1.c, Applicant admits that a rental property, purchased in\n2003, was subject to foreclosure. She reports that she fell behind on the mortgage loan\npayments in 2007, when her tenants stopped paying monthly rent and she was unable\nto keep up with the payment. A 2008 credit report describes the loan as 180 days past\ndue in the amount of $8,219 with a balance of $54,283.  A 2009 credit report shows the\n9\n\n Exhibit 8. \n10\n Exhibit 7. \n11\n Answer to SOR. \n12\n Exhibits 7, 8, and 9. \n13\n Exhibits 8 and 9. \n14\n Exhibit 7. \n15\n Exhibit 7 and 9. \n16\n Exhibit 6. \n17\n4\nloan was past due in the amount of $11,155.  And a 2010 credit report indicates the\n10\nloan was past due in the amount of $19,000 and in foreclosure.  Applicant reports that\n11\nthe home was sold via foreclosure in August 2009, and she is waiting to hear if she\nowes a deficiency balance.  Applicant did not present any documentation on this debt. \n12\n \nIn response to SOR \u00b6 1.d, Applicant denies indebtedness stemming from\nrepossession of a vehicle. Applicant reports that this debt resulted from her partner\u2019s\npurchase of a truck for his son who then failed to make the loan payments. She denies\nthat she cosigned for the loan, although her partner did so. Although this account\nappears on Applicant\u2019s credit reports as a repossession, all three credit reports show a\nzero balance as well as a zero past-due balance on the account.  Applicant did not\n13\npresent any documentation on this debt.\nIn response to SOR \u00b6 1.e, Applicant admits indebtedness of $9,429 stemming\nfrom repossession of a vehicle. Applicant reports this debt resulted from her cosigning a\nloan with her daughter who then failed to make the loan payments when she was\nunable to work due to pregnancy. The 2008 and 2009 credit reports describe this debt\nas a repossession or charged-off account in the amount of $9,429.  The 2010 credit\n14\nreport shows the debt was transferred or sold to another creditor.  Applicant did not\n15\npresent any documentation on this debt. \nIn response to SOR \u00b6 1.f, Applicant admits indebtedness of $329 stemming from\na utility bill for her rental property. Applicant reports that she contacted the utility and\noffered to make weekly payments of $25, but the utility could not locate the account.\nBoth the 2008 and 2010 credit reports describe it as a charged-off account.  Applicant\n16\ndid not present any documentation on this debt. \nApplicant reports that her current financial problems stem from circumstances\nbeyond her control.  She reports that her mother became ill and she had to assume\n17\nresponsibility for her mother\u2019s care and expenses. And about the same time, her\ndaughter became pregnant and was unable to work, resulting in Applicant covering her\ndaughter\u2019s expenses as well. \n\n Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988) (\u201cit should be obvious that no one has a \u2018right\u2019 to\n18\na security clearance\u201d); Duane v. Department of Defense, 275 F.3d 988, 994 (10  Cir. 2002) (no right to a\nth\nsecurity clearance).\n 484 U.S. at 531.\n19\n Directive, \u00b6 3.2. \n20\n Directive, \u00b6 3.2. \n21\n ISCR Case No. 02-18663 (App. Bd. Mar. 23, 2004).\n22\n Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.14.\n23\n5\nApplicant did not reply to the FORM. Likewise, the record is silent concerning\nApplicant\u2019s good employment record or constructive community involvement. The\nrecord is also silent concerning Applicant\u2019s overall financial situation; for example, her\ncurrent income, her financial assets (checking or savings accounts, investment\naccounts, etc.), and her ability to repay any of the indebtedness addressed above along\nwith her current financial obligations. \nLaw and Policies\nThis section sets forth the general principles of law and policies that apply to an\nindustrial security clearance case. The only purpose of a clearance decision is to decide\nif an applicant is suitable for access to classified information. The Department of\nDefense takes the handling and safeguarding of classified information seriously\nbecause it affects our national security, the lives of our servicemembers, and our\noperations abroad. \nIt is well-established law that no one has a right to a security clearance.  As\n18\nnoted by the Supreme Court in Department of Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe clearly consistent\nstandard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the\nside of denials.\u201d  Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive, any doubt\n19\nabout whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified information will be\nresolved in favor of protecting national security.  \nA favorable clearance decision establishes eligibility of an applicant to be granted\na security clearance for access to confidential, secret, or top-secret information.  An\n20\nunfavorable decision (1) denies any application, (2) revokes any existing security\nclearance, and (3) prevents access to classified information at any level.  \n21\nThere is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for\naccess to classified information.  The Government has the burden of presenting\n22\nevidence to establish facts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted.  An\n23\napplicant is responsible for presenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate\n\n Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n24\n Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n25\n Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n26\n ISCR Case No. 01-20700 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002) (citations omitted).\n27\n Executive Order 10865, \u00a7 7.\n28\n AG \u00b6\u00b6 18, 19, and 20 (setting forth the security concern and the disqualifying and mitigating conditions). \n29\n See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996) (It is well settled that \u201cthe security suitability of an\n30\napplicant is placed into question when that applicant is shown to have a history of excessive indebtedness\nor recurring financial difficulties.\u201d) (citation omitted). \n AG \u00b6 18.  \n31\n6\nfacts that have been admitted or proven.  In addition, an applicant has the ultimate\n24\nburden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.  In Egan, the Supreme\n25\nCourt stated that the burden of proof is less than a preponderance of the evidence.26\nThe DOHA Appeal Board has followed the Court\u2019s reasoning, and a judge\u2019s findings of\nfact are reviewed under the substantial-evidence standard.27\nThe AG set forth the relevant standards to consider when evaluating a person\u2019s\nsecurity clearance eligibility, including disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions\nfor each guideline. In addition, each clearance decision must be a commonsense\ndecision based upon consideration of the relevant and material information, the\npertinent criteria and adjudication factors, and the whole-person concept. \nThe Government must be able to have a high degree of trust and confidence in\nthose persons to whom it grants access to classified information. The decision to deny a\nperson a security clearance is not a determination of an applicant\u2019s loyalty.  Instead, it\n28\nis a determination that an applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President has\nestablished for granting eligibility for access.\nAnalysis\nUnder Guideline F for financial considerations,  the suitability of an applicant\n29\nmay be questioned or put into doubt when that applicant has a history of excessive\nindebtedness or financial problems or difficulties.  The overall concern under Guideline\n30\nF is that: \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to\nprotect classified information.  \n31\n\n AG \u00b6 19(a).  \n32\n AG \u00b6 19(c). \n33\n AG \u00b6 20 (a) \u2013 (f). \n34\n7\nSimilarly, an individual who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible,\nunconcerned, negligent, or careless in properly handling and safeguarding classified\ninformation within the defense industry. Indeed, the practice of evaluating a person\nbased on their record of financial responsibility (or lack thereof) is used in various\nindustries. For example, the insurance industry uses credit-based insurance scores\nwhen determining insurance rates because the scores have been found to be effective\nin predicting future losses.  \nThe evidence here, except for the repossession of her partner\u2019s son\u2019s truck and\nresulting indebtedness, supports a conclusion that Applicant has a history of financial\nproblems. That repossession is not fairly attributable to Applicant, and SOR \u00b6 1.d is\nresolved in her favor. Her history of financial problems raises security concerns because\nit indicates inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts  and a history of not meeting\n32\nfinancial obligations  within the meaning of Guideline F. The facts are sufficient to\n33\nestablish these two disqualifying conditions.  \nUnder Guideline F, there are six conditions that may mitigate security concerns:34\n20(a) The behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred\nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast\ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment;\n20(b) The conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely\nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business\ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or\nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;\n20(c) The person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is\nunder control;\n20(d) The individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors\nor otherwise resolve debts;\n20(e) The individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of\nthe past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides\ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides\nevidence of actions to resolve the issue; and \n\n AG \u00b6 2(a)(1) \u2013 (9).\n35\n8\n20(f) The affluence resulted from a legal source of income.\nOf those mitigating conditions, the most pertinent here are subparagraphs 20(a)\nand 20(b). It appears Applicant\u2019s financial problems were caused by unique\ncircumstances largely beyond her control\u2014the job layoff in 2000 and the nonpaying\ntenants in 2007. Both events led to major financial problems\u2014the bankruptcy and the\nforeclosure on the rental property. In addition, family circumstances placed a financial\nburden on Applicant. \nApplicant is required to act responsibly under the circumstances in order to\nreceive full credit in mitigation under subparagraph 20(b), and she has not met that\nrequirement. A responsible applicant would have made the effort to present\ndocumentation in support of her case. Applicant did not present any documentation\nshowing the current status of the debts in the SOR. Likewise, she did not present\ndocumentary proof of payment, in full or in part, of the debts. Applicant did not present\ndocumentary evidence of her ability to repay. And she failed to present a realistic plan\nof action to resolve the indebtedness. Lacking such a plan, as well as any measurable\nprogress in working the plan, the credit in mitigation is insufficient to mitigate the\nsecurity concerns. Indeed, had Applicant paid the two smallest debts (the $1,116\ncollection account and the $329 utility account) and presented documentation showing\nsome progress on the other two debts, I might have decided this case for her. But\nbased on this record, a favorable decision is not justified. At bottom, Applicant\u2019s ongoing\nfinancial problems raise doubts or questions about her judgment, reliability, and\ntrustworthiness.\nTo conclude, following Egan and the clearly-consistent standard, I resolve these\ndoubts in favor of protecting national security. In reaching this conclusion, I gave due\nconsideration to the whole-person concept.  Applicant did not meet her ultimate burden\n35\nof persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision. This case is decided against\nApplicant. \nFormal Findings\nThe formal findings on the SOR allegations are as follows:\nParagraph 1, Guideline H:\nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.a, 1.b, 1.c, 1.e, 1.f:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nFor Applicant\n\n9\nConclusion\nIn light of the record as a whole, it is not clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance.

In an attachment to his answer, Applicant explained he used marijuana about four times since 2005, not 1991 as indicated in the SOR. He stated, \u201cif my rare and infrequent use of marijuana is enough to prevent me from receiving a security clearance, then so be it\u201d (Item 4). Applicant is 40 years old. He has been married since July 2003. He has two children from a previous marriage, and one stepchild (Item 4). He received a Master\u2019s degree in Business Administration in December 1996. He has been employed by a defense contractor since February 1998. From April 1990 to April 1994, Applicant served in the United States Army as a linguist (Id.). Applicant admitted using marijuana in recent years. The problem with his history of marijuana use is that he provided three versions of use that differ in frequency and/or length of use. Applicant completed his security clearance questionnaire (SCA, Item 4) on November 6, 2008.

Goldstein,  Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro se \n______________\nDecision\n______________\nMASON, Paul J., Administrative Judge:\nBased upon a review of the case file, pleadings, and exhibits, Applicant\u2019s\neligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nStatement of the Case\nApplicant submitted his Security Clearance Application (SCA, Item 4), on\nNovember 6, 2008. On December 16, 2008, Applicant was interviewed by an\ninvestigator from the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) regarding his drug use. \nOn July 10, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under drug involvement\n(Guideline H). The action was taken pursuant to Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and adjudicative guidelines (AG)\npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and made effective within the\nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued on or after September 1, 2006.\nJanuary 29, 2010\n\n2\nApplicant requested a decision be made on the record in lieu of a hearing. A\ncopy of the government\u2019s File of Relevant Material (FORM, the government\u2019s evidence\nin support of the allegations of the SOR) was sent to Applicant on September 28, 2009.\nApplicant received the FORM on November 2, 2009. His response was due by\nDecember 2, 2009. No response was received by DOHA. The case file was assigned to\nme on January 11, 2010. \nFindings of Fact\nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, dated August 7, 2009, he admitted using\nmarijuana, but denied the factual allegation of marijuana use between 1991 and\nNovember 2008. Instead, he claimed that he was in the military with a security\nclearance until 1994, and he had to take regular drug tests. In an attachment to his\nanswer, Applicant explained he used marijuana about four times since 2005, not 1991\nas indicated in the SOR. He stated, \u201cif my rare and infrequent use of marijuana is\nenough to prevent me from receiving a security clearance, then so be it\u201d (Item 4).\nApplicant is 40 years old. He has been married since July 2003. He has two\nchildren from a previous marriage, and one stepchild (Item 4). He received a Master\u2019s\ndegree in Business Administration in December 1996. He has been employed by a\ndefense contractor since February 1998. From April 1990 to April 1994, Applicant\nserved in the United States Army as a linguist (Id.). \nApplicant admitted using marijuana in recent years. The problem with his history\nof marijuana use is that he provided three versions of use that differ in frequency and/or\nlength of use.\nApplicant completed his security clearance questionnaire (SCA, Item 4) on\nNovember 6, 2008. In response to the section 24 module (Your Use of Illegal Drugs and\nDrug Activity) of the SCA, he answered \u201cyes\u201d to question 24.a., that he used drugs since\nthe age of 16 or in the last 7 years (Id. at 28). On the next page of the SCA in the space\nprovided for \u201cAdditional Comments\u201d of the section 24 module, Applicant estimated he\nused marijuana four times from October 1991 to the present. At the conclusion of the\nsection, Applicant noted he used marijuana in the past at concerts and parties. He\nnever purchased or sold the drug. He never was a consistent smoker of marijuana, and\nestimated he used the drug about four times in seven years. If he used marijuana four\ntimes in the past seven years, the date he started using marijuana would be 2001, and\nnot 1991, as he indicated in the section. I find that he meant to enter the year \u201c2001,\"\nwhich begins the seven-year period of drug use he referred to in the \u201cAdditional\nComments\u201d area of the module. \nAppellant provided a different picture of his marijuana history when he was\ninterviewed in December 2008 by an investigator of the Office of Personnel\nManagement (OPM) (Item 5). In that interview, he stated that during two recreational\ntrips with approximately 10 to 20 friends in July 2007 and July 2008, lasting four days\neach, Applicant used marijuana. Each day for four days, he ingested four or five puffs\n\n3\nfrom a \u00bd joint of marijuana that was passed among the recreationists (Id.). Applicant\nrecalled using marijuana when he took five to seven puffs between 9:00 P.M. and 12:00\nA.M. at a concert on June 15, 2008. Applicant also remembered using marijuana on one\noccasion in 2005. \nLater in the same December 2008 interview, Applicant stated that he only\nsmoked marijuana during special events (Id.), and that he never purchased the drug. He\nstated he enjoyed smoking marijuana, but was not dependent (Id.). He stated he would\nsmoke the drug in the future in similar situations if provided freely to him. Applicant\nindicated he would stop using marijuana if that was a condition for receiving a security\nclearance or job (Id.). Applicant did not believe he could be blackmailed or coerced by\nhis marijuana use because his camping friends know about his marijuana use (Id.). \nCredibility Findings\nApplicant\u2019s differing explanations about the frequency and duration of his\nmarijuana use pose a credibility problem concerning which account to believe. I find that\nApplicant\u2019s account provided in the December 2008 OPM interview is the most\ncomplete and credible. Applicant\u2019s response to question 3. of Item 6 (interrogatory\nanswers) reflects that he had a full opportunity to read the December 2008 interview\nand make corrections. The corrections he added and observations he made about the\ninterview (in Item 6) substantiate my finding that he reviewed the December 2008\ninterview. \nWhen he received the FORM in November 2009, he had another opportunity to\nread his December 2008 interview a second time. In supplying no additional corrections\nto the December 2008 interview, I find he agreed with the history of marijuana use he\nfurnished to the investigator in December 2008. By indicating that he enjoyed using\nmarijuana and that he would likely use the drug in the future except if drug use\ninterferes with his chances of obtaining a security clearance or a job, I find Applicant\nreally does not want to end his marijuana use. \nCharacter Evidence\nApplicant provided no independent evidence regarding his job performance or\nreputation in the community where he lives. \nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in\nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. These guidelines\nare applied in conjunction with the variables listed in the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The\n\n4\nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person,\npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration.\nReasonable doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to classified\ninformation will be resolved in favor of national security. In reaching this decision, I have\ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence\ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere\nspeculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion for obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship\nis not restricted to normal duty hours. Rather, the relationship is an-around-the-clock\nresponsibility between an applicant and the federal government. The government\nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk\nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information.\nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to\npotential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.\nAnalysis\nDrug Involvement \nParagraph 24 of the Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) sets forth the security concern\nrelated to drug involvement:\nUse of an illegal drug or misuse of prescription drug can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because it may\nimpair judgment and because it raises questions about a person\u2019s ability\nor willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations.\nThe disqualifying conditions that apply are:\nAG \u00b6 25(a) (any drug abuse); and\nAG \u00b6 25(c) (illegal drug possession, including cultivation, processing,\nmanufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of drug\nparaphernalia); and\n\n5\nAG \u00b6 25(h) (expressed intent to continue illegal drug use, or failure to\nclearly and convincingly commit to discontinue drug use).\nApplicant admits using marijuana between 2005 and July 2008. He has\npresented three different accounts of drug use since he submitted his SCA in April\n2008. The most credible account comes from his interview with the OPM in December\n2008. He admitted using marijuana on one occasion in 2005, on four successive days in\nJuly 2007, on one occasion in June 2008, and on four successive days in July 2008.\nWhile he stated he had no intention of using the drug in the future, he described the\ncircumstances under which he would likely use marijuana in the future. His drug use\nfalls within the scope of AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a), 25(c), and 25(h).\nThere are two mitigators under AG \u00b6 26 that may apply:\nAG \u00b6 26(a) (the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or\nhappened under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not\ncast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment); and\nAG \u00b6 26.b (a demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future,\nsuch as: (1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts, (2)\nchanging or avoiding the environment where drugs are used, (3) an\nappropriate period of abstinence, and (4) a signed statement of intent with\nautomatic revocation of clearance for any violation). \nAG \u00b6 26(a) does not apply because Applicant\u2019s most recent drug use was less\nthan two years ago. Applicant, who enjoys using marijuana but does not feel dependent\non the drug, likes to attend special events, and will likely use marijuana if the drug is\ngiven to him during the event. Having described the circumstances in which he may use\nmarijuana in the future, I am not confident that Applicant will stop using marijuana under\nany conditions.\nApplicant smoked marijuana once in 2005. He also smoked the drug four times\nduring a four-day trip with friends in July 2007 and a four-day trip in 2008. He enjoys\nattending special events and concerts. He has presented no evidence to suggest he\nhas stopped associating with his drug using friends or frequenting environments where\ndrugs are used. While Applicant has indicated he has no intention of using marijuana in\nthe future, and will not use the drug if continued use jeopardizes his chances of\nreceiving a security clearance, Applicant has not convinced me that he is committed to\nforgo all future drug use. Finally, Applicant has not established an appropriate period of\nabstinence from drug use. AG \u00b6 26(b) does not apply. After weighing and balancing the\nentire record, Applicant has not met his burden of convincing me his drug involvement is\nno longer a security concern. \n\n6\nWhole Person Concept \nI have examined the evidence utilizing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions\nof the drug involvement guideline. Even though I have resolved the guideline against\nApplicant, the case still must be weighed within the context of nine variables known as\nthe whole person concept. In evaluating the relevance of an individual\u2019s conduct, the\nadministrative judge should consider the following factors: \nAG \u00b6 2(a) (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich the participation was voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and, (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nApplicant started using marijuana in 2005 when he was 35 years old. He used\nthe drug occasionally between 2005 and July 2008. Applicant likes to use marijuana and\nhe likes attending special events or concerts. He explained that he is likely to use the\ndrug at a concert in the future if it is given to him. Though marijuana use has been\ndecriminalized in the state where Applicant lives, the use of marijuana, except for\nmedical reasons, is still a crime in the state. Applicant has offered insufficient evidence\nto persuade me that he will stop using marijuana to obtain a security clearance.  \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1 (Drug Involvement, Guideline H):\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a.\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n                       \nPaul J. Mason\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nAlan V. Edmunds, Esq., Krystal M. Limon, Esq.\n\n1The Judge\u2019s favorable findings under Guideline E are not at issue in this appeal.  \n2\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On January 8, 2010, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of\nthe basis for that decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations)\nand Guideline E (Personal Conduct) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as\namended) (Directive).  Department Counsel requested a hearing.  On July 29, 2010, after the\nhearing, Administrative Judge Robert E. Coacher denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security\nclearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge denied Applicant due\nprocess; whether the Judge did not properly apply the pertinent mitigating factors; and whether the\nJudge did not properly apply the whole-person factors.1  Consistent with the following discussion,\nwe affirm the decision of the Judge.\nThe Judge made the following pertinent findings of fact: Applicant is employed by a Defense\ncontractor.  He has a Bachelor\u2019s degree in computer science.  In 2007 Applicant bought a house,\nfinancing the purchase with a $328,000 loan secured by a mortgage.  The loan was for 40 years and\nhas a 6.75% fixed interest rate.  His original monthly payments were $2,500.\nIn 2008 Applicant had trouble making his mortgage payments, which had increased by $250\na month due to an escrow adjustment.  He was also over-extended on a credit card.  During the\nSpring of 2008 he began skipping mortgage payments about every other month.  A few months later,\nhe entered into an agreement with a private company to assist him in seeking a loan modification.\nThis company was still engaging in negotiations with the lender at the close of the record.  Applicant\nhas not made a mortgage payment since April 2009, stating that the lender had told him to stop\npayments during negotiations.  He provided no evidence in corroboration.  At the close of the record,\nApplicant was $40,000 in arrears in his mortgage payments.\nApplicant has been employed in the same position since he bought the house.  He has not\nexperienced a diminution of pay, nor has he amassed other debts.  He has paid off a judgment\nagainst him for credit card debt, which was also alleged in the SOR.  He paid off two other debts that\nwere not alleged.  If his proposed loan modification is not approved, he will have to give up his\nhouse.  He has received no financial counseling, other than his arrangement with the company\nreferenced above.  He had sought a debt consolidation through his credit union, but his request was\ndenied.\nApplicant enjoys an excellent reputation at work for his professionalism, trustworthiness,\nand loyalty. \n\n3\nIn the Analysis portion of the decision, the Judge concluded that, under the circumstances\nof this case, Applicant\u2019s financial problems did not originate from circumstances outside his control.\nThe Judge acknowledged Applicant\u2019s efforts to obtain a loan modification.  However, he stated that\nApplicant\u2019s merely having enrolled in a loan modification program is not sufficient to demonstrate\na good-faith effort to pay debts.  He noted that this program had been ongoing since the summer of\n2008, with no demonstrated results as of the close of the record.  Indeed, the Judge also noted that,\ngiven Applicant\u2019s income and expenses, it is not clear that he would even be able to make payments\nunder a modified loan.  Furthermore, the Judge raised reasonable questions concerning the alleged\nadvice Applicant received from his lender to the effect that he should make no payments during\nnegotiations over loan modification, questions which Applicant\u2019s evidence did not answer.\nDue Process Issue  \nApplicant contends that the Judge denied him due process.  He argues that, in light of his pro\nse status at the hearing, he was not aware of the kind of evidence that would have benefitted his case\nfor mitigation.  He argues that the Judge should have given him more time after the hearing to\npresent corroborating evidence concerning his loan modification.     \n  However, the record demonstrates that the Judge did hold the record open for two weeks\nfollowing the May 27, 2010, hearing to enable Applicant to submit additional evidence concerning,\namong other things, the loan modification.  The Judge specifically stated that Applicant could, if he\nchose, present something in writing from the lender regarding Applicant\u2019s claim that he was told not\nto make mortgage payments during negotiations.  Tr. at 128-129.  Applicant subsequently presented\nadditional documents.  However, he averred that he had been unable to obtain any documents from\nthe mortgage holder addressing the status of his mortgage payments.  Applicant Exhibit G, Memo\nwith Attachments, dated June 11, 2010.  Applicant did not state or suggest that evidence to this\neffect could be obtained in the near future, and he did not request a further extension of time.\nFurthermore, in light of the Judge\u2019s favorable credibility determination and the reasons set forth for\nhis adverse conclusions, it is not clear how much difference corroborative evidence might have made\nin this case.  \nAt the beginning of the hearing, the Judge advised Applicant of his right to obtain counsel.\nThe Judge concluded that, based on Applicant\u2019s level of education, his facility with the English\nlanguage, and his prior experience in applying for a security clearance, Applicant was qualified to\nrepresent himself.  Tr. at 6-7.  Furthermore, Applicant was advised in writing prior to the hearing\nof his right to counsel, to present evidence, etc.  Memorandum from DOHA, entitled Prehearing\nGuidance for DOHA Industrial Security Clearance (ISCR) Hearings and Trustworthiness (ADP)\nHearings.  The Judge concluded that Applicant was capable of representing himself, and this\nconclusion was not error.  \nAlthough pro se applicants cannot be expected to act like lawyers, they are expected to take\ntimely, reasonable steps to protect their rights under the Directive.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 09-\n\n4\n01074 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 16, 2009).  Neither Applicant\u2019s brief nor the record point to additional\nmitigating evidence which Applicant could have presented if he had been aware of the need to do\nso.  There is no reason to conclude that the Judge denied Applicant a fair opportunity to present\nevidence in mitigation.  Applicant appears to have represented himself adequately.  He has not\ndemonstrated that he was denied the due process afforded by the Directive.  \nRemaining Issues\nAfter reviewing the record, we conclude that the Judge did not err in his treatment of the\nmitigating conditions or of the whole-person factors.  He examined the relevant data and articulated\na satisfactory explanation for the decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the facts found\nand the choice made.\u2019\u201d  Motor Vehicle Mfrs.

This company was still engaging in negotiations with the lender at the close of the record. Applicant has not made a mortgage payment since April 2009, stating that the lender had told him to stop payments during negotiations. He provided no evidence in corroboration. At the close of the record, Applicant was $40,000 in arrears in his mortgage payments. Applicant has been employed in the same position since he bought the house. He has not experienced a diminution of pay, nor has he amassed other debts. He has paid off a judgment against him for credit card debt, which was also alleged in the SOR. He paid off two other debts that were not alleged. If his proposed loan modification is not approved, he will have to give up his house. He has received no financial counseling, other than his arrangement with the company referenced above. He had sought a debt consolidation through his credit union, but his request was denied. Applicant enjoys an excellent reputation at work for his professionalism, trustworthiness, and loyalty. 3 In the Analysis portion of the decision, the Judge concluded that, under the circumstances of this case, Applicant\u2019s financial problems did not originate from circumstances outside his control. The Judge acknowledged Applicant\u2019s efforts to obtain a loan modification. However, he stated that Applicant\u2019s merely having enrolled in a loan modification program is not sufficient to demonstrate a good-faith effort to pay debts. He noted that this program had been ongoing since the summer of 2008, with no demonstrated results as of the close of the record. Indeed, the Judge also noted that, given Applicant\u2019s income and expenses, it is not clear that he would even be able to make payments under a modified loan. Furthermore, the Judge raised reasonable questions concerning the alleged advice Applicant received from his lender to the effect that he should make no payments during negotiations over loan modification, questions which Applicant\u2019s evidence did not answer. Due Process Issue Applicant contends that the Judge denied him due process. He argues that, in light of his pro se status at the hearing, he was not aware of the kind of evidence that would have benefitted his case for mitigation. He argues that the Judge should have given him more time after the hearing to present corroborating evidence concerning his loan modification. However, the record demonstrates that the Judge did hold the record open for two weeks following the May 27, 2010, hearing to enable Applicant to submit additional evidence concerning, among other things, the loan modification. The Judge specifically stated that Applicant could, if he chose, present something in writing from the lender regarding Applicant\u2019s claim that he was told not to make mortgage payments during negotiations. Tr. at 128-129. Applicant subsequently presented additional documents. However, he averred that he had been unable to obtain any documents from the mortgage holder addressing the status of his mortgage payments. Applicant Exhibit G, Memo with Attachments, dated June 11, 2010. Applicant did not state or suggest that evidence to this effect could be obtained in the near future, and he did not request a further extension of time. Furthermore, in light of the Judge\u2019s favorable credibility determination and the reasons set forth for his adverse",

However, \nApplicant has not mitigated the Financial Considerations security concerns. Eligibility for \naccess to classified information is denied.  \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn January 8, 2010, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued \na Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under Guideline \nF, Financial Considerations and Guideline E, Personal Conduct. DOHA acted under \nExecutive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \n(February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG). \n \nApplicant answered the SOR, initially on February 1, 2010, followed by a March \n2, 2010 supplemental answer. He also requested an administrative determination, but \nJuly 29, 2010\n\n \n2 \n \nthe Department Counsel requested a hearing. The case was assigned to me on April \n22, 2010. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on April 23, 2010, and the hearing was \nconvened as scheduled on May 27, 2010. The Government offered Exhibits (GE) 1 \nthrough 6, which were received without objection. Department Counsel\u2019s exhibit index is \nmarked as Hearing Exhibit (HE) I. Applicant testified, called two witnesses, and \nsubmitted Exhibits (AE) A through E, which were admitted without objection. The record \nwas held open for Applicant to submit additional information. Applicant submitted \ndocuments, which were marked AE F and G and admitted without objection. \nDepartment Counsel\u2019s post-hearing memorandum is marked HE II. DOHA received the \nhearing transcript (Tr.) on June 9, 2010.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is a 32-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has worked for \nhis current employer since January 2005. In 1999, he earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in \ncomputer science. He is single and has no children. He currently earns approximately \n$85,000 per year. He currently holds a security clearance1  \n \n \nThe SOR alleges two delinquent debts including a judgment. The debts were \nlisted on credit reports obtained on October 23, 2008 and December 5, 2009. Applicant \nadmitted owing the debts alleged in SOR.2  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems arose when he bought a home in May 2007. His \nmortgage was approximately $328,000 after making a $2,000 down payment to buy the \nhouse. This was a 40-year mortgage at a 6.75% fixed interest rate. His original monthly \npayments were about $2,500 per month. In May 2008, Applicant was struggling to make \nhis mortgage payments. He became over extended on his credit card debt and his \nmortgage payments increased by approximately $250 per month starting in July 2008. \nApplicant asked the lender why his payments increased and was told it was because of \nan escrow adjustment. Sometime during the spring of 2008, Applicant began skipping \nmortgage payments about every other month. In July 2008, Applicant applied with a \nnonprofit corporation for assistance in seeking a loan modification from his lender. The \nlast update from the nonprofit corporation (June 22, 2010) shows that it is still \nnegotiating with the Applicant\u2019s lender over a loan modification. The last mortgage \npayment he made was in April 2009. He testified he stopped because he was told by \nthe lender not to make any further payments while he was in the process of negotiating \na loan modification. He offered no documents from the lender supporting this assertion. \nHe currently owes over $40,000 on missed mortgage payments on the debt listed at \nSOR \u00b6 1.a.3    \n \n \n \n                                                          \n1 Tr. at 45-47, 52. \n \n2 Applicant\u2019s Answer to SOR (AA). \n \n3 AA; Tr. at 57-61, 63-70; AE B; GE 6. \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \nApplicant has been employed in the same position since he bought his home. He \nhas not suffered any diminution of pay since he bought his home. Additionally, he did \nnot take on any other major debt obligations since he bought his home. Rather than \nsaving the money that was supposed to go to his mortgage payments, Applicant paid \nthe credit card judgment (SOR \u00b6 1.b) and two other debts not listed in the SOR. If \nApplicant\u2019s loan modification is not approved he will have to give up the house, possibly \nthrough a short sale. His personal financial statement indicates that he has a monthly \ndeficit of approximately $500 per month.4   \n \n \nApplicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for National Security Position (e-\nQIP) on October 7, 2008. He answered \u201cNo\u201d to Sections 28 a. and 28 b., which asked, \nrespectively, in the last 7 years have you been over 180 days delinquent on any debt or \ncurrently 90 days delinquent on any debt? Applicant fully discussed his finances and \ndelinquent debts when he was interviewed for his background investigation in \nNovember 2008. He responded truthfully to DOHA interrogatories in April 2009 and \nAugust 2009. He was open and candid about his finances at his hearing. Applicant \ndenied intending to mislead the government about his finances. He credibly testified that \nhe did not know that his mortgage was either 180 days or 90 days overdue. Because he \nwas continuously attempting to catch up with his delinquent mortgage payments, it was \nunclear in his mind if he had ever been 180 days or 90 days delinquent on his \nmortgage.5 After considering all the evidence, I find that Applicant did not intentionally \nfalsify his e-QIP. \n \n \nApplicant did not receive financial counseling other than his dealings with the \nnonprofit corporation assisting with his loan modification. He also sought a loan \nconsolidation from his credit union. The credit union turned him down.6   \n \n \nApplicant had two coworkers testify and they expressed favorable opinions about \nApplicant\u2019s professionalism, honesty, trustworthiness, and loyalty. They were both \naware of Applicant\u2019s financial problems. Additionally, a character letter from a friend, \nwho has known Applicant since 1999, describes him as \u201can honorable and trustworthy \ncitizen\u201d.7   \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions that are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n                                                          \n4 Tr. at 95, 100-105; GE 4. \n \n5 Tr. at 78-80, GE 1, 3-5.  \n6 Tr. at 61-62. \n \n7 Tr. at 111-114, 118-122; AE E. \n\n \n4 \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable decision.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern for Financial Considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18, as \nfollows:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \n\n \n5 \n \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. Two are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n \n(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and \n \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \n \nApplicant accumulated delinquent debts and a judgment and was unable or \nunwilling to satisfy his obligations. The evidence is sufficient to raise the above \ndisqualifying conditions. \n \n \n  \nSeveral Financial Considerations mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are \npotentially applicable:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control;  \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \nApplicant still owes $40,000 of missed monthly payments on his mortgage, with \nno progress on a loan modification plan. His financial issues are current and ongoing. \nAG \u00b6 20(a) is not applicable.  \n \nThere is nothing about Applicant\u2019s financial condition that was caused by events \nbeyond his control. He decided to buy a home in 2007 and had a good paying job to \nsupport that decision. He still has that job and no unexpected expenses, such as major \n\n \n6 \n \nmedical bills, etc., arose to cause him financial distress. His mortgage payments did rise \nby $250 per month caused by escrow adjustments, but this type of increase is not \nuncommon. I find there were no conditions that were outside his control. AG \u00b6 20(b) is \nnot applicable.  \n \n \nAlthough Applicant is attempting to have his mortgage loan modified, there is no \ncertainty that it will be modified. He has not sought out financial counseling aside from \nenrolling in the modification program. His finances are not being resolved and are not \nunder control. His pay off of the judgment listed at SOR \u00b6 1.b is insufficient to support a \nfinding that he has made a good-faith effort to pay or otherwise resolve his debts. \nLikewise, merely enrolling into a loan modification program does not amount to a good \nfaith effort to repay the loan under these circumstances.8 AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(c) and 20(d) are not \napplicable to the debt listed at SOR \u00b6 1.a. Applicant does not dispute the debts. AG \u00b6 \n20(e) is not applicable.  \n \n \nAt this point, Applicant\u2019s finances remain a concern despite the presence of \nsome mitigation. \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct  \n \nThe trustworthiness concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set \nout in AG \u00b6 15: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \n[sensitive] information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the [public trust position] process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the [public trust position] process. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a trustworthiness concern and may \nbe disqualifying. The following disqualifying condition is potentially applicable: \n \n                                                          \n8 The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a \u201cgood-faith\u201d effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts: \n \nIn order to qualify for application of Financial Considerations Mitigating Condition 6, an \napplicant must present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue \ncreditors or some other good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant\u2019s debts. The \nDirective does not define the term \u2018good-faith.\u2019 However, the Board has indicated that the \nconcept of good-faith \u2018requires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows \nreasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.\u2019 Accordingly, \nan applicant must do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally available \noption (such as bankruptcy) in order to claim the benefit of Financial Considerations \nMitigating Condition 6.  \n \n(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2004) (quoting \nISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. Jun. 4, 2001)). \n\n \n7 \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \n \n \nApplicant submitted inaccurate information on his e-QIP, but as discussed above, \nit was not an intentional falsification. AG \u00b6 16(a) is not applicable. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.       \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nrelevant facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 \n2(a) were addressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment.  \n \nI considered Applicant\u2019s favorable character evidence. I also found Applicant to \nbe honest and candid about his finances. Appellant\u2019s mortgage delinquency remains a \nconcern. Although he is seeking a loan modification, that process has been ongoing \nsince July 2008, with no outcome and a positive result is speculative at this point. Even \nif the loan is somewhat modified, according to Applicant\u2019s current income to expense \nworksheet, he still could not afford the payments. He has no contingency plans if the \nmodification does not go through.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant did mitigate the Personal Conduct concerns, but did not mitigate the \nFinancial Considerations security concerns.  \n \n\n \n8 \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.b: \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nRobert E.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Based on the record evidence as a whole, the following facts are established by substantial evidence. Applicant is a 58-year-old employee of a federal contractor. He is seeking to obtain a security clearance, although he held one in the past. He is twice married, divorced once, and separated from his current wife since 2005. He is the father of five children, all adults, the youngest of whom is 18 years old. Applicant\u2019s employment history includes working as a field service representative for another federal contractor from 1996 to December 2005, when he decided to quit that job. This was approximately the same time (2005) when he and his wife separated. He was unemployed from December 2005 to June 2007. He worked as a maintenance technician from June 2007 to May 2008, when he was fired due to a disagreement with another employee. He was then unemployed until October 2008, when he began his Tr. 62. 3 Tr. 37; Exhibits 1\u20136. 4 Exhibit M. 5 Exhibit F. 6 Exhibit D. 7 3 current employment as a field service representative, and has been working full-time in this position since April 2009.

Blank Jr., Esq., Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro se  \n                     \n           \n______________\nDecision\n______________\nLEONARD, Michael H., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant contests the Defense Department\u2019s intent to deny or revoke his\neligibility for a security clearance to work in the defense industry. The record evidence\nshows Applicant has a history of financial problems, to include state and federal tax\ndebts. There is insufficient evidence to explain, extenuate, or mitigate the security\nconcerns stemming from his history of financial problems. Accordingly, as explained in\nfurther detail below, this case is decided against Applicant.\nJune 17, 2010\n\n  This case is adjudicated under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry,\n1\nsigned by President Eisenhower on February 20, 1960, as amended, as well as DoD Directive 5220.6,\nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program, dated January 2, 1992, as amended\n(Directive). In addition, the Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified\nInformation (AG), effective within the Defense Department on September 1, 2006, apply to this case.  The AG\nwere published in the Federal Register and codified in 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 154, Appendix H (2006). The AG replace\nthe guidelines in Enclosure 2 to the Directive.   \n Exhibits G\u2013M.\n2\n2\nStatement of the Case\nActing under the relevant Executive Order and DoD Directive,  on October 15,\n1\n2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (the Agency) issued a statement of\nreasons (SOR) explaining it was unable to find it is clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant Applicant access to classified information. The SOR is similar to a\ncomplaint, and it detailed the factual basis for the action under the security guideline\nknown as Guideline F for financial considerations. The SOR also recommended that the\ncase be submitted to an administrative judge to decide whether to deny or revoke\nApplicant\u2019s security clearance.  \nApplicant answered the SOR in a timely fashion and requested a hearing. The\ncase was assigned to me December 3, 2009. The hearing took place February 3, 2010.\nThe hearing transcript (Tr.) was received February 12, 2010. \nThe record was kept open until March 1, 2010, to allow Applicant to submit\nadditional documentary evidence. He did so in a timely manner, and those matters are\nadmitted without objections.   \n2\nFindings of Fact\nBased on the record evidence as a whole, the following facts are established by\nsubstantial evidence.\nApplicant is a 58-year-old employee of a federal contractor. He is seeking to\nobtain a security clearance, although he held one in the past. He is twice married,\ndivorced once, and separated from his current wife since 2005. He is the father of five\nchildren, all adults, the youngest of whom is 18 years old. \nApplicant\u2019s employment history includes working as a field service representative\nfor another federal contractor from 1996 to December 2005, when he decided to quit\nthat job. This was approximately the same time (2005) when he and his wife separated.\nHe was unemployed from December 2005 to June 2007. He worked as a maintenance\ntechnician from June 2007 to May 2008, when he was fired due to a disagreement with\nanother employee. He was then unemployed until October 2008, when he began his\n\n Tr. 62. \n3\n Tr. 37; Exhibits 1\u20136. \n4\n Exhibit M. \n5\n Exhibit F. \n6\n Exhibit D. \n7\n3\ncurrent employment as a field service representative, and has been working full-time in\nthis position since April 2009. His annual salary is about $52,000.  \n3\nAfter Applicant quit his job in 2005 and separated from his wife, he became\ndepressed to the point that he was hospitalized. This took place when Applicant did not\nhave health insurance. \nApplicant has a history of financial problems, which he does not dispute, for more\nthan ten years.  His history includes a Chapter 7 bankruptcy case in 1999, state and\n4\nfederal tax debts, and delinquent consumer debts. \nHis tax debts were caused by an early withdrawal from a retirement account\nwhen he cashed out a 401(k) account. He used the proceeds for his living expenses\nwhen he was unemployed.  \nAs of June 2009, he owed the IRS $5,348 for tax year 2006 and $3,627 for tax\nyear 2007.  He has an installment agreement with the IRS under which he is making\n5\nmonthly payments. He presented documentary proof of nine monthly payments to the\nIRS in 2009.   \n6\nAs of January 2010, he owed the state a total of $3,538 broken down as follows:\n$1,940 for tax year 2006, $641 for tax year 2007, and $956 for tax year 2008.  The state\n7\nhas obtained judgments against Applicant for tax years 2007 and 2008.  \nIn addition to the bankruptcy and tax debts, the SOR alleges eight delinquent\ndebts with various creditors. The table below summarizes the current status of those\neight debts.  \nDebts\nStatus\nSOR \u00b6 1.c\u2013$731 collection account.\nPaid in Feb. 2010.

(Exhibit\nL)\nTo sum up, six of the eight consumer debts are paid. Two remain with a total balance\ndue of about $8,237, with one debt more than $8,000. \n \nPolicies\nThis section sets forth the general principles of law and policies that apply to an\nindustrial security clearance case. To start, the only purpose of a clearance decision is\nto decide if an applicant is suitable for access to classified information.\nIt is well-established law that no one has a right to a security clearance.  As\n8\nnoted by the Supreme Court in the case of Department of Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe clearly\nconsistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they\nmust, on the side of denials.\u201d  Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive,\n9\nany doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified\ninformation will be resolved in favor of protecting national security.  \nA favorable clearance decision establishes eligibility of an applicant to be granted\na security clearance for access to confidential, secret, or top-secret information.  An\n10\nunfavorable decision (1) denies any application, (2) revokes any existing security\nclearance, and (3) prevents access to classified information at any level.  \n11\nThere is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for\naccess to classified information.  The Government has the burden of presenting\n12\nevidence to establish facts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted.  An\n13\n\n Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n14\n Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n15\n Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n16\n ISCR Case No. 01-20700 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002) (citations omitted).\n17\n Executive Order 10865, \u00a7 7.\n18\n AG \u00b6\u00b6 18, 19, and 20 (setting forth the security concern and the disqualifying and mitigating conditions). \n19\n AG \u00b6 18.  \n20\n5\napplicant is responsible for presenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate\nfacts that have been admitted or proven.  In addition, an applicant has the ultimate\n14\nburden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.  In Egan, the Supreme\n15\nCourt stated that the burden of proof is less than a preponderance of the evidence.16\nThe DOHA Appeal Board has followed the Court\u2019s reasoning, and a judge\u2019s findings of\nfact are reviewed under the substantial-evidence standard.17\nThe Adjudicative Guidelines set forth the relevant standards to consider when\nevaluating a person\u2019s security clearance eligibility, including disqualifying conditions\n(DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) for each guideline. In addition, each clearance\ndecision must be a commonsense decision based upon consideration of all the relevant\nand material information, the pertinent criteria and adjudication factors, and the whole-\nperson concept. \nA person granted access to classified information enters into a special\nrelationship with the Government. The Government must be able to have a high degree\nof trust and confidence in those persons to whom it grants access to classified\ninformation. The decision to deny a person a security clearance is not a determination\nof an applicant\u2019s loyalty.  Instead, it is a determination that an applicant has not met the\n18\nstrict guidelines the President has established for granting eligibility for access.\nAnalysis\nUnder Guideline F for financial considerations,  the suitability of an applicant\n19\nmay be questioned or put into doubt when that applicant has a history of excessive\nindebtedness, financial problems or difficulties, or financial irresponsibility. A security\nconcern typically exists due to significant unpaid debts. The overall concern under\nGuideline F is that: \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to\nprotect classified information.  \n20\n\n AG \u00b6 19(a).  \n21\n AG \u00b6 19(c). \n22\n AG \u00b6 20 (a) \u2013 (f) (setting forth six mitigating conditions). \n23\n6\nSimilarly, an individual who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible,\nunconcerned, negligent, or careless in properly handling and safeguarding classified\ninformation.   \nThe record here supports a conclusion that Applicant has a history of financial\nproblems or difficulties. This history raises concerns because it indicates inability or\nunwillingness to satisfy debts  and a history of not meeting financial obligations  within\n21\n22\nthe meaning of Guideline F. The facts are sufficient to establish these two disqualifying\nconditions.   \nUnder Guideline F, there are six conditions that may mitigate security concerns:23\n(a) The behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred\nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast\ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment;\n(b) The conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely\nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business\ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or\nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;\n(c) The person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is\nunder control;\n(d) The individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or\notherwise resolve debts;\n(e) The individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the\npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides\ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides\nevidence of actions to resolve the issue; and \n(f) The affluence resulted from a legal source of income.\nThe most pertinent here are subparagraphs (b) and (d) based on Applicant\u2019s\nperiods of unemployment and his efforts to repay his debts within his means. But the\ncredit in mitigation is insufficient to overcome the security concerns. Applicant is facing\nmore than $20,000 in delinquent debts, with more than $12,000 owed to state and\n\n AG \u00b6 2(a)(1) \u2013 (9).\n24\n7\nfederal tax authorities. He has paid six of the eight consumer debts, but he has made no\nprogress in addressing the other two, which account for more than $8,000. Although I\nam persuaded Applicant is sincere and genuinely wants to take care of his delinquent\ndebts, the record is insufficient to make any safe predictive judgments that Applicant will\nresolve the remaining debts anytime soon. In addition, I note that the state and federal\ntax debts are viewed with disfavor, and I gave those matters substantial weight in my\nanalysis.    \nTo conclude, the facts and circumstances surrounding Applicant\u2019s ongoing\nfinancial problems justify current doubts about his judgment, reliability, and\ntrustworthiness. Following Egan and the clearly-consistent standard, these doubts are\nresolved in favor of protecting national security. In reaching this conclusion, I gave due\nconsideration to the whole-person concept  and Applicant\u2019s favorable evidence.\n24\nNevertheless, Applicant did not meet his ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a\nfavorable clearance decision. This case is decided against Applicant. \nFormal Findings\nThe formal findings on the SOR allegations are as follows:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.a\u20131.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraphs 1.c\u20131.g:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.i:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.j\u20131.m:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of the record as a whole, it is not clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to\nclassified information is denied.        \nMichael H. Leonard\nAdministrative Judge \n",

The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified\nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense\nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program\n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG)\npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the\nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nOn August 21, 2009, Applicant replied to the SOR (RSOR) in writing, and he\nrequested a hearing before an Administrative Judge. I received the case assignment on\nSeptember 9, 2009. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on September 15, 2009, and I\nconvened the hearing as scheduled on October 19, 2009. The Government offered\nExhibits 1 through 5, which were received without objection. Applicant testified on his\nown behalf and submitted Exhibit A at the time of hearing, which was also admitted\nwithout objection. Applicant\u2019s father also testified on his behalf. DOHA received the\ntranscript of the hearing (Tr) on October 27, 2009. I granted Applicant\u2019s request to keep\n\n2\nthe record open until November 2, 2009, to submit additional documents. He timely\nsubmitted three additional documents, which have been identified and entered into\nevidence collectively as Exhibit B. Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings,\nexhibits, and the testimony of Applicant and his father, eligibility for access to classified\ninformation is denied.\nFindings of Fact\nIn his RSOR, Applicant admitted SOR allegations 1.b. through 1.r., and 1.u. He\ndenied 1.a., 1.s., and 1.t. The admitted allegations are incorporated herein as findings of\nfact. \nAfter a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record described\nabove, and upon due consideration of that evidence, I make the additional findings of\nfact: \nApplicant is 35 years old. He is unmarried and has no children. Applicant is\nemployed by a defense contractor, and he seeks a DoD security clearance in\nconnection with his employment in the defense sector.\nThe SOR lists 21 allegations (1.a. through 1.u.) regarding financial difficulties\nunder Adjudicative Guideline F.  The allegations will be discussed below in the same\norder as they were listed on the SOR:\n1.a. This overdue debt to a state tax board is cited in the SOR in the amount of\n$12,003.  Applicant testified that this debt has been partially paid through a levy that has\nbeen placed on his income, in the amount of $335 per paycheck, which he receives\nevery two weeks. This has occurred for approximately two years. (Tr at 24-26.) Later at\nthe hearing, Applicant amended his testimony to indicate the amount levied per\npaycheck was $349 (Tr at 35.)  Exhibit B includes a statement from a representative of\nthe current employer of Applicant, in which she writes that the state tax board has thus\nfar been paid $6,769.36. The documentation upon which she is basing this statement\nwas not submitted. Finally, no evidence was offered to show that this debt has been\nresolved. \n1.b. This overdue debt to a state tax board is cited in the SOR in the amount of\n$1,262. This debt has not been resolved. (RSOR and Tr at 28.) \n \n1.c. This overdue debt to a state tax board is cited in the SOR in the amount of\n$1,038. Based on a review of the latest credit report (Exhibit 5), it appears that this debt\nhas been released by the state tax board. At the hearing, Department Counsel\nconfirmed that this debt had been released and is therefore, resolved. (Tr at 28-29.)\n1.d. This overdue debt to a state tax board is cited in the SOR in the amount of\n$937. This debt has not been resolved. (RSOR and Tr at 30.) \n \n\n3\n1.e. This overdue debt to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) is cited in the SOR\nin the amount of $6,257. This debt has not been resolved. (RSOR and Tr at 30-32.) \n1.f. This overdue debt to the IRS is cited in the SOR in the amount of $36,993.\nThis debt has not been resolved. (RSOR and Tr at 30-32.) \n1.g. This overdue debt to the IRS is cited in the SOR in the amount of $129. This\ndebt has not been resolved. (RSOR and Tr at 30-32.) \n1.h. This overdue debt to the IRS is cited in the SOR in the amount of $2,593.\nApplicant also testified that the IRS has placed a levy on his paycheck. (Tr at 29.)\nApplicant\u2019s financial advisor also states that the IRS has thus far been paid $1,788.86.\n(Exhibit B.) Based on a review of Exhibit 5, it also appears that this debt has been\nreleased by the IRS. At the hearing, Department Counsel also confirmed that this debt\nhad been released and is therefore, resolved. (Tr at 28-29.)\n1.i. This overdue debt to the IRS is cited in the SOR in the amount of $3,292.\nThis debt has not been resolved. (RSOR and Tr at 30-32.) \n1.j. This overdue debt is cited in the SOR in the amount of $143. This debt has\nnot been resolved. (RSOR and Tr at 32.) \n1.k. This overdue debt is cited in the SOR in the amount of $372. This debt has\nnot been resolved. (RSOR and Tr at 32.) \n1.l. This overdue debt is cited in the SOR in the amount of $2,706, with a balance\nof $9,576. This debt has not been resolved. (RSOR and Tr at 32.) \n1.m.

This debt\nhas not been resolved. (RSOR and Tr at 32.)  \n1.o. This overdue debt is cited in the SOR in the amount of $1,184. This debt has\nnot been resolved. (RSOR and Tr at 32-33.)  \n1.p. This overdue debt is cited in the SOR in the amount of $114. This debt has\nnot been resolved. (RSOR and Tr at 33.)  \n1.q. This overdue debt is cited in the SOR in the amount of $86. This debt has\nnot been resolved. (RSOR and Tr at 33.) \n1.r. This overdue debt is cited in the SOR in the amount of $3,773. This debt has\nnot been resolved. (RSOR and Tr at 33.) \n\n4\n1.s. This overdue debt is cited in the SOR in the amount of $5,669. In his RSOR,\nApplicant denied this allegation, but at the hearing Applicant admitted that this debt is\nstill due and owing. (Tr at 33.)\n1.t. This overdue debt is cited in the SOR in the amount of $18,195. In his RSOR,\nApplicant also denied this allegation, but at the hearing Applicant admitted that this debt\nis still due and owing. (Tr at 33-34.)\n1.u. Applicant\u2019s Personal Financial Statement (PFS), submitted on April 25,\n2009, shows that he has a negative monthly net remainder. Applicant\u2019s PFS shows that\nhis monthly income is $1,950.18 and his monthly expenses are $1,950, leaving him with\na net remainder at the end of each month of $.18. (Exhibit 2.) At the hearing, Applicant\ntestified that this PFS is still accurate (Tr at 34-35.)\nApplicant testified that he has a plan to pay off some of these debts, but thus far,\nwith the exception of the state tax board and the IRS, he had not contacted any other\ncreditor. (Tr at 37.) He further stated that he is scheduled to receive an increase in his\nsalary of $240 per pay period (every two weeks), and he plans to use that to pay some\nof these debts, although thus far he has not contacted any of the creditors with his new\nplan. (Tr at 38-39.)\nApplicant testified that he started his own cell phone and pager business just\nafter he completed high school, and he ran it from 1991 to 2006. In 2001 his brother\ndied unexpectedly and in 2004 one of his uncles died. This resulted in him being in a\ndepression, and he conceded that for a number of years thereafter he did not monitor\nthe business properly. Also, there was more competition in the business, so he\nultimately let the business dissolve. (Tr at 39-40.). \nMitigation\nAs stated above, Applicant\u2019s father testified on his son\u2019s behalf. He confirmed\nthat his son started his own business at 18 years of age, and after his brother died in\n2001, Applicant did not pay enough attention to his business. He also confirmed that his\nuncle died in 2004. Finally, his father testified that Applicant does not have any credit\ncards at this time, and he is doing well in his current employment. (Tr at 48-54.)\nApplicant submitted three positive character letters in Exhibit C, from individuals\nwho know him in his current employment. He was described as someone who \u201chas\nalways exhibited good work habits and ethics.\u201d and \u201ca trustworthy and dependable\nperson displaying sound judgement and a good work ethic.\u201d\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\n\n5\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c),\nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the\n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable\ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a\ndecision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n\n6\nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set\nout in AG \u00b6 18:  \n      Failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns and\ncould potentially apply in this case.  Under AG \u00b6 19 (a), \u201can inability or unwillingness to\nsatisfy debts\u201d is potentially disqualifying. Similarly under AG \u00b6  19 (c), \u201ca history of not\nmeeting financial obligations\u201d may raise security concerns. I find that both of these\ndisqualifying conditions apply to Applicant in this case. The evidence has established\nthat Applicant accumulated significant delinquent debt. \nAG \u00b6 20 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns from financial\ndifficulties: Under AG \u00b6  20 (b), \u201cit may be mitigating where the conditions that resulted\nin the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of\nemployment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce\nor separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.\u201d As noted\nabove, Applicant testified that his financial problems resulted from the failure of his\nbusiness, significantly after the death of his brother put him into a deep depression.\nHowever, since he has not repaid or resolved the majority of his considerable overdue\ndebt, I can not find that he has acted responsibly. Therefore, I do not find that this\npotentially mitigating condition is a factor for consideration in this case. \nI conclude that until Applicant is able to significantly reduce his overdue debt, and\nshow that he can maintain more financial stability, he has not mitigated the financial\nconcerns of the Government.\nWhole-Person Concept\nUnder the whole-person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\n\n7\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nUnder AG \u00b6 2 (c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a\nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.      \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Based on all of the reasons cited\nabove as to why the Disqualifying Conditions apply  and no Mitigating Condition applies,\nI find that the record evidence leaves me with significant questions and doubts as to\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance under the whole-person\nconcept. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the security\nconcerns. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a. and 1.b.:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraphs 1.d through 1.g.:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraphs 1.i through 1.u.:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraphs 1.c and 1.h.:\nFor Applicant \nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is  not\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n                                              \nMartin H. Mogul\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro se\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On July 21, 2009, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the\nbasis for that decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline G (Alcohol Consumption),\nGuideline E (Personal Conduct), and Guideline J (Criminal Conduct) of Department of Defense\nDirective 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.  On June\n18, 2010, after the hearing, Administrative Judge Martin H. Mogul denied Applicant\u2019s request for\na security clearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge failed to consider record\nevidence favorable to Applicant; whether Applicant was denied due process; and whether the\n\nJudge\u2019s adverse security clearance decision was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  Consistent\nwith the following discussion, we affirm the decision of the Judge.\nThe Judge made the following pertinent findings of fact: Applicant is employed by a Defense\ncontractor and is seeking a security clearance in connection with his job.  In March 2006, Applicant\nwas arrested and charged with burglary, assault with a deadly weapon, and public discharge of a\nfirearm.  He had been drinking on the day of the offense.  He threatened his next-door neighbor with\na gun and fired it twice into the ground in front of her porch.  Pursuant to a plea agreement, he was\nconvicted of the assault charge and sentenced to three years of confinement (suspended).  He was\nordered to undergo three years of probation, during which time he was to abstain from possessing\nor consuming alcohol.  He also was required to attend a residential rehabilitation clinic and to attend\nAlcoholics Anonymous (AA).  \nThe record includes evidence of previous alcohol related offenses.  In March 1995, Applicant\nwas arrested and charged with DUI.  He was fined $1,000.  In March 1986 Applicant was arrested\nfor DUI, although his breathalyzer results were below the legal limit.  Applicant admitted, however,\nthat he had consumed beer before driving.\nApplicant abstained from alcohol from 2006 to 2008.  However, he resumed drinking in\n2008, during which time he was still on probation.  He enjoys an excellent reputation for the quality\nof his job performance.  On appeal, Applicant denies drinking any alcohol in 2008.  The Judge\u2019s\nfindings on this point conform to the record evidence.  Tr. at 41-42; Decision at 3.\nApplicant contends that the Judge did not consider favorable record evidence concerning the\nhigh quality of his job performance.  However, a Judge is presumed to have considered all of the\nevidence in the record.  See ISCR Case No. 09-05830 at 2 (App. Bd. Jun. 25, 2010).  As stated\nabove, the Judge made explicit findings concerning Applicant\u2019s job performance.  However, his\nexplanation as to why he concluded that Applicant had failed to meet his burden of persuasion as to\nmitigation reflects a reasonable interpretation of the record, viewed as a whole.  Applicant has not\nrebutted the presumption that the Judge considered all of the record evidence.  Neither has he\ndemonstrated that the Judge weighed the evidence in an arbitrary or capricious manner.  Id.  \nApplicant states that, though he originally thought that he did not need counsel to represent\nhim at the hearing, upon reflection he believes that his failure to have counsel led to the adverse\ndecision in his case.  We construe this as an argument that Applicant was denied due process.  The\nrecord demonstrates that Applicant received pre-hearing guidance advising him of his right to\nemploy counsel.  Additionally, at the beginning of the hearing, the Judge advised Applicant of this\nright and conducted an inquiry to determine whether Applicant was capable of representing himself,\nconcluding in the affirmative.  Tr. at 4-5.  There is no indication that Applicant was denied the due\nprocess afforded by the Directive.  See ISCR Case No. 08-03110 at 2 (App. Bd. Jan. 27, 2009).  \nAfter reviewing the record, the Board concludes that the Judge examined the relevant data\nand articulated a satisfactory explanation for the decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between\nthe facts found and the choice made.\u2019\u201d  Motor Vehicle Mfrs.

The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines\n(AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the\nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nOn August 4, 2009, Applicant replied to the SOR (RSOR) in writing, and he\nrequested a hearing before an Administrative Judge. The case was assigned to this\nAdministrative Judge on September 16, 2009. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on\nNovember 16, 2009, and I convened the hearing as scheduled on December 22, 2009.\nThe Government offered Exhibits 1 through 11, which were received without objection.\nApplicant testified on his own behalf and submitted Exhibits A through F, which were\nalso admitted without objection. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr) on\nJanuary 7, 2010. Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and the\ntestimony of Applicant, eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n\n2\nFindings of Fact\nAfter a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, including\nApplicant's RSOR, the admitted documents, and the testimony of Applicant, and upon\ndue consideration of that evidence, I make the following findings of fact: \nApplicant is 57 years old. He is not currently married, but he was married from\n1973 to 1993, and he has three children. Applicant is employed by a defense contractor,\nfor whom he has worked for more than 38 years, and he seeks a DoD security\nclearance in connection with his employment in the defense sector.\nParagraph 1 (Guideline G - Alcohol Consumption) \nThe Government alleges that Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he has\nengaged in excessive alcohol consumption. The following are the allegations as they\nare cited in the SOR:\n1.a. In March 2006, Applicant was arrested and charged with (1) Burglary, (2)\nAssault with a deadly weapon-semiautomatic firearm, and (3) Discharge firearm in\npublic. Applicant was under the influence of alcohol at the time of the incident. In\nNovember 2006, Applicant was found guilty of count (2) and sentenced to three years\nconfinement-suspended. He was ordered to serve a formal probation for 3 years, during\nwhich time he was also ordered to abstain from possession or consumption of alcoholic\nbeverages. In his RSOR, Applicant admitted this allegation.\nAt the hearing, Applicant testified that on the day of this event he and some\nfriends had been celebrating St. Patrick\u2019s day at a restaurant, and thereafter he returned\nhome by taxi at approximately 1:30 or 2:00 P.M.  He has no recollection of what\noccurred during the rest of the night. He was informed the next day, by the police, that\nhis next door neighbor had informed them that Applicant threatened her with a gun, and\nshot two rounds into the ground in front of her porch. The police officer went with\nApplicant to examine Applicant\u2019s gun, and they found that two rounds were missing\nfrom the clip. Applicant had no explanation for the missing rounds. While he testified\nthat he had no memory of the incident, he did admit that bullet holes were found in the\nground of his neighbor, which helped to verify her story. (Tr at 31-37.)\nApplicant entered a plea bargain, and he was convicted of charge (2) Assault\nwith a deadly weapon-semiautomatic firearm. Applicant was ordered to attend a\nresidential rehabilitation clinic, where he remained full-time for four months and 20 days.\nHe subsequently stayed at a transitional living facility for six months during the night and\nwas allowed to resume employment during the day. He attended counseling meetings\nthree or four time a week at this facility. Additionally, Applicant was ordered to attend\nAlcoholics Anonymous meetings over a two year period. \n\n3\n1.b. In March 1995, Applicant was arrested and charged with Driving Under the\nInfluence of Alcohol (DUI).  In his RSOR and during his testimony, Applicant admitted\nthat he was guilty. He thereafter plead No Contest to the charge and paid a fine of\napproximately $1,000. (Tr at 49.)\n1.c. In December 1986, Applicant was arrested and charged with DUI. In his\nRSOR, Applicant denied this allegation. In a signed, written statement made to a\nDefense Investigative Service investigator on March 25, 1988, (Exhibit 1), Applicant\nstated that he was arrested in 1986 for DUI. However, when he took a Breathalyzer test,\nhis alcohol level was determined to be below the legal limit so the charges against him\nwere ultimately dropped when he went to court.  During his testimony, Applicant did\nconcede that he had consumed several beers before his arrest. (Tr at 63.)   \n1.d. The SOR alleges that Applicant continues to consumes alcohol in violation of\nhis probation. He testified that after his arrest in 2006, he abstained from alcohol\nconsumption for two years until 2008, when he began consuming alcohol again. Since\nthat time he continues to consume alcohol, and he has drunk as many as five beers in\none evening on more than one occasion. (Tr at 41-46.) \nApplicant testified that his probation continued from 2006 until November 1,\n2009. (Tr at 47.) Since he continued drinking alcohol in 2008 and 2009, during the time\nthat he was on probation, the evidence established that he drank while he was still on\nprobation. Applicant testified that he was not aware that his probation prohibited him\nfrom consuming alcohol, or he would not have done it. (Tr at 59-60.) However, Exhibit 5\nindicates that Applicant was not to drink or possess any alcoholic beverage during his\nthree year probation. Therefore, I find that Applicant did violate his probation\nrequirements.\nIn an affidavit made to a Government investigator and signed by Applicant on\nOctober 23, 2007, he stated, \u201cI no longer drink and intend to remain sober in the future.\u201d\nIn a later affidavit Applicant made to an investigator and signed on March 23, 2008, he\nreiterated, \u201cAs previously discussed, I no longer drink and I don\u2019t intend on having any\nalcohol or other problems in the future.\u201d Since Applicant began consuming alcohol again\nin 2008, he violated his own stated intention to abstain from alcohol consumption in the\nfuture. Applicant testified that he has been consuming beer for approximately 37 years.\nAfter some equivocation, Applicant conceded that both counseling programs he\nattended, and Alcoholics Anonymous, advised him and every person attending their\nprograms, to abstain from consuming alcohol. (Tr a 83-84.) When he was asked why he\ncontinues to drink alcohol, considering the problems alcohol has created in his life, he\nwas unable to furnish an answer. (Tr at 67-70.) \nParagraph 2 (Guideline E - Personal Conduct)\nThe SOR alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance\nbecause he exhibited conduct involving questionable judgement, lack of candor,\ndishonesty or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations.\n\n4\n2.a.  The SOR alleges that Applicant\u2019s conduct that is set forth under paragraph\n1.a. through 1.d., above, constitutes Personal Conduct violations. \n2.b. Applicant executed a signed Security Clearance Application (SCA) on\nOctober 20, 2008. (Exhibit 9.) Question 23.d. of the SCA asks, \u201cHave you ever been\ncharged with or convicted of any offense(s) related to alcohol or drugs? Applicant\nanswered \u201cYes,\u201d and he listed one arrest that is the subject of 1.a., discussed above.  It\nis alleged that Applicant failed to include the alcohol related charges, listed and\ndiscussed above as 1.b. and 1.c. \nApplicant testified that he did not include the arrest in 1986 because the charges\nwere dismissed. He could not explain his failure to include the arrest in 1995, but he\nappeared surprised that he had not included it on his SCA, and he averred that he did\nnot intend to mislead the Government by omitting this information. (Tr at 58.) He also\nexplained that he did tell the security officer of his company about each of his arrests. I\ndo not believe that Applicant intended to mislead the Government, or he certainly would\nhave omitted the more recent and far more serious arrest in 2006, which he did include\non his SCA. (Exhibit 5.) \nParagraph 3 (Guideline J - Criminal Conduct) \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant has engaged in criminal acts.\n3.a.  The SOR alleges that Applicant\u2019s conduct that is set forth under paragraph\n1.a. through 1.d., above, constitutes criminal actions. \nMitigation\nApplicant introduced a Confidential Patient Form (Exhibit C), which confirmed\nthat he was admitted on January 8, 2007, and discharged on May 8, 2007, and he\nfulfilled the residential requirements of the rehabilitation center that he attended as a\nresult of paragraph 1.c., above. He participated in a program that consisted of group\nand individual counseling, 12-step recovery meetings, and additional counseling\nsessions.  \nApplicant also submitted a character letter from the Quality and Mission Success\nManager of his employer, who wrote that Applicant has worked for him since March 20,\n2006, and he is considered a professional at all times. \u201cHis positive can do attitude is\nalways appreciated. I can count on him to always do what\u2019s right.\u201d  (Exhibit E)             \nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\n\n5\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nParagraph 1 (Guideline G - Alcohol Consumption)\nApplicant's alcohol consumption has resulted in one arrest and No Contest plea\nto Assault with a deadly weapon-semiautomatic firearm in 2006, and one DUI arrest and\nconviction in 1995.\nThe Government established that Applicant was involved in \u201calcohol-related\nincidents away from work,\u201d and \u201cbinge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired\njudgement.\u201d Disqualifying Conditions AG \u00b6 22(a) and (c) apply to this case.  \n\n6\nAs stated above, Applicant admitted to currently drinking beer, and to consuming\nas many as five beers at one time on more than one occasion. This is despite the fact\nthat Applicant has been advised not to consume any alcohol in the future by the two\nrehabilitation programs that he attended, and after he averred in two statements that he\nintended not to consume alcohol in the future. As a result of this, I do not find that any\nMitigating Condition under \u00b6 23 applies. Paragraph 1 is found against Applicant.\nParagraph 2 (Guideline E - Personal Conduct)\nWith respect to Guideline E, I find that Applicant testified credibly that he did not\nknowingly provide incorrect material information to the Government on the SCA\nregarding his DUI arrest and conviction in 1995, and his arrest and subsequent\ndismissal of a DUI in 1986.  \nI do  find that Applicant\u2019s resumption of alcohol consumption in 2008, despite\nalcohol contributing to the incident in 2006, receiving the advice from two treatment\ncenters to abstain from alcohol consumption, and Applicant making two written\naffidavits, in which he stated his intention not to consume alcohol in the future,\nestablishes \u00b6 16(d) \u201ca whole-person assessment of questionable judgement,\nuntrustworthiness, unreliability\u201d under this guideline.  I therefore, resolve Guideline E\nagainst Applicant.\nParagraph 3 (Guideline J - Criminal Conduct)\nThe Government also established that Applicant engaged in criminal conduct, by\nhis acts that are listed under paragraphs 1.a., 1.b., and 1.d. I do not find that the\nconduct listed under paragraph 1.c. is criminal.\nI find that \u00b6 31(a), \u201ca single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses,\u201d applies in\nthis case. \u00b6 31(c), \u201callegations or admissions of criminal conduct, regardless of whether\nthe person was formally charged,\u201d is also applicable to this case. Because Applicant\ncontinues to consume alcohol, which was the underlying cause of Applicant\u2019s criminal\nconduct, I do not find any Mitigating Condition under \u00b6 32 is applicable. Paragraph 3,\nGuideline J is found against Applicant\nWhole-Person Concept\nUnder the whole-person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\n\n7\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nUnder AG \u00b6 2 (c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a\nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.      \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Based on all of the reasons cited\nabove as to why the Disqualifying Conditions apply and the Mitigating Conditions do not\napply, I find that the record evidence leaves me with significant questions and doubts as\nto Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance under the whole-person\nconcept. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the security\nconcerns. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline G:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a., 1.b., 1.d.:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c.:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline E:\nAGAINST  APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a.:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b.:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 3, Guideline J:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 3.a.:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is  not\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n                                              \nMartin H. Mogul\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Accordingly, his request for a security clearance is granted. \n \n \nApplicant requested a security clearance by submitting an Electronic \nQuestionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-QIP) on November 11, 2008. After \nreviewing the results of the ensuing background investigation, adjudicators for the \nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) were unable to make a preliminary \naffirmative finding1 that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant \nApplicant\u2019s request.  \n \n \n1 Required by Executive Order 10865 and by DoD Directive 5220.6 (Directive), as amended. \nApril 29, 2010\n\n \n \n2\n                                                \nOn October 20, 2009, DOHA issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) \nthat specified the basis for its decision: security concerns addressed in the Directive \nunder Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of the Adjudicative Guidelines (AG).2 \nApplicant signed his notarized Answer on November 10, 2009.3 He admitted all \nallegations in the SOR. He also requested a hearing before an administrative judge. \nDepartment Counsel was prepared to proceed on February 1, 2010, and the case was \nassigned to me on the following day. DOHA issued a Notice of Hearing on February 17, \n2010, and I convened the hearing as scheduled on March 4, 2010. \n \nDuring the hearing, the government offered eight exhibits, which I admitted as \nGovernment Exhibits (GE) 1 through 8. Applicant testified and offered four exhibits, \nadmitted as Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AE) A through D. I held the record open to allow \nApplicant to submit additional documentation. He timely filed two documents, which I \nadmitted as AE E and F. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on March 12, 2010. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions to SOR allegations 1.a. through 1.f. are incorporated \nherein as findings of fact. After a thorough review of the pleadings, Applicant\u2019s response \nto the SOR, and the record evidence, I make the following additional findings of fact. \n \nApplicant, 40 years old, served in the National Guard from 1994 until 2000. He \nheld a security clearance without incident during that time. He is married and has five \nchildren. They range in age from 3 to 25 years old, and they live with Applicant and his \nwife.

However, he did not \ncomplete a degree because of lack of funds. He works in the information technology \nfield for a defense contractor. (GE 2; Tr. 19-23, 59) \n \nApplicant's wife handled the family\u2019s finances, and before 2005, their financial \nsituation was stable. (Tr. 39, 50) In about 2005, she started a small cleaning company. \nApplicant's oldest son also worked in the business. Initially, it did well and she had \ncontracts to clean six office buildings. However, the business struggled during 2006 and \n2007, and their debts started to become delinquent. It finally failed in 2008.

They were unable to keep up with their mortgage payments, and were \n \n2 Adjudication of this case is controlled by the Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) that were implemented by \nthe Department of Defense on September 1, 2006. The AG supersedea the guidelines listed in \nEnclosure 2 to the Directive, and they apply to all adjudications or trustworthiness determinations in \nwhich an SOR was issued on or after September 1, 2006. \n \n3 Applicant's Answer included five documents identified herein as Answer Documents (AD) 1\u2013creditor \nletter re allegation 1.d.; AD 2-creditor letter re allegation 1.c.; AD 3-creditor letter re allegation 1.f.; AD 4-\ncreditor letter re unalleged debt; AD 5-Applicant's credit bureau report dated November 9, 2009. \n\n \n \n3\nforced to sell their home in about 2006 or it would likely have been foreclosed. The \nfinancial situation put their marriage under great stress, and they almost divorced. \nApplicant testified that he will not be in a similar situation in the future because,  \n \nI can\u2019t go through it again. I told my wife, I spoke to her. I just can\u2019t do it. It \nwas the worst two years of my life. I get my house taken and I\u2019ve got five \nkids. And we had to move into a small house. Everything got taken from \nme because of the situation, and I just can\u2019t take it.  \n \nApplicant's wife turned over the family finances to Applicant. He sought advice from his \nmother, a billing manager who is familiar with working with creditors. He also created a \nwritten budget, which he currently follows. (Tr. 28, 41-43, 50-51) \n \nStarting in 2006, Applicant supported his wife\u2019s grandparents, and carried the \n$687 monthly payments on the grandparents\u2019 house. He supported them until 2008, \nwhen the grandfather passed away. At times, the grandparents lived with Applicant\u2019s \nfamily. His wife\u2019s grandmother is currently in a nursing home, and Applicant no longer \nsupports her. Applicant also cares for children through a foster-care program. Three of \ntheir five children are adoptees from foster care. (AE D; Tr. 27-29, 50) \n \nApplicant's annual income between 2006 and 2007 was $77,000. He was \nunemployed for approximately two months in 2007. He then obtained a contract that \npaid $50 per hour, or approximately $95,000 per year. However, he worked under that \ncontract for six only months, until March 2008 when he joined his current employer. (GE \n1; Tr. 29-30) His net monthly income in June 2009 was $9,000, which included his \nincome and foster-care payments of $2,400 per month. (Tr. 24) His monthly expenses \nwere $8,230, and debt payments were $240, leaving a net monthly remainder of $530. \nHis wife is not employed outside the home. Applicant and his wife each have a car, and \nthey have a van that his son used in the business. The monthly car payments total \n$1,900. One car loan, with a monthly payment of $562, will be paid off in July 2010 (Tr. \n43-45) He is also transferring his daughter from private school to public school, which \nwill eliminate a monthly payment of $893. (Tr. 45) Applicant is planning to move in May \n2010. As a result, his utility bill of $1,100 per month will drop to $700. Applicant currently \nhas one credit card with a balance of $138. He testified that he paid the debts without \nseeking bankruptcy protection. (GE 4; Tr. 14, 30, 34, 46-49) \n \nThe SOR debts total approximately $27,600, excluding duplicate allegation 1.e. \nThe status of Applicant's SOR debts follows. The government\u2019s evidence supporting \nthese debts appears in GE 6, 7 and 8, unless otherwise noted. \n \nAllegation 1.a. \u2013 credit card, $13,000 \u2013 PAYING. Applicant used the card for \nliving expenses, including the support of his wife\u2019s grandparents, and to purchase \nmachinery for his wife\u2019s business. He negotiated a settlement of $6,000 with the \ncreditor. He has paid $1,000, and will use his 2009 tax refund to pay the additional \n$5,000. (AE B, C; Tr. 27-29) \n\n \n \n4\n                                                \n \nAllegation 1.b. \u2013 student loan, $5,574 \u2013 PAYING. Applicant was paying $100 per \nmonth, until he could no longer afford the payments. Approximately 15 months ago, he \nrestarted the payment plan, and he has been paying $76 per month since then. After he \nsuccessfully paid for 11 consecutive months, the account was transferred to the current \ncreditor. (AE A; Tr. 32-34) \n \n \nAllegation 1.c. \u2013 credit card, $2,924 \u2013 PAID. Applicant used this credit card for \nhis wife\u2019s business and family living expenses. He provided documentation showing that \nhe settled the account for $662, and it is paid in full. (Answer Document (AD) 2; Tr. 35-\n36) \n \n \nAllegation 1.d. \u2013 student loan, $5,943 \u2013 PAID. In October 2009, Applicant \narranged for a settlement on this account of $2,000. He provided documentation \nshowing that he has paid the balance. (AD 1; AE E; Tr. 36-38) \n \n \nAllegation 1.e. \u2013 credit card \u2013 DUPLICATE. Applicant provided documentation \nfrom the creditor showing that this account was transferred to the creditor in allegation \n1.a. (AE C; Tr. 38-39) \n \n \nAllegation 1.f. \u2013 overdrawn account - $132 \u2013 PAID. Applicant paid this debt in full, \nand provided supporting documentation dated November 2009. (AD 3) \n \nPolicies \n \n \nEach security clearance decision must be a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndetermination based on examination of all available relevant and material information, \nand consideration of the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in the AG.4 Decisions \nmust also reflect consideration of the \u201cwhole person\u201d factors listed in \u00b6 2(a) of the \nGuidelines. \n \n \nThe presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not \ndeterminative of a conclusion for or against an Applicant. However, specific applicable \nguidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against them as they \nrepresent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to classified \ninformation. In this case, the pleadings and the information presented by the parties \nrequire consideration of the security concerns and adjudicative factors addressed under \nGuideline F (Financial Considerations).   \n \n \nA security clearance decision is intended only to resolve the questions of whether \nit is clearly consistent with the national interest5 for an applicant to either receive or \n \n4 Directive. 6.3. \n5 See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988). \n\n \n \n5\n                                                \ncontinue to have access to classified information. The government bears the initial \nburden of producing admissible information on which it based the preliminary decision \nto deny or revoke a security clearance for an applicant. Additionally, the government \nmust be able to prove controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If the government meets \nits burden, it then falls to the applicant to refute, extenuate or mitigate the government\u2019s \ncase. Because no one has a \u201cright\u201d to a security clearance, an applicant bears a heavy \nburden of persuasion.6 A person who has access to classified information enters into a \nfiduciary relationship with the government based on trust and confidence. Therefore, the \ngovernment has a compelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the \nrequisite judgment, reliability and trustworthiness of one who will protect the national \ninterests as his or his own. The \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard \ncompels resolution of any reasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in \nfavor of the government.7 \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F (Financial Considerations) \n \nAG \u00b6 18 expresses the security concern pertaining to financial considerations: \n \nFailure or inability to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially over-\nextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nCompulsive gambling is a concern as it may lead to financial crimes \nincluding espionage. Affluence that cannot be explained by known \nsources of income is also a security concern. It may indicate proceeds \nfrom financially profitable criminal acts. \n \n \nApplicant had good credit until 2005. However, his wife started a cleaning \nbusiness, which failed in 2008-2009. He used credit cards to finance her business and \nto pay living expenses. Disqualifying conditions AG \u00b6 19(a) (inability or unwillingness to \nsatisfy debts) and AG \u00b6 19(c) (a history of not meeting financial obligations) apply. The \nrecord contains no evidence of other disqualifying conditions such as frivolous \nspending, or debts related to alcoholism, gambling or deceptive practices.  \n \n \nThe Financial Considerations guideline also contains conditions that can \nmitigate security concerns. In this case, the following conditions are relevant: \n \n \n6 See Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, 531. \n7 See Egan; Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 2(b). \n\n \n \n6\n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), \nand \nthe \nindividual \nacted \nresponsibly \nunder \nthe \ncircumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control; and \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts. \n \n \nApplicant's delinquencies, which began in 2008, are recent, as they remained \ndelinquent until a short time ago. However, his delinquencies resulted from the failure \nof his wife\u2019s business, which is now defunct. Because of the family crisis resulting from \nthe failure, Applicant is unlikely to allow such a situation to recur. Applicant has paid \nfour of the six debts, and has an active payment plan in place for the remaining two, \nwhich reflects favorably on his current reliability and good judgment. AG \u00b6 20(a) \napplies. Although he did not attend formal counselling, he sought the advice of his \nmother, a billing manager. He also developed a written budget, which he continues to \nfollow. He has provided documentation supporting his payment claims. His financial \nproblems are under control, and AG \u00b6 20(c) and (d) also apply. \n \n \nApplicant had good credit before the business venture. The business initially did \nwell, and Applicant had no way to foresee its failure. Moreover, he made diligent efforts \nto pay his accounts as soon as he was reasonably able to do so, and he did not spend \nmoney in a negligent or frivolous manner. Applicant\u2019s situation and his response \nsupport application of AG \u00b6 20(b).  \n \n \nWhole-Person Analysis \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s security eligibility by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and \nall the circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative \nprocess factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \n\n \n \n7\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 2(c) requires that the ultimate determination of whether to grant a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Under the cited \nguideline, I considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of \nall the facts and circumstances surrounding this case.  \n \n \nApplicant has had significant expenses over the past several years. He has \nsupported five children through foster care, and adopted three of them. He also \nsupported two nephews and his wife\u2019s grandparents. His wife paid the family bills, and \nthey were able to maintain good credit. Initially, when his wife started a cleaning \nbusiness, it succeeded. However, when it began to fail, and brought on a crisis in the \nfamily. Ultimately, they lost their home. Over the past year-and-a-half, Applicant has \ntaken numerous steps to recover: he took over the family bills; will complete payments \non one car loan shortly; is moving to a less expensive house; and is moving one child \nto a public school. His actions allowed him to negotiate settlements with creditors, pay \noff four of the six SOR debts, and maintain a payment plan on the other two debts. \nApplicant has made significant improvements in his financial situation in the past 18 \nmonths. Applicant was also candid and forthright about his financial problems.  \n \n \nOverall, the record evidence satisfies the doubts raised about Applicant\u2019s \nsuitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant has \nmitigated the security concerns arising from the cited adjudicative guideline. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a. \u2013 1.f.  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to allow Applicant access to classified \ninformation.

Hess, Esquire, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Dawn M. Laubach, Esquire \n \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nDAM, Shari, Administrative Judge: \n \n \nBased upon a review of the record evidence as a whole, eligibility for access to \nclassified information is granted. \n \nOn December 2, 2008, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for \nInvestigation Processing (e-QIP). On September 18, 2009, the Defense Office of \nHearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant \ndetailing security concerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) and Guideline \nE (Personal Conduct). The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nAdjudicative Guidelines (AG) effective within the Department of Defense for SORs \nissued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on November 16, 2009, and requested a \nhearing before an administrative judge. On January 22, 2010, DOHA assigned the case \nApril 27, 2010\n\n \n \n \n \n2\nto me. On February 5, 2010, DOHA issued a Notice of Hearing setting the case for \nFebruary 24, 2010. The case was heard as scheduled.  Department Counsel offered \nGovernment Exhibits (GE) 1 through 7 into evidence without objection. Applicant \ntestified. She offered exhibits marked as Tabs 1 through 13 into evidence without \nobjection. DOHA received the hearing transcript on March 4, 2010.  The record \nremained open until March 15, 2010, to give Applicant an opportunity to submit \nadditional information.  On that day, Applicant submitted an exhibit that I marked as Tab \n14 and admitted into evidence without objection.                                                         \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn her Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted all of the allegations contained in \nSOR \u00b6 1, except those alleged in \u00b6 1.b, 1.g, and 1.o. She denied the allegations \ncontained in SOR \u00b6 2. She provided extensive information in support of her answers.  \n \n \nApplicant is 37-years-old, married, and has a five-year-old daughter. In March \n2002, she earned an associate\u2019s degree in information technology. She is completing a \nbachelor\u2019s degree in database administration. Her husband works for the airline \nindustry. \n \n \nIn April 2002, Applicant purchased a house with the assistance of her father. She \nand her husband (then fianc\u00e9) intended to rent the house for a year before getting \nmarried and moving into it. They planned to have the tenants\u2019 rent cover the mortgage \nand to use their salaries to pay other debts.  About two months after the tenants moved \ninto the house, they broke the lease and moved out. As a result, Applicant became \nresponsible for the mortgage. At the time, she had just finished her associate\u2019s degree \nand obtained a position as a help desk technician. Her $24,000 salary was insufficient \nto cover the mortgage and pay her bills.1 She decided to pay the mortgage and stopped \nmaking minimal payments on other bills, including credit cards. (Tr. 53.) In December \n2002, she and her husband married, and she moved into the house with her husband, \nwho had lived there since the tenants left. By January 2003, her debts started to \nbecome delinquent. (Tr.  64.)  \n \n \nIn November 2005, Applicant began working for federal contractors and earning \nabout $40,000 annually. By 2008, she and her husband had a combined income of \nslightly less than a $100,000. During 2009, she earned $89,000 as a database \nadministrator and her husband earned about $30,000 for a combined income of over \n$100,000. (Tr. 85-86.) They are financially stable and current with all of their expenses \nand obligations. (Tr. 54.) \n \n \n Subsequent to completing her first e-QIP, on December 12, 2008, Applicant met \nwith a government investigator to discuss her finances. During that meeting, she \nreviewed her credit bureau report (CBR) for the first time and learned of the number of \nreported delinquent debts. (Tr. 27.) About a month later, she sought credit counseling \n                                            \n1Prior to this position, Applicant worked as a Hospice care aide and earned $9,000 annually.  \n\n \n \n \n \n3\nwith a firm in order to resolve or consolidate the debts. A counselor with the firm advised \nher that they could not help her because the debts were too old. (Tr. 92.)  In March \n2009, she and her husband enrolled in a 13-week financial counseling course. (Tr. 91-\n93; Tab 14 at 7.). After finishing the course, she implemented techniques for \nresponsible financial management that she has continued to follow. (Tr. 57.) In October \n2009, she consulted with another consumer credit counseling service for assistance \nwith resolving her old debts. The counselor performed a financial analysis and \nestablished a suggested budget. He advised her to dispute all old debts listed on her \ncredit bureau reports in accordance with the applicable credit laws, which she did. (Tab \n10.) \n  \n \nBased on credit bureau reports (CBR) from October 2008, December 2008, and \nJuly 2009, the SOR alleged that Applicant accumulated 17 delinquent debts totaling \n$24,522. (GE 2, 3, 4.) The majority of the debts accrued between 2000 and 2004. The \nstatus of each debt is listed below: \n \n \nDebts Paid \n \n1. (\u00b6 1.a) The $134 debt was paid in November 2009. (Tab 1.)  \n \n2. (\u00b6 1.c) The $59 debt was paid in November 2009. (Tab 2.)   \n \n3. (\u00b6 1.q) The $319 debt was paid in October 2009. (Tab 3.) \n \n \nDebts Disputed \n \n4. (\u00b6 1.b) In October and November 2009, Applicant disputed the $602 debt \nowed to a credit card company, as not being her debt. (Tab 5.) A November \n2009 CBR noted the dispute. (Tab 9.) She denies owing the debt.  \n \n5. (\u00b6 1.g) In October 2009, Applicant disputed the $560 debt owed to a bank \ncredit card. (Tab 6.) In November 2009, the debt was deleted from the credit \nbureau reports. (Tab 6a.) \n \n6. (\u00b6 1.o) In October 2009, Applicant disputed the $3,710 debt alleged to be \nowed to a health club. (Tab 7.)  The debt does not appear on the February \n2010 credit bureau report. (Tab 9, 10a.) \n \n \nDebt Being Paid \n \n     7.  (\u00b6 1.i) The $1,786 debt is owed to the university which she attends. She was \nunaware of it until she reviewed her credit bureau report in December 2008. \nGenerally, the student loan carrier sent her tuition payments to the school. \nShe never received a bill for that unpaid amount. She started making $100 \nmonthly payments in February 2010. (Tr.  35; Tab 4a.)   \n \n\n \n \n \n \n4\n \n \n \nDebts Being Resolved \n \n8 -10. (\u00b6\u00b6 1.d, 1.e and 1.f)  These three alleged debts total $5,476 and are owed    \nto the same credit card company. In 2002, the delinquent debt was $685. \nApplicant\u2018s attorney recently located the current creditor. She thinks the debt \nwill be resolved for $205. (Tab 14 at 4.) \n \n11.  (\u00b6 1.h) The $464 debt is owed to a bank credit card.  She is willing to pay the \ndebt, but is unable to locate the current creditor. \n \n12. (\u00b6 1.j) The $2,262 debt is owed to a company for a computer she purchased \nin 2002 and returned when she could not afford the payments. In October \n2009, she wrote the computer company to inquire about the debt. (Tab 12.) \nShe is willing to pay the debt, but has not received a response from the \ncreditor. (Tr. 106.)  \n \n13. (\u00b6 1.k) The $1,165 debt is owed to a bank credit card. She sent a letter to the \ncreditor in October 2009, but did not receive a response. She is willing to pay \nthe debt, but is unable to resolve it. (Tr. 75; Tab 5a.)  \n \n 14-15. (\u00b6\u00b6 1.l, 1.m) These duplicate debts total $6,126. Applicant has attempted \nto resolve this debt since October 2009. (Tab 13.) Her attorney is unable to \nobtain the name of the current creditor, in order to resolve it. (Tab 14 at 5.)  \n \n16. (\u00b6 1.n) The $1,204 debt is owed to a department store. She is willing to pay \nthe debt, but is unable to locate the current owner of the debt. (Tr. 106.)  \n \n17. (\u00b6 1.p) The $655 debt is owed to a credit card company. She is willing to pay \nthe debt, but is unable to locate the current owner of the debt. (Tr. 50.) \n \n \nIn summary, Applicant has addressed or attempted to address each debt. She \npaid $512 to creditors, is paying the university bill of $1,786, and successfully disputed \n$4,872 of debt. She is willing to pay or resolve the remaining $17,300 debt if she \nreceives a response from the creditors to her letters. She submitted a copy of her \nbudget. Her family\u2019s net monthly income is $6,840. After paying expenses, she has \napproximately $2,100 remaining for other items and debt reduction. (Tab 10 at 10.) She \nsaves a large portion of that money. (Tr. at 83.)  \n \n \nSince working for federal contractors, Applicant has completed two public trust \napplications and one security clearance application. On November 13, 2007, Applicant \ncompleted her initial questionnaire for Public Trust Positions (SF-85P). In response to \n\u201cQuestion 22: Your Financial Record: b: Are you now over 180 days delinquent on any \nloan or financial obligation? Include loans or obligations funded or guaranteed by the \nFederal Government,\u201d she answered \u201cNo,\u201d and did not disclose the 17 debts listed in \n\n \n \n \n \n5\nthe SOR. On September 17, 2008, Applicant completed another SF-85P. In response to \n\u201cQuestion 22: Your Financial Record: b: Are you now over 180 days delinquent on any \nloan or financial obligation,\u201d she answered \u201cNo,\u201d and again did not disclose the 17 \ndebts. She interpreted the questions as seeking information about current debts and \nobligations, not old debts. (Tr. 31.) She did not know until her meeting with an \ninvestigator in December 2008 that she owed money to the university. (Tr. 34.) She \ndenied that she intentionally falsified the SF-85Ps. (Tr. 30-31.) Her explanation for the \nomissions is credible. \n \n \n \nOn December 2, 2008, Applicant\u2019s employer asked her to complete an e-QIP that \nsame day. She did not know that the application related to obtaining a secret security \nclearance or the significance of accurate disclosure. She thought it was required for \nupdating her records. She did not realize that she needed a credit report or other \nfinancial records available. (Tr. 73; GE 1) In response to \u201cSection 27: Financial Record \nb. In the last 7 years have you had your wages garnished or had any property \nrepossessed for any reason,\u201d she answered \u201cNo.\u201d She was unaware that a timeshare \nproperty, on which she stopped making payments in early 2000s because she could not \nafford the payments, became a repossession in July 2003.  She denied that she \nintentionally withheld that information from the Government. (Tr. 25-27; GE 5.) Her \nexplanation for the omission is credible. \n \n \nIn response to \u201cSection 28. Financial Delinquencies: Your Financial \nDelinquencies: a. In the last 7 years, have you been over 180 days delinquent on any \ndebt(s),\u201d and \u201cSection 28: b. Are you currently over 90 days delinquent on any debts(s),\u201d \nshe answered \u201cNo,\u201d and did not list the 17 delinquent debts alleged in the SOR. She \nknew that she had old debts, but did not think they fell within the seven-year time frame \nbecause she obtained a mortgage in 2002, which she knew required an acceptable \ncredit rating, and she had not received any information about the debts over the years. \nAs to debts delinquent more than 90 days, she again interpreted the question to inquire \ninto the status of current on-going obligations. She was not delinquent on those \nobligations. She denied that she intentionally withheld the information. She emphasized \nthat she did not have her credit report or financial records available when her employer \nasked her to complete the form in one day. (Tr. 29.) Her explanations for the omissions \nare credible.  \n \n \nApplicant was a candid and forthright witness. She demonstrated an in-depth \nknowledge about her financial situation and delinquent debts. She exhibited a strong \nsense of fiscal responsibility. She was remorseful about her unpaid earlier delinquent \ndebts, but asserted her commitment to living debt free and resolving her obligations.  \n \n  \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \n\n \n \n \n \n6\ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions, which are useful in evaluating an applicant\u2019s \neligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nAccording to Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to \nestablish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \n\u201capplicant is responsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, \nextenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel and \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \n \n A person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d  \n  \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG & 18:       \n \n\n \n \n \n \n7\nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \nAG \u00b6 19 describes two conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying: \n(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and \n (c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.  \nApplicant accumulated the majority of her delinquent debt between 2000 and \n2004, when she had insufficient money to pay them. In early 2009, she began to resolve \nthem. The evidence is sufficient to raise these potentially disqualifying conditions.  \nAfter \nthe \nGovernment \nproduced \nsubstantial \nevidence \nof \nthose \ntwo \ndisqualifications, the burden shifted to Applicant to produce evidence and prove a \nmitigating condition. AG \u00b6 20 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control; \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue; and, \n(f) the affluence resulted from a legal source of income. \n\n \n \n \n \n8\nThe bulk of Applicant\u2019s debts accumulated six to ten years ago, when she \npurchased a home that she intended to rent for a year. When her tenants left after two \nmonths instead of one year, she was unable to pay both the mortgage and previously \nincurred debts because of her limited income. As a result, she ceased paying older \ndebts, which then became delinquent. Given her present salary, those circumstances \nare unlikely to recur and do not cast doubt on her current judgment. AG \u00b6 20(a) applies.   \nSimilarly, AG \u00b6 20(b) has some application due to the unforeseen circumstances \nmentioned above. However, this mitigating condition has limited application because \nshe did not present any documentation to demonstrate that she attempted to manage \nthe debts until early 2009, after she learned of the Government\u2019s security concerns. \n \nApplicant presented evidence that shortly after learning of her delinquent debts \nshe sought credit counseling in early 2009. She participated in a 13-week financial \nplanning course and obtained additional credit counseling in October 2009. At this time, \nshe has paid three debts, is paying one of the debts, successfully disputed three debts, \nand has attempted to resolve the remaining ten debts with her attorney\u2019s assistance. \nThere are clear indications that the problem is being resolved and is under control, \nwarranting the application of AG \u00b6 20(c). Her payments to four creditors demonstrate a \ngood-faith effort to pay and resolve debts, and trigger the application of AG \u00b6 20(d). She \nis also willing to pay the outstanding debts, if she is able to locate the current creditor.   \n \nApplicant disputed numerous debts listed on her credit bureau reports. As a \nresult, at least three debts were deleted from recent credit bureau reports. She provided \nproof of those disputes, which is sufficient for the application of AG \u00b6 20(e). There is no \nevidence to support the application of AG \u00b6 20(f). \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \nThe security concern pertaining to the guideline for personal conduct is set out in \nAG \u00b6 15: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, \nor unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \nThe Government alleged in SOR \u00b6 2.a that Applicant falsified questions related \nto her delinquent debts on two SF-85Ps and an e-QIP; to wit, she failed to disclose a \ntimeshare repossession and debts that were more than 90 and 180 days delinquent. \nThe Government contended that those omissions may raise a security concern and be \ndisqualifying under AG \u00b6 16: \n \n\n \n \n \n \n9\n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \n \nApplicant denied that she intentionally omitted information about the delinquent \ndebts. When a falsification allegation is controverted or denied, the government has the \nburden of proving it.  An omission, standing alone, does not establish or prove an \napplicant\u2019s state of mind when the omission occurred. An administrative judge must \nconsider the record evidence as a whole to determine whether there is direct or \ncircumstantial evidence concerning an applicant\u2019s state of mind at the time the omission \noccurred. (See ISCR Case No. 03-09483 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 17, 2004) (explaining \nholding in ISCR Case No. 02-23133 at 5 (App. Bd. Jun. 9, 2004)) \n \n \nApplicant explained that she misinterpreted the questions on the SF-85Ps. She \nthought the questions inquired whether her current obligations were delinquent and not \nwhether she had ever had delinquent debts. After reviewing the language of the \nquestions, her explanations are credible. On the day that she was required to complete \nthe e-QIP, she did not have a CBR to review or her financial records. She was unaware \nof the importance of accuracy while filling out the form, and in fact, did not realize that it \nwas a security clearance application. At the time, she did not know that a previously \npurchased timeshare had become a repossession in 2003. Although she knew she had \nold debts, she did not think they fell within the seven-year timeframe, especially given \nthe knowledge that she obtained a mortgage in 2002. As to the debts older than 90 \ndays, she again misinterpreted the question as she had done in the SF-85Ps. Based on \nher demeanor and candor while testifying, her explanations are credible. The omission \nof the information may have been the result of a lack of diligence, but it was not \nintentional. Hence, the evidence did not establish deliberate falsification. The allegations \ncontained in SOR \u00b6 2 are found in her favor. \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a). They include the following:  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n\n \n \n \n \n10\n \n Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must include an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is a 37-year-old intelligent, \ncandid, and hard-working woman. She has successfully worked for federal contractors \nsince 2005 and within the last two years has obtained significant salary increases.   \nPrior to 2004, she accumulated delinquent debt that she chose not to address because \nof limited income and possible immaturity. After learning of the Government\u2019s concerns \nregarding her delinquent debts in December 2008, she obtained credit counseling and \nfinancial planning. She assumed responsibility for her debts and pursued resolution of \nthem. She is committed to financial solvency and established a budget that \naccommodates her goal. Based on the evidence and her testimony, it is unlikely that \nsimilar financial problems will recur, as she is aware of the negative effect that future \ndelinquencies will have on her eligibility to maintain a security clearance and retain her \nemployment. \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility \nand suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant \nmitigated the security concerns arising under financial considerations and personal \nconduct.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n FOR APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.q:  \n For Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \n FOR APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a through 2.d: \n \n For Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n                                  \n          \n \n \n \n_________________ \nSHARI DAM \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Hoffman, Esquire, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro Se \n \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nANTHONY, Joan Caton, Administrative Judge: \n \n \nAfter a thorough review of the case file, pleadings, testimony, and exhibits, I \nconclude that Applicant mitigated the government\u2019s security concerns under Guideline \nF, Financial Considerations.  Her eligibility for a security clearance is granted. \n \nApplicant signed a security clearance application (SF-86) on October 30, 2007, \nand she re-signed the SF-86 on August 28, 2009. On July 16, 2009, the Defense Office \nof Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) \ndetailing security concerns under Guideline F, Financial Considerations. The action was \ntaken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \n(February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the \nPresident on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for \nSORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nOn August 5, 2009, Applicant answered the SOR in writing. She elected to have \na hearing before an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on August 31, \nDecember 15, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n \n2009. A Notice of Hearing, setting Applicant\u2019s hearing for October 7, 2009, was issued \nSeptember 9, 2009. I convened the hearing as scheduled to consider whether it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for \nApplicant. \n \nThe Government called no witnesses and introduced seven exhibits, which were \nmarked Ex. 1 through 7 and admitted to the record without objection. Applicant testified \non her own behalf and called no witnesses. She introduced six exhibits, which were \nidentified and marked as Ex. A through Ex. F and admitted to the record without \nobjection.   \n \nAt the conclusion of the hearing, I left the record open until close of business on \nOctober 20, 2009, so that Applicant could, if she wished, provide additional information \nfor the record. Applicant timely filed 13 additional exhibits. Department Counsel did not \nobject to Applicant\u2019s post-hearing submissions. I marked the post-hearing submissions \nas Applicant\u2019s Ex. G through Ex. S, and they were admitted to the record. DOHA \nreceived the transcript (Tr.) of the hearing on October 15, 2009. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nThe SOR contains two allegations of disqualifying conduct under AG F, Financial \nConsiderations. Applicant admitted the two allegations and offered additional \ninformation. She denied that the allegations raised security concerns under AG F. \nApplicant\u2019s admissions are admitted as findings of fact. (SOR; Answer to SOR.)  \n \n \nApplicant is 39 years old and employed as a project manager by a government \ncontractor. She is married and the mother of an infant daughter. In 1992, she was \nawarded an associate of applied science degree in electronic technologies. She has \nheld a security clearance since 2002. Applicant\u2019s husband is a federal employee and \nalso holds a security clearance. (Ex. 1; Tr. 53-58.) \n \n \nIn addition to her work as a project manager, Applicant also owns a part-time \nbusiness which installs home security alarms and other electronic equipment in private \nhomes. She has owned the business since 2003. She carries out all work by herself, \nwith some help from her husband and her cousin. She estimated that in 2006, 2007, \nand 2008, she earned about $5,000 to $7,000 a year from her business. (Ex. 1; Tr. 59-\n60.)  \n \n \nBetween 1999 and 2001, Applicant was employed as a field service engineer in a \nsouthern state. She was single and had no children. She decided to invest some of her \nincome in rental properties in order to save money on her taxes. She bought three \nrental properties and successfully managed them. When she moved to take a job in \nanother state, she sold the three properties quickly and without difficulty. (Tr. 98-99.) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s skills and abilities enabled her to advance in her profession. She took \na position in a large metropolitan area, and, in 2003, she purchased a home secured by \n\n \n3 \n \n \n                                           \na mortgage for $344,000. Her monthly mortgage payment was $2,100. In addition, she \nacquired a home equity loan for $11,500 from a credit union. The home is the property \nidentified at SOR \u00b6 1.b. Applicant lived in the property until she married in September \n2007 and moved into a home owned by her husband. She provided her local taxing \nauthority with documents showing the property was no longer her personal residence \nand was being used as an investment property. After her marriage, she continued to \npay her mortgage on the property but sought a tenant. (SOR; Ex. 1; Ex. F; Ex. P; Tr. 75-\n78, 93-94, 100.)  \n \n \nIn 2006, Applicant purchased a second home, which she intended to rent as an \ninvestment property. She took out two mortgage loans to purchase the property. The \nmortgage payment on the second property was $2,800 a month. Soon after acquiring \nthe property, Applicant found a tenant, who paid $2,200 in monthly rent. Applicant\u2019s \ninvestment property is identified at SOR \u00b6 1.a. (SOR; Tr. 82-83.) \n \n \nIn September 2006, Applicant took a job as a technical security specialist with a \nfederal contractor. Her annual income from her job as a federal contractor was \napproximately $76,000 a year.1 Her employer asked her to identify and recommend \nadditional employees to carry out the company\u2019s contract work overseas. On December \n21, 2007, as Applicant went to discuss her proposed new hires with management, she \nhad good reason to think that her job was secure. However, at the meeting, there was \nno discussion of Applicant\u2019s recommendations. Instead, she was handed a letter telling \nher that her position as Senior Technical Survey Specialist had been eliminated in a \nheadquarters reduction in force, effective immediately. She was advised that she would \nreceive three weeks of severance pay. This management action came without warning \nand was a complete surprise to Applicant. (Ex. 1; Ex. A; Tr. 49, 60-65.) \n \n \nWhen she lost her job, Applicant had not yet found a tenant for the property that \nhad been her personal residence. Then, the tenant in her rental property lost her job in \nJanuary 2008. She continued to reside on the property until August 2008, but did not \npay rent after she lost her job. Applicant wrote to the tenant and requested that she pay \nher rent. The tenant responded by asking for more time. (Tr. 83-85.) \n \n \nApplicant found a tenant to rent her personal residence in March 2008. The \ntenant paid rent for the month of March 2008, and then paid nothing else. Applicant paid \na $3,000 electric bill that the tenant refused to pay. The tenant did not vacate the \nproperty until September 2008. (Tr. 79-81.) \n \n \nApplicant took preliminary action to evict one of her tenants, but she did not \nfollow through with eviction proceedings. She explained that she obtained the legal \npapers necessary to bring an action and then spent some time observing proceedings \nin landlord-tenant court. She observed that even when the judge found for the landlord, \ncollection of the debt was the responsibility of the landlord and was not assured. She \nconcluded that pursuing legal action against her two delinquent tenants would be costly \n \n1 In addition, she earned $5,000 to $7,000 annually from her own part-time business. \n\n \n4 \n \n \n                                           \nand was not practical in her situation. Instead, she focused her efforts on trying to sell \nthe two properties. (Tr. 81, 84-85.) \n \n \nWhen she lost her job in December 2007, Applicant had approximately $8,500 in \nher 401(K) plan and approximately $2,500 in her savings account. She used her \nseverance pay and drew money from her 401(K) and savings accounts to pay her two \nmortgages, which together totaled approximately $5,000 a month. She also used tax \nrefunds and drew money from her 401 (K) plan to make renovations and repairs to both \nproperties in order to improve their marketability. Applicant was able to pay her two \nmortgages in January and February 2008. She lacked sufficient funds to make the two \nmortgage payments in March 2008 and thereafter. (Tr. 86-90.) \n \n \nApplicant contacted her mortgage lenders and notified them of her job loss and \ninability to pay her mortgages. She learned from them and other lenders she consulted \nthat she was not eligible for federal assistance because both properties were used for \ninvestment and neither was used as her primary residence. Additionally, she learned \nthat to refinance an investment property, a borrower was required to put 20% down. \nShe concluded that she did not have enough money to refinance the properties. (Tr. 99-\n100.)    \n \n \nAfter losing her job in December 2007, Applicant obtained part-time intermittent \ncontract work at $13 an hour in February 2008, and, in 2008, she earned $22,000 from \nthis work. Additionally, In July and August 2008, she was hired by a company for a \ntemporary job that lasted three weeks. In September 2008, Applicant acquired her \npresent full-time position, with a yearly salary of $85,000.2 (Tr. 55-59, 134.)    \n \n \nThe SOR alleged at \u00b6 1.b. that Applicant was indebted to a mortgage lender in \nthe approximate amount of $344,000. SOR \u00b6 1.b. also alleged that the mortgage debt \nwas 120 days past due as of June 11, 2009, and that Applicant owed the lender \napproximately $35,981, which had not been paid. (SOR \u00b6 1.b.) \n \n \nAt her hearing, and in post-hearing submissions, Applicant provided credible \ntestimony and documentation to establish that, despite her efforts to arrange a short \nsale, the property had been foreclosed upon on May 22, 2009, the sale was ratified by \nthe circuit court on June 6, 2009, the ratification order was signed on September 18, \n2009, and she did not owe a balance or remainder on the loan. (Ex. E; Ex. Q; Tr. 91-\n93.) \n \n \nApplicant also provided documentation to corroborate her statement that she had \ncontacted the creditor from whom she had obtained the $11,500 home equity loan when \nshe purchased the property identified at SOR \u00b6 1.b. Applicant also provided \n \n2 At the time of her hearing, Applicant had been on unpaid maternity leave since July 31, 2009, because \nof complications in her pregnancy. She was planning to return to her full-time job on November 2, 2009.  \nBetween August and November 2009, she received payments from private disability insurance of \napproximately $5,800 every 42 days. In addition to her disability pay, she also received a net payment of \n$2,100 each month from her part-time contract work. (Ex. I; Tr. 118-121.) \n\n \n5 \n \n \n                                           \ndocumentation that established she had a payment plan in place on the home equity \nloan debt, was current on her payments, and owed a balance of $5,030. (Ex. F; Ex. P; \nTr. 37, 93-97.) \n \n \nThe SOR alleged at \u00b6 1.a. that Applicant was indebted to a mortgage lender in \nthe approximate amount of $222,000, and, as of June 11, 2009, the debt was over 120 \ndays past due and Applicant owed the lender approximately $29,488, which had not \nbeen paid. (SOR \u00b6 1.a.) \n \n \nAt her hearing, Applicant reported that the lender had delayed foreclosure of the \nproperty in order to permit her to execute a short sale, which was pending. The short \nsale offer was $162,000, and the deadline for completing the short sale was October 13, \n2009. If the short sale was completed, Applicant would owe nothing further on the debt.  \nIn a post-hearing submission, dated October 19, 2009, Applicant reported that the short \nsale had failed because the seller had refused the offer and opted out of the contract. \n(Ex. C; Ex. D; Ex. G; Tr. 68-73.)  \n \n \nAt her hearing, Applicant discussed her income and monthly budget. In a post-\nhearing submission, she provided a personal financial statement, based upon her \ndisability and part-time income during her pregnancy, which included her monthly \nexpenses and payment of debts. She reported a net monthly income of $5,393, total \nmonthly expenses of $3,658, and monthly payments on seven debts of $1,440.  She \nreported a net remainder each month of $295, savings of $1,000, 401(K) assets of \n$4,900, and a vehicle valued at $7,500. (Ex. H; Tr. 101-110.) \n \n \nApplicant reported that her husband\u2019s annual salary was approximately $92,000 \nand her annual salary from her employer was $85,000. Applicant also provided a \nmonthly household financial statement that included her husband\u2019s income and her \nregular income as well as their joint household expenses. The couple\u2019s net household \nmonthly income was $10,243.3 Their total joint monthly living expenses totaled $9,764. \nThese expenses included Applicant\u2019s car payment of $600 each month and $1,465 in \ncredit card payments. Their monthly net remainder was $480. (Ex. H; Ex. R; Tr. 134.) \n \n \nWhen credit card interest rates were about to be increased, Applicant closed four \nof her accounts in order to freeze the interest charged on the accounts. She is not \ndelinquent on these accounts, and she is making regular payments on them. She is also \npaying regularly each month on the home equity loan associated with the mortgage \nalleged at SOR \u00b6 1.b. She makes regular monthly payments on a time share purchase \nwith a balance of $9,320. The two mortgage delinquencies alleged on the SOR are her \nonly delinquent debts. ( Ex. J; Ex. K; Ex. L; Ex. M; Ex. N; Ex. O; Ex. P; Tr. 16-17, 47-\n48.)  \n \n \n \n \n3 Applicant\u2019s husband paid the monthly mortgage of $2,865 on their home. \n\n \n6 \n \n \n \n                                                 Policies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the \nExecutive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security, and \nit has emphasized that \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the \nNavy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the \nauthority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine \nwhether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information. Id. at \n527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.   \n  \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, an  \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, the administrative judge applies these guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR.

This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \n\n \n7 \n \n \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG & 18:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under \nAG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.  \nSimilarly under AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise \nsecurity concerns. Applicant accumulated substantial delinquent mortgage debt on two \ninvestment properties and was unable to pay her creditors. This evidence is sufficient to \nraise these two potentially disqualifying conditions. \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Several Guideline F mitigating conditions \ncould apply to the security concerns raised by Applicant\u2019s financial delinquencies. \nUnresolved financial delinquency might be mitigated if it \u201chappened so long ago, was so \ninfrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does \nnot cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d \n(AG \u00b6 20(a)) Additionally, unresolved financial delinquency might be mitigated if \u201cthe \nconditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s \ncontrol, (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical \nemergency, or a death, divorce, or separation), and the individual acted responsibly \nunder the circumstances.\u201d (AG \u00b6 20(b)) Still other mitigating circumstances that might \nbe applicable include evidence that \u201cthe person has received or is receiving counseling \nfor the problem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or \nis under control\u201d (AG \u00b6 20(c)) or \u201cthe individual has initiated a good-faith effort to repay \n\n \n8 \n \n \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.\u201d (AG \u00b6 20(d))  Finally, if \u201cthe individual has \na reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-due debt which is the cause of \nthe problem and provides documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or \nprovides evidence of options to resolve the issue,\u201d then AG \u00b6 20(e) might apply.  \n \nApplicant admitted financial delinquencies related to mortgage loans on \nproperties she purchased in 2003 and 2006. The delinquencies occurred after she was \nlaid off, without notice, from her job in December 2007. Soon thereafter, a tenant in one \nof her rental properties lost her job and was unable to pay her monthly rent to Applicant. \nThe tenant in her second rental property moved in, paid only one month\u2019s rent, and \nrefused to vacate the premises for six months. Applicant, who was herself unemployed, \nexhausted her savings in an attempt to pay the mortgages, but she was able to do so \nfor only two months, until February 2008. She contacted the mortgage lenders and tried \nto work out plans to renegotiate her mortgages. However, because they were \ninvestment properties, assistance plans for home mortgages were unavailable to her. \nShe persevered, upgraded the properties, and tried to sell them. When the mortgage \nlenders threatened foreclosure, she sought to negotiate short sales. Her efforts were not \nsuccessful. Eventually, one property was foreclosed upon, and a proposed short sale on \nthe second property fell through. \n \n Applicant is 39 years old. She is resourceful and entrepreneurial. She \nestablished her own part-time business to add to her income, and while she was \nunemployed, she sought out part-time contract work when full-time work was not \navailable to her. \n \n When Applicant lived in another community, she successfully invested in real \nestate, owed three properties, and was able to sell them without difficulty when she \nmoved to another location after accepting a new job. She attempted to repeat her \nsuccess in another region of the country but was caught in a severe downturn in the real \nestate market and, unfortunately, rented her properties to irresponsible tenants who did \nnot pay their rent. She has learned, through experience, some hard financial lessons. \nShe has also acknowledged her financial responsibilities and has made good-faith \nefforts to satisfy her creditors. Her financial record reflects reasonable risk-taking and \nresponsible financial behavior. She continues to try to resolve her financial obligations \nand to avoid repeating the same mistakes in the future. I conclude that AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), \n20(b), 20(c), and 20(d) apply in mitigation to the facts of Applicant\u2019s case. AG \u00b6 20(e) is \nnot relevant in this case. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n\n \n9 \n \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant possesses skills and \nabilities that have been valued by her employers. She has held a security clearance, \nwithout incident, since 2002. She is resourceful and has been successful in the \nsometimes uncertain world of government contractors. She purchased two houses as \ninvestment properties and took on two monthly mortgage payments that totaled \napproximately $5,000 each month. Her financial problems began when she was \nsummarily laid off, without notice and without cause, by her employer. Applicant \nresponded to this setback with energy and determination. She attempted to sell her \nproperties, and she continued to meet all of her other financial obligations. I observed \nApplicant carefully at her hearing, and I assessed her credibility. I have no doubt that \nshe will honor any legal financial obligations that arise from the ownership of her two \ninvestment properties. I believe it is highly unlikely that in the future she will fail to carry \nout any of the responsibilities of a person entrusted with a security clearance and the \nprotection of classified information. I conclude that she is not a security risk. \n \nApplicant is a serious and responsible person. She has shown good faith in \ncontacting her creditors and working with them to resolve or alleviate her indebtedness. \nShe is currently living within her means and paying attention to her financial obligations.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with no questions or doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s judgment and eligibility and suitability for a security clearance, and I \nconclude Applicant mitigated the security concerns arising under Guideline F, Financial \nConsiderations. \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n                    FOR  APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a. and 1.b.: \n         For Applicant \n \n\n \n10 \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it  is  \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n______________________ \nJoan Caton Anthony \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Nagel, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro se\nJune 14, 2011\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nMOGUL, Martin H., Administrative Judge:\nOn October 20, 2010, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under Guideline F\nfor Applicant. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines\n(AG), effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1,\n2006. \n \nOn November 16, 2010, Applicant replied to the SOR (RSOR) in writing, and he\ninitially requested a hearing based on the written record. Department Counsel thereafter\nrequested a hearing before an Administrative Judge. I received the case assignment on\nMarch 7, 2011. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on March 7, 2011, and I convened the\nhearing as scheduled on March 31, 2011. The Government offered Exhibits 1 through 6,\nwhich were received without objection. Applicant testified on his own behalf and\nsubmitted Exhibits A through E at the time of hearing, which were also admitted without\nobjection. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr) on April 8, 2011. I granted\n\n2\nApplicant\u2019s request to keep the record open until April 15, 2011, to submit additional\ndocuments, and one additional document that was received, has been identified and\nentered into evidence without objection as Exhibit F. Based upon a review of the\npleadings, exhibits, and the testimony of Applicant, eligibility for access to classified\ninformation is granted.\nFindings of Fact\nIn his RSOR, Applicant admitted both SOR allegations 1.a. and 1.b. The\nadmitted allegations are incorporated herein as findings of fact. \nAfter a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, including\nApplicant's RSOR, the admitted documents, and the testimony of Applicant, and upon\ndue consideration of that evidence, I make the following additional findings of fact: \nApplicant is 48 years old. He is currently unmarried, although he was married\nfrom 1985 to 1991, and again from 1993 to 2005, and he has one son. He served in the\nUnited States Air force from 1980 through 1984, and he received an Honorable\nDischarge. Applicant has held a security clearance for 29 years. He has been employed\nby the same defense contractor for 22 years, and he seeks a DoD security clearance in\nconnection with his employment in the defense sector.\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe SOR lists two allegations (1.a. and 1.b.) regarding overdue debts under\nAdjudicative Guideline F. As reviewed above, Applicant admitted both allegations in his\nRSOR.  The allegations will be discussed below as they were listed on the SOR:\n1.a. This overdue debt is cited in the SOR for real estate mortgage that was\nforeclosed for a delinquent account in the approximate amount of $296,000. (Tr at 54-\n57.)\n1.b. This overdue debt is cited in the SOR for an account that is past due in the\namount of $74,205.\nApplicant testified that these debts are for a home that he purchased as his\nprimary residence on December 12, 2005, for $371,000. He continued making his\nmonthly payments until May 1, 2008. Applicant stated that his house was in an area of\nthe country that was very severely affected by the housing crisis, and his house\ndepreciated by $200,000. The loan he used to purchase his home was 3/1 ARM, so that\nthe amount of the monthly payments for the loans would be fixed for three years, and\nthen the monthly payments would go up significantly after the three years. Applicant\nused two loans to purchase the house. The first loan was for 80% of the value of the\nhouse, and that is the basis for 1.a.  The second loan was for 20% of the value of the\nhouse, and that was to be considered for the down payment.  That loan is 1.b. on the\nSOR.\n\n3\nApplicant testified that he had been paying approximately $1,900 for the two\nloans, but the amount he was going to have to pay was significantly more, although at\nthe hearing he did not know what the amount of the payments was going to be. He also\nhad the financial problem of his fuel prices rising, since he lived far from his\nemployment, so that he was paying about $400 a month for fuel. Applicant could not sell\nhis house in a normal real estate transaction since it was valued at $200,000 less than\nhe paid for it. He considered renting out the house, but he learned that the rental market\nwas so weak that he would have received approximately $500 or $600 less each month\nthan what he would have to pay for the mortgage loans, which he could not afford with\nhe would have had to pay for rent for his living accommodations. He examined the\npossibility of a short sale, but he was informed  that if he was successful with a short\nsale, he would still be liable to pay taxes for what he failed to pay on the loan as taxable\nincome. (Tr at 28-31.)\nSince Applicant believed it was the most advantageous move he could make, he\nsimply stopped making payments on his loan on May 1, 2008. He immediately informed\nhis company\u2019s security department of his financial situation. He also immediately\nvacated the house on May 1, 2008, and rented an apartment closer to his employment\nsite. (Tr at 31-32.) Applicant testified that the house was sold at auction in February\n2009, and at least once more after that. He averred that he did not believe the creditors\nwere going to pursue him for any additional money, because he was informed that as\nlong as the loans in question were received at the time of purchase and never exceeded\nthe initial value of the home, then he would not be responsible for any additional money\nto the creditor if the home was foreclosed. The creditors have not made any further\nattempt to collect for any money owed. (Tr at 31-35.)\nApplicant averred that, with the exception of the two loans for the home\npurchase, he has been current on all of his other debts, both before and after the\npurchase and subsequent foreclosure of his home. He testified that he has never had a\ndebt in collection or charged off, never defaulted on any other loan, nor had a lien\nplaced against him or failed to file and pay his taxes. (Tr at 42-43.) Applicant\u2019s current\ngross income is  $108,000 a year, and his monthly expenditure for rent is $1,700 a\nmonth, which, he testified, he has no difficulty in paying. (Tr at 35-38.)  \nMitigation\nApplicant submitted two positive character letters. The first was from the Director\nof Security for Applicant\u2019s employer, who indicated that he has worked on and off with\nApplicant for more than 20 years. He wrote, \u201cAlong with my colleagues, I can attest that\n[Applicant] possesses the highest degree of integrity and follows the highest standards\nof professionalism. With the skill and commitment I witness from [Applicant] he has my\nfull and complete trust.\u201d The second letter was from his supervisor who has known\nApplicant for many years. He described Applicant as \u201chonest, reliable, and dedicated.\u201d\n(Exhibit A.) \nApplicant submitted documents showing that he received three company awards\nand commendations for his good work. (Exhibits B, C, D.) He also submitted his DD\n\n4\nForm 214, confirming that Applicant served in the United States Air Force from 1980 to\n1984 and received an Honorable Discharge. It also shows that he earned the Air Force\nTraining Ribbon, the Air Force Good Conduct Medal, the Air Force Longevity Service\nAward, and the Air Force Outstanding Unit Award.  (Exhibit E.)   \nFinally, in his post hearing submissions, Applicant forwarded his Performance\nEvaluation from his employer for 2010. His overall performance as to his objectives was\nrated, \u201cAll Achieved.\u201d He was described as \u201cdiligent and productive.\u201d  He also included a\nletter from a Contractor Special Security Officer of his employer, who wrote that\nApplicant\u2019s security records were reviewed as far back as they were available, and from\n1999 to the present, Applicant has had no security violations or incidents. (Exhibit F.)   \nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief\nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially\ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in evaluating an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c),\nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the\n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable\ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a\ndecision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\n\n5\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set\nout in AG \u00b6 18:  \n      Failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns and\ncould potentially apply in this case.  Under AG \u00b6 19 (a), \u201can inability or unwillingness to\nsatisfy debts\u201d is potentially disqualifying. Similarly under AG \u00b6 19 (c), \u201ca history of not\nmeeting financial obligations\u201d may raise security concerns. I find that both of these\ndisqualifying conditions apply to Applicant in this case. The evidence has established\nthat Applicant had accumulated significant delinquent debt. \nAG \u00b6 20 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns from financial\ndifficulties: Under AG \u00b6  20 (b), it may be mitigating where \u201cthe conditions that resulted\nin the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of\nemployment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce\nor separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.\u201d As noted\nabove, Applicant testified that his financial problems resulted from the financial\ndownturn that made his house worth $200,000 less than when he purchased it, and the\nsignificant increase in the amount he would be required to pay on his home loans.\nBecause of the decrease in value of the home, it could not be sold in a regular sale, nor\nwould renting the house allow Applicant to pay the mortgage loans and to pay for rent. If\nApplicant had made a short sale, he believed, based on information he received, that he\nwould still be liable to pay taxes for what he failed to pay on the loan as taxable income.\n \n\n6\nI find that Applicant has acted responsibly, since as soon as Applicant stopped\nmaking his monthly mortgage payments, he vacated the house, so that the bank could\ntake possession of  it and ultimately resell it, and  with the exception of the two loans for\nthe home purchase, he has been current on all of his other debts, both before and after\nthe purchase and subsequent foreclosure of his home. Applicant also informed his\nemployer\u2019s security officer of his financial difficulties. Therefore, I find that this mitigating\ncondition is a factor for consideration in this case. \nI conclude that Applicant acted reasonably and responsibly when faced with a\ndifficult, and unfortunately not uncommon, financial challenge. In all other financial\nareas, Applicant has and continues to maintain economic stability. Therefore, he has\nmitigated the financial concerns of the Government.\nWhole-Person Concept\nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nUnder AG \u00b6 2 (c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a\nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n  \nI considered the potentially Disqualifying and Mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case, including all of the reasons cited\nabove as to why the Mitigating Conditions apply. I then reviewed the positive character\nletters on behalf of Applicant, his excellent military and civilian employment history,\nincluding 22 years with his current employer, and no security violations noted in a\ncareer of holding a security clearance for almost 30 years. I find that the record\nevidence leaves me with no significant questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility\nand suitability for a security clearance under the whole-person concept. For all these\nreasons, I conclude Applicant has mitigated the security concerns. \n\n7\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a and 1.b.:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.

Accordingly, her request for a security \nclearance is denied. \n \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn September 28, 2008, Applicant submitted a Questionnaire for \nSensitive Positions (Standard Form 86) to request a security clearance required \nas part of her employment with a defense contractor. After reviewing the results \nof the ensuing background investigation, adjudicators for the Defense Office of \nHearings and Appeals (DOHA) were unable to make a preliminary affirmative \n \n 1  \nJanuary 28, 2010\n\n \n 2  \november 12, 2009. \n                                                     \nfinding1 that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s \nrequest.  \n \n \nOn July 14, 2009, DOHA issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons \n(SOR) that specified the basis for its decision: security concerns addressed in the \nDirective under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of the Revised \nAdjudicative Guidelines (AG).2 In her Answer to the SOR, signed and notarized \non August 10, 2009, Applicant denied all the allegations under Guideline F \nexcept subparagraphs 1.a., 1.f., and 1.k. She also requested a hearing before an \nadministrative judge.  \n \nDepartment Counsel was prepared to proceed on August 21, 2009 and \nthe case was assigned to me on August 29, 2009. DOHA issued a Notice of \nHearing on October 7, 2009, and I convened the hearing as scheduled on \nNovember 4, 2009. During the hearing, the government offered ten exhibits, \nmarked as Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 10,3 which were admitted \nwithout objection. Applicant testified, and offered two exhibits, admitted without \nobjection as Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AE) A and B. I held the record open for \nApplicant to submit additional documentation. She timely submitted four \ndocuments, admitted without objection as Applicant's Exhibit (AE) C through F. \nDOHA received the transcript on N\n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions in response to the SOR are admitted as fact. After \na thorough review of the pleadings, Applicant\u2019s response to the SOR, and the \nevidence presented by both parties, I make the following additional findings of \nfact. \n \n \n1  Required by Executive Order 10865, as amended, and by DoD Directive 5220.6 (Directive), as \namended. \n \n2 Adjudication of this case is controlled by the Revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG), approved by \nthe President on December 29, 2005, which were implemented by the Department of Defense on \nSeptember 1, 2006. The AG supersede the guidelines listed in Enclosure 2 to the Directive, and \nthey apply to all adjudications or trustworthiness determinations in which an SOR was issued on \nor after September 1, 2006. \n \n3 Applicant attached 128 pages to GE 4, her Interrogatory response. They were not assembled or \nmarked in relation to the SOR allegations. I have sorted the pages that appear to relate to a \nparticular allegation as follows: GE 4-1 (allegation 1.d.); GE 4-2 (allegations 1.f. and 1.k.); GE 4-3 \n(allegation 1.h.); GE 4-4 (allegation 1.i.); GE 4-5 (allegation 1.j.); GE 4-6 (allegation 1.l.); GE 4-7 \n(allegation 1.n.); GE 4-8 (allegation 1.p.). The response also included GE 4-9 (personal financial \nstatement); GE 4-10 (April 2009 credit bureau report); GE 4-11 (June 2005 credit bureau report); \nGE 4-12 (allegation 1.h.); GE 4-13 (2005 creditor letters regarding refunds); GE 4-14 (bank \nstatement); GE 4-15 (ex-husband\u2019s credit bureau report ); GE 4-16 (car repair documents); GE 4-\n17 (2002 letter from Better Business Bureau); GE 4-18 (blank credit report dispute form); GE 4-19 \n(2005 form letters from unknown company); GE 4-20 (DOHA Interrogatory of March 2009). \n\n \n 3  \n \nApplicant, who is 43 years old, completed some college credits but did not \nearn a degree. She is currently separated from her husband. She has a 27-year-\nold son, and a 25-year-old daughter who served in the U.S. Army for \napproximately three years. Neither of the children currently lives with Applicant, \nalthough Applicant has provided them with significant financial support. She has \nworked in the information technology field since the mid-1990s. She has worked \nfor a defense contractor since mid-2008, currently holding the position of \nsharepoint design developer. This is her first application for a security clearance \n(GE 1; Tr. 25-27, 63). \n \n \nApplicant testified that she has been financially insecure since she was \n16, when her first child was born and her first husband left. She attributes her \nfinancial problems to the need to support herself and her two children solely on \nher own income. Her children were born during her first marriage, and her \nsubsequent husbands would not contribute to the children\u2019s support. Working as \na contractor, Applicant had periods of unemployment in between contracts, \nincluding a few months in 2003 and a few months in 2007. Other than those \nperiods, Applicant has been employed for the past ten years. However, many of \nher jobs were brief, lasting only a few months. In 2000, she filed a Chapter 7 \nbankruptcy petition, which was discharged the same year. She has not sought \nfinancial counseling or worked with a debt consolidation service, and she does \nnot intend to file for bankruptcy (GE 1, 5, 6, 7, 8; Tr. 28-33, 53-58).  \n \n \nAfter taxes and deductions, Applicant earns monthly take-home pay of \napproximately $8,300, for an annual net income of approximately $99,000. \nAccording to her personal financial statement, Applicant\u2019s $7,256 monthly \nexpenses include rent, utilities, food, clothing, medical and household expenses. \nShe also listed a car loan of $954, and another unidentified loan of $1,149 per \nmonth. She spends about $200 per month on pet care and grooming. Applicant \nmakes credit card payments of $450 per month, and she testified that her credit \ncard payments have been up-to-date for years. Until about September 2009, she \nalso helped support her two adult children. In 2008, she provided them with \n$40,000, for an average of approximately $3,300 monthly. Applicant has about \n$200 in a checking account, does not have a savings account, and does not \ncontribute to a retirement plan. She reported a monthly net remainder of \napproximately $1,050. She plans to use her monthly remainders to buy a camper \nso that, if she is unemployed in the future, and/or has to move out-of-state for \nemployment, she could live in the camper (GE 4-9; Tr. 34-49; 51). \n \n \nThe 17 debts listed in the SOR accrued between 2003 and 2008, and total \nmore than $49,000. Each of the delinquent debts appears in Applicant's credit \nreports of November 2008 and January and June 2009 (GE 5, 6, 7). The status \nof the SOR debts follows. \n \n\u2022 \nJudgment: Allegations 1.b. $4,251 and 1.e. ($1,357). Applicant failed to \npay interest owed on a furniture purchase in 2007, and the company \n\n \n 4  \nprevailed in its suit (1.b.). She testified that the debt at allegation 1.e. is \nthe same debt ($1,357) before the interest, court costs and other fees \nwere added. She also stated that payments of $200 per month were \ngarnished from her salary, and the debt is paid. She did not provide \nevidence that it is paid, and the debt appears as delinquent in her \nNovember 2009 credit bureau report (GE 5, 6, 7; AE E; Tr. 60-62; 70-71).  \n \n$   \nRent: Allegations 1.c. ($10,570) and 1.l. ($10,570). In about 2005, \nApplicant rented a house for her daughter, who failed to pay the rent. She \nleft the house without notifying Applicant, who was unaware of the debt \nuntil her security interview. A judgment was filed against Applicant for \nunpaid rent. She has not paid the debt, and is uncertain about how she \nwill deal with it. She also testified that allegations 1.c. and 1.l., are the \nsame debt. Allegation 1.l. appears as delinquent in her November 2009 \ncredit bureau report (AE E; Tr. 62-66). \n \n\u2022 \nReturned Check: Allegation 1.d. ($70) relates to a fast-food purchase in \nOctober 2004. Applicant paid with a check that was returned for \ninsufficient funds. Although her current credit report shows an outstanding \ndebt of $70, she provided a money order receipt showing she paid the \namount requested by the merchant, $45. The receipt is dated December \n8, 2004 (GE 4-1, 5; Tr. 66-70). \n \n\u2022 \nCredit cards - Allegation 1.f. ($2,032) and 1.k. ($1,109). In 2003, \nApplicant\u2019s credit card was stolen. Applicant learned that the card had \nbeen used by the thief. She reported the theft to the police, and to the \ncredit card company, which closed the account. However, the company \nclaims that she then opened a new account. Applicant denies opening it, \nstating that the first name, maiden name, and address on the new \naccount are not hers; she never possessed a card for the new account; \nand someone else opened the account and used the card. She disputed \nthe new account with the issuing company by telephone, and with the \nthree credit reporting agencies. The evidence shows that the account in \nallegation 1.k. became delinquent in 2005, and was sold to a collection \nagency (GE 4-2, 5). In 2007, when the balance was $879, the agency \noffered Applicant a settlement (GE 4-2). She informed the agency that it \nwas not her account based on the incorrect name and address. Applicant \ntestified that these two allegations refer to the same credit card. However, \nthe accounts at allegations 1.f. and 1.k. have different account numbers. \nApplicant offered no documentation to support her dispute (GE 4-2, 5, 6; \nAE A; Tr. 71-78, 97-99). \n \n\u2022 \nRepossession: Allegation 1.g. ($3,086). Applicant was making \npayments on her car loan but, after the company changed ownership \nnumerous times, her payments were not credited. She contacted the \ncompany several times but was not told why her payments were not \n\n \n 5  \n                                                     \ncredited. She testified, \u201cWe just couldn\u2019t come to terms.\u201d In December \n2008, Applicant requested that the creditor take back her car. She has \nmade no payments since that time, and has not been contacted by the \ncreditor. Her November 2009 credit bureau report shows the delinquent \nbalance to be $10,020 (GE 5, 6, 7; AE E; Tr. 47-48, 78-81). \n \n\u2022 \nCredit card: Allegation 1.h. ($1,932) Applicant testified that this debt \nrelates to a bank credit card that was stolen in 2003.4 She reported the \nloss and continued to make payments on the balance in 2004 and 2005. \nHowever, she testified that the bank returned her checks because the \naccount did not exist. As Applicant offered copies only of the front sides of \nthe checks, it cannot be determined if the checks were mailed or cashed. \nThe debt was sold to a collection agency, which contacted Applicant in \nApril 2009 with a settlement offer; however, the debt remains delinquent \nin her November 2009 credit bureau report (GE 4-12; AE A, E; Tr. 81-89). \n \n$   \nCredit card: Allegation 1.i ($11,000) Applicant disputes this debt, which \nappears on her 2008 and 2009 credit bureau reports. When Applicant \ncalled the card issuer, she was informed the account was her husband\u2019s. \nThe document she provided states that her husband has an account with \nthe creditor, and she has no liability for the account. However, the account \nnumber for her husband\u2019s account (see AE C and GE 4-10) is not the \nsame as the account number for the account alleged at \u00b6 1.i. in the SOR. \nHer conversations and online disputes are undocumented (GE 5, 6, 7; AE \nB, C, E; Tr. 89-92). \n \n$  \nShort-term loan: Allegation 1.j. ($575). Applicant procured a loan of \n$500 in 2005. She supplied a document showing a payment of $575 in \nMay 2005, although the payee is not legible. However, the debt was sold \nto a collection agency, which contacted her in April 2009 to inform her that \nthey held the debt. She contacted the agency to say the debt was paid. \nShe provided in her Interrogatory response a copy of a check for $575 \ndated May 2005 (GE 4-5; Tr. 92- 95). \n \n$  \nCollection account: Allegation 1.m ($132). Applicant has no knowledge \nof this debt and has made no payments on it. She does not think she \ninvestigated or disputed it (GE 6; Tr. 101-103). \n \n$        Medical debt: Allegation 1.n. ($130) Applicant has no knowledge of this \ndebt, and has not disputed it with the credit reporting agencies (GE 6; Tr. \n103-105). \n \n \n4 Applicant did not claim that the debt in allegation 1.h. refers to the same stolen credit card as \nthe one discussed at allegations 1.f. and 1.k. The credit card issuer in 1.f. and 1.k. are the same, \nbut allegation 1.h. refers to a different creditor.  \n\n \n 6  \noncept. \n                                                     \n$    \nCredit card: Allegation 1.o. ($2,063). Applicant testified that she did not \nrecognize the account and that she called the company, which confirmed \nthat she did not have an account. Several days after the hearing, she \ncontacted the creditor to obtain information about the account, but she \nprovided no further information (GE 4; AE D, E; Tr. 106-108). \n \n$ \nVeterinarian: Allegation 1.p. ($126). In May 2009, Applicant attempted to \npay this bill for care of her daughter\u2019s cat. She provided documentation \nshowing that her check was returned (GE 6; AE B: Tr. 108-110). \n \n$  \nCollection account: Allegation 1.q. ($875). Applicant has made no \npayments on this debt, and does not recognize it. She has not contacted \nthe creditor or disputed it (GE 7; Tr. 111-112). \n \nPolicies \n \n \nEach security clearance decision must be a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense determination based on examination of all available relevant and \nmaterial information, and consideration of the pertinent criteria and adjudication \npolicy in the Revised AG.5 Decisions must also reflect consideration of the \nfactors listed in \u00b6 2(a) of the Guidelines, commonly referred to as the \u201cwhole \nperson\u201d c\n \n \nThe presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition does \nnot determine a conclusion for or against an applicant. However, specific \napplicable guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured \nagainst them as they represent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of \naccess to classified information. In this case, the pleadings and the information \npresented by the parties require consideration of the security concerns and \nadjudicative factors addressed under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) at \nAG \u00b6 18. \n \n \nA security clearance decision is intended only to resolve whether it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest6 for an applicant to either receive or \ncontinue to have access to classified information. The government bears the \ninitial burden of producing admissible information on which it based the \npreliminary decision to deny or revoke a security clearance for an applicant. \nAdditionally, the government must be able to prove controverted facts alleged in \nthe SOR. If the government meets its burden, it then falls to the applicant to \nrefute, extenuate, or mitigate the government\u2019s case.  \n \n \n5 Directive 6.3 \n \n6 See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988). \n \n\n \n 7  \n                                                     \n \nBecause no one has a \u201cright\u201d to a security clearance, an applicant bears a \nheavy burden of persuasion.7 A person who has access to classified information \nenters into a fiduciary relationship with the government based on trust and \nconfidence. Therefore, the government has a compelling interest in ensuring \neach applicant possesses the judgment, reliability and trustworthiness to protect \nthe national interests as her or her own. The \u201cclearly consistent with the national \ninterest\u201d standard compels resolution of any reasonable doubt about an \napplicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the government.8 \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \n \nAG \u00b6 18 expresses the security concern about financial considerations: \n \nFailure or inability to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and \nmeet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of \njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of \nwhich can raise questions about an individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. An \nindividual who is financially over-extended is at risk of having to \nengage in illegal acts to generate funds. Compulsive gambling is a \nconcern as it may lead to financial crimes including espionage. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is \nalso a security concern. It may indicate proceeds from financially \nprofitable criminal acts. \n \n \nThe evidence supports application of disqualifying conditions AG \u00b619 (a) \n(inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts) and AG \u00b619 (c) (a history of not \nmeeting financial obligations). Applicant owes more than $49,000 in delinquent \ndebt. Her debts became delinquent starting in 2003, and, but for three debts for \nwhich she provided proof of payment, they remain delinquent, indicating a history \nof failure to meet financial obligations. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 20, the following potentially mitigating factors are relevant: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were \nlargely beyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a \n \n7 See Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, 531. \n \n8 See Egan; Revised Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 2(b). \n\n \n 8  \nbusiness downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, \ndivorce or separation), and the individual acted responsibly \nunder the circumstances; \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue \ncreditors or otherwise resolve debts; \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the \nlegitimacy of the past-due debt which is the cause of the \nproblem and provides documented proof to substantiate the \nbasis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions to resolve \nthe issue. \n \n \nAlthough Applicant's debts have been accruing for several years, they are \nnot in the distant past, as they remain unpaid. The fact that most remain unpaid, \ndespite Applicant's substantial income, indicates that they may well remain \nunpaid in the future. Her failure to make consistent attempts to resolve her debts \nraises questions as to her reliability and judgment. AG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b) is relevant because Applicant had children at a very young \nage. Her first husband left her to support the children on her own, and her \nsubsequent husbands did not significantly help with her children\u2019s expenses. \nThese factors had an effect on her financial status and were beyond her control. \nHowever, these events occurred many years ago. Since that time, Applicant has \nreceived the benefit of a clean financial slate after her debts were discharged \nthrough a Chapter 7 bankruptcy in 2000. Nevertheless, and despite steady \nemployment and a substantial salary, Applicant has accrued a significant \ndelinquent debt load. AG \u00b6 20(b) does not apply. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d) requires a good-faith effort to resolve debts. Applicant was on \nnotice that delinquent debts were a security concern after she completed her \nsecurity clearance application in 2008, yet she has accomplished little in the \ninterim. She has not sought financial counseling. Although a few debts are paid, \nshe still owes more than $49,000, and her financial situation is not under control. \nWithout evidence of a plan to resolve indebtedness, and steps taken to \nimplement it, a good-faith effort to resolve debts cannot be substantiated. AG \u00b6 \n20(d) does not apply. \n \n \nApplicant disputes several debts, including \u00b6\u00b6 1.f., 1.i. and 1.k. She \nappears to have some grounds for disputing the credit card accounts related to \nthe card that was stolen. Applicant provided a letter from her ex-husband \nconfirming the theft. However, the mitigating condition also requires that an \nApplicant take steps to resolve the issue. Here, Applicant claimed that she \nreported the theft, but provided no documentary evidence that she reported the \ndispute to the creditor or credit reporting agencies. None of her credit bureau \n\n \n 9  \nreports note any disputed debts. Only partial mitigation is available under AG \u00b6 \n20(e). \n \n \nIn all, the partial mitigation available to Applicant under AG \u00b6 20(e) is \ninsufficient to outweigh the disqualifying conditions that apply. I find against \nApplicant  under Guideline F. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate \nthe Applicant\u2019s security eligibility by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the relevant circumstances. I have evaluated the facts presented \nand have applied the appropriate adjudicative factors under the cited guideline. I \nhave also reviewed the record before me in the context of the whole-person \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the \nextent to which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or \nabsence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; \n(7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of \ncontinuation or recurrence. \n \nAG \u00b6 2(c) requires that the ultimate determination of whether to grant a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based on careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. Under the \nappropriate guideline, I considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating \nconditions in light of all the facts and circumstances surrounding this case. \n \n \nAs Applicant was a mature adult of approximately 37 to 42 years old at the \ntime most of her debts became delinquent, her failure to respond to them cannot \nbe ascribed to immaturity or inexperience. She has not established payment \nplans, and but for three debts, she has not provided evidence that shows focused \nefforts to resolve her financial situation. An applicant is not required to be debt-\nfree, or establish that she paid every debt. But she must demonstrate that she \nestablished a plan to resolve her debts and has taken action to implement that \nplan. Here, Applicant has not established such a plan, and she still carries more \nthan $49,000 in debt, with no substantive efforts or reasonable plan to resolve it.  \n \nA fair and commonsense assessment of the available information bearing \non Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance shows she has not satisfied the \ndoubts currently raised about her suitability for a security clearance. For these \n\n \n \n10 \n \nreasons, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns arising \nfrom the cited adjudicative guideline. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by \nsection E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are as follows: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a. \u2013 1.c.  \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.d.  \n \nFor Applicant  \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.e. \u2013 1.i. \n \nAgainst Applicant  \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.j.  \n \nFor Applicant  \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.k. \u2013 1.o.  \nAgainst Applicant  \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.p.  \n \nFor Applicant  \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.q.  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the foregoing, it is not clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to allow applicant access to classified information.

Finding no error, we affirm.\nThe Judge found that Applicant had approximately $31,000 in delinquent debts, which were\ndischarged in a Chapter 7 bankruptcy in mid-2009.  The Judge acknowledged that the specific debts\nalleged in the SOR were no longer owed due to the bankruptcy.  She also acknowledged that\nApplicant\u2019s financial condition was affected by a job loss and pregnancy.  However, the Judge\nconcluded that Applicant had failed to mitigate the security concerns in her case.  Specifically, the\nJudge noted the paucity of record evidence explaining the reason for Applicant having amassed the\ndebts in the first place.   She also concluded that Applicant had not established a track record of\n1\nresponsible financial conduct, given the relative recency of the bankruptcy at  the close of the record.\nAfter reviewing the record, the Board concludes that the Judge examined the relevant data\nand articulated a satisfactory explanation for the decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between\nthe facts found and the choice made.\u2019\u201d  Motor Vehicle Mfrs.

The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and \neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on June 23, 2009, and elected to have \nher case decided on the written record. Department Counsel submitted the \ngovernment\u2019s file of relevant material (FORM) on July 14, 2009. The FORM was mailed \n \n1 \n \n \nOctober 8, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n \n                                                          \nto Applicant on July 15, 2009, and it was received on July 20, 2009. Applicant was \nafforded an opportunity to file objections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, \nor mitigation. Applicant provided additional information on July 30, 2009. Department \nCounsel had no objections to the additional information. The case was assigned to me \non September 16, 2009.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant denied all of the allegations in the SOR except \u00b6 1.a. After a thorough \nand careful review of the pleadings, exhibits, and statements submitted, I make the \nfollowing findings of fact. \n \n \nApplicant is 35 years old and began employment with a federal contractor in \nSeptember 2008. She stated in her response to the FORM that she was currently \nunemployed due to certain testing being done on a project by her employer. She was \nreceiving unemployment benefits and was looking for new employment with the same \ncontractor or a different government contractor. She married in 1993 and divorced in \n1997. She has a daughter from her first marriage. She remarried in 2002 and has a son.  \n \n \nApplicant was laid off from her job in January 2007, and remained unemployed \nuntil February 2008. She was pregnant at the time and her son was born in March 2007.  \n \n \nIn May 2009, Applicant and her husband had approximately $31,000 in \ndelinquent debt discharged in bankruptcy under Chapter 7. The debts included in SOR \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.b through 1.p were discharged in bankruptcy.1 Applicant explained that she and \nher husband attempted to address their debts through a debt consolidation program in \nOctober 2006. In her response, she stated they were making monthly payments, but the \ndebt consolidation company was charging more than the original creditors were \ncharging.2 She stated the consolidation company was not applying their payments \ntoward the debts. She then lost her job, and because she was pregnant, she had \ndifficulty finding employment. She received unemployment compensation for six months \nuntil it ran out in August 2007. She worked part-time at a store beginning in February \n2008 until September 2008, when she was hired by her current employer.  \n \n \nApplicant stated in her security clearance application (SCA) dated November 10, \n2008, that she owed approximately $5,100 for a student loan. She stated she had an \nagreement with the creditor to pay $68 a month that was to be paid by auto-draft from \nher account. In her response to the FORM dated July 26, 2009, she stated she set up \nan agreement with the student loan collection company to pay $50 a month beginning \non July 1, 2009, and make a second payment on July 2, 2009; thereafter payments \nwould be $50 a month. After nine consecutive payments the loan will be taken out of \n \n1 Response to FORM. \n \n2 Applicant did not provide any supporting documents to verify her debt consolidation program. \n\n \n3 \n \n \n                                                          \ndefault status and considered rehabilitated. It appears Applicant did not follow through \non her promise to begin paying her student loan debt in November 2008.3  \n \n \nApplicant did not explain why she incurred such a large amount of consumer \ndebts. The debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.o is for $11,747. No information was provided \nregarding this debt.  \n \n \nApplicant provided a printout summary of certain monthly expenditures and \ndeposits. It is unclear if this list includes all expenses. It is noted she has a car, but \ninsurance and gas for the car are not included. She does not include clothing or other \nhousehold expenses, including those incurred by her husband. It is also unclear if she \nhas medical insurance or other out-of-pocket medical expenses, or any expenses \nassociated with her children, other than day care.   \n \n \nApplicant received financial counseling as required for bankruptcy. She did not \nprovide information about whether she has received additional financial counseling. She \nand her husband currently do not have any credit cards.  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \n \n3 Applicant\u2019s student loan debt was not alleged in the SOR and will not be considered for \ndisqualifying purposes. It will be considered when analyzing the \u201cwhole person.\u201d \n\n \n4 \n \n \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG & 18:  \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. I have \nconsidered all of them under AG & 19 and especially considered the following: \n \n(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.  \n \nApplicant had $31,000 in delinquent debts discharged in bankruptcy in May \n2009. I find both disqualifying conditions have been raised.  \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. I have considered all of the mitigating \nconditions under AG \u00b6 20 and especially considering the following: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control; and \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts.  \n \n \nApplicant was having financial difficulties before October 2006, when she set up \na plan to consolidate her debts for repayment. She stated she made payments, and she \nbelieved they were not being applied properly. She also stated she was paying more to \nthe consolidator than she had been paying to her creditors. She did not provide any \nsupporting evidence of a debt consolidation plan or the terms of the plan. It is clear she \nwas having financial problems before she was laid off from work in January 2007. Her \nunemployment status exacerbated her already fragile financial situation. She was \npregnant at the time and was unemployed for a period of time. I find that because \nApplicant\u2019s debts have been discharged in bankruptcy she no longer owes them. \nBankruptcy is a legitimate and legal means for resolving debts. However, when \naddressing security concerns, it is imperative to look beyond the bankruptcy discharge \nand address the issues and reasons why Applicant accumulated debts and why she did \nnot pay them. I do not have sufficient evidence to analyze the reasons why Applicant \nincurred so much consumer debt and why she could not pay it when she was employed. \nWithout amplifying information, it is difficult to determine if she was acting responsibly \ntoward her debts before her loss of employment.  \n \n \nApplicant provided a computer summary of her income and monthly payments. I \nam unable to determine if all of her expenses are included in this plan. It is unclear how \nlong she has been using this plan. Applicant appears to be trying to get back on track \nfinancially and live within her means. I am concerned that she promised to make \npayments toward her student loans when she filled out her SCA in November 2008, and \nstated an automatic withdrawal would be made. She did not provide proof that she \nmade any of those promised payments. Instead, she provided an agreement from July \n2009 that shows that she will make monthly payments of $50 toward her student loans. \n\n \n6 \n \n \nIt appears she did not make the payments as promised in November 2008. I have \nconsidered this information regarding Applicant\u2019s reliability and good-faith effort to repay \nher creditors. Applicant may be on the road to financial recovery, but too little \ninformation was provided and it is too soon to make that determination.  \n \n \nI find mitigating condition (a) does not apply because Applicant\u2019s debts have only \nrecently been discharged in bankruptcy and she has not had a sufficient period of time \nto show she is being financially responsible. In addition, Applicant failed to explain how \nshe incurred such a large amount of consumer debt, so I am unable to conclude the \ncircumstances are unlikely to recur. I find mitigating condition (b) partially applies \nbecause Applicant\u2019s unemployment and difficulty in finding a job while pregnant and \nafter she had her baby were conditions beyond her control. The question remains \nregarding when she first started experiencing financial problems. It appears that she \nwas already having difficulty paying her bills before she was laid off. Without specific \ninformation, I am unable to conclude she acted responsibly under the circumstances. \nApplicant has resolved her delinquent debts through bankruptcy. She received the \nfinancial counseling that is mandatory for bankruptcy filers. I do give Applicant credit for \nestablishing a summary of her income and expenses. I find mitigating conditions (c) and \n(d) apply. I find mitigating condition (d) applies. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n  \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant was experiencing financial \nproblems in October 2006, before losing her job. When she lost her job and was \nunemployed for a period of time it exacerbated her financial problems. She incurred \nmore than $31,000 in consumer debt. She did not provide details regarding the specifics \nof her debts. She provided information regarding how she is keeping track of her \n\n \n7 \n \n \nfinances, but it is unclear if it is a complete budget. It has only been five months since \nApplicant had her debts discharged in bankruptcy. It is too soon to make a \ndetermination that Applicant has changed her financial situation, is living within her \nmeans, and is consistently paying her debts on time. Applicant has the burden of \npersuasion to show she has mitigated the government\u2019s security concerns. She has not \nmet that burden. Overall the record evidence leaves me with serious questions and \ndoubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these \nreasons, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns arising under the \nguideline for Financial Considerations.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b-1.o: \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

Duffy, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nMALONE, Matthew E., Administrative Judge:\nBased upon a review of the pleadings, the Government\u2019s exhibits (Gx.),\nApplicant\u2019s exhibits (Ax.), and Applicant\u2019s testimony, his request for a security clearance\nis granted.\nOn January 2, 2007, Applicant submitted a Questionnaire for Investigation\nProcessing (e-QIP) to renew a security clearance required for his job with a defense\ncontractor. After reviewing the results of the ensuing background investigation,\nadjudicators for the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued Applicant a\nset of written interrogatories  to clarify or augment information about potentially\n1\ndisqualifying information in his background. After reviewing the results of the\nbackground investigation and Applicant\u2019s response to the interrogatories, DOHA\nMay 28, 2010\n\n Required by Executive Order 10865, as amended, and by DoD Directive 5220.6 (Directive), as amended.\n2\n The adjudicative guidelines were implemented by the Department of Defense on September 1, 2006.\n3\nPending official revision of the Directive, they take precedence over the guidelines listed in Enclosure 2 to the\nDirective.\n Identified in the transcript at pp. 15 - 20.\n4\n2\nadjudicators were unable to make a preliminary affirmative finding  that it is clearly\n2\nconsistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s request for access to classified\ninformation. On October 9, 2009, DOHA issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons\n(SOR) alleging facts which, if proven, raise security concerns addressed in the\nadjudicative guidelines (AG)  for personal conduct (Guideline E) and misuse of\n3\ninformation technology systems (Guideline M). \nApplicant timely responded to the SOR and requested a hearing. The case was\nassigned to me on February 5, 2010. Pursuant to a Notice of Hearing issued the same\nday, I convened a hearing on February 25, 2010, at which the parties appeared as\nscheduled. The Government presented five evidentiary exhibits included in the record\nwithout objection as Gx. 1 - 5. The Government also proffered two documents for\npurposes of administrative notice, which were included in the record as Gx. 6 and 7.4\nApplicant testified and presented one witness. The record closed on March 8, 2010,\nwhen I received Applicant\u2019s post-hearing submission, which has been admitted without\nobjection as Applicant\u2019s Exhibit (Ax.) A. DOHA received the transcript of hearing (Tr.) on\nMarch 9, 2010.\nFindings of Fact\nThe Government alleged under Guideline M, that, while Applicant was working as\nan Information Assurance Officer for a defense contractor at a major military installation\nin February 2008, he intentionally deleted the network account of a person working at\nthat installation. It was further alleged that he did so on two separate occasions and that\nhe was fired for his actions. (SOR 1.a) Under Guideline E, the Government cross-\nalleged the conduct described in SOR 1.a as adverse personal conduct. (SOR 2.a)\nIn response to the SOR, Applicant admitted that he deleted the account as\nalleged, but he denied any malicious intent and denied that he was fired for his conduct.\nApplicant averred that he resigned his position and accepted employment with another\ncompany doing business at the same installation. In addition to the admissions of fact\ncontained in Applicant\u2019s answer, I make the following additional findings of relevant fact.\nApplicant is 46 years old. He served in the United States Army, primarily in\ninfantry assignments, from November 1982 until he retired as a Sergeant First Class\n(paygrade E-7) in March 2005. He and his wife have been married since May 1985.\nThey have three children, ages 18, 17, and 10. Applicant has held a security clearance\nfor about 30 years. (Gx. 1)\n\n3\nOne of Applicant\u2019s last active duty assignments in the Army required that he\nlearn the principles of information assurance and information systems security. In\nNovember 2004, he completed an Army Information Assurance Security Officer\nCertification Course. In August 2005, as a civilian, he completed an Army System\nAdministrator Security Course and a Network Manager Security Course. (Tr. 58 - 59;\nGx. 5)\nAfter retiring, Applicant went to work for a defense contractor as an Information\nSecurity Officer, but left that job in mid-2007 and worked independently doing IT\nsystems installations and other consulting work. In October 2006, he had been\nappointed as an Information Assurance Security Officer (IASO) by the Army Colonel\nwho was the deputy director of the command where Applicant was working. (Gx. 4) In\nDecember 2007, he was hired by another defense contractor at the same Army\ninstallation he had worked before as an Information Assurance Officer. He managed,\ntrained, and inspected constituents at that installation. He was also responsible for\nensuring his constituents were properly accredited to use their assigned information\nsystems. (Tr. 37 - 38) Accordingly, his duties required that he have privileged access to\nmost aspects of the information systems for which his organization was responsible.\nArmy Regulation (AR) 380-19 governs Information Systems Security throughout the\nDepartment of the Army (Gx. 7). Information Assurance at Applicant\u2019s job site was\ngoverned by a Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) established in November 2006\n(Gx. 6). In December 2006, Applicant read and signed a \u201cNetwork Privileged Access\nAgreement and Acknowledgment of Responsibilities\u201d form that detailed specific actions,\nboth required and prohibited, for his position. (Gx. 5)\nOn February 6, 2008, Applicant deleted the unclassified user account of a former\nco-worker at his previous defense contractor job. Applicant explained that he was\n\u201cmessing around\u201d (Gx. 3) with the system and did not realize he could actually delete\nsomeone\u2019s account. The person whose account was deleted called the Help Desk and\nhis account was restored. On February 8, 2008, Applicant again deleted the same\nperson\u2019s unclassified user account. This time, in response to his Help Desk call, an\ninvestigation was conducted that identified Applicant\u2019s workstation as the source of the\ndeletion. That same day, Applicant resigned his position in lieu of being fired. (Answer\nto SOR; Gx. 2)\nWhen Applicant was asked why he had chosen to delete a particular account, he\nexplained that the former co-worker occupied the position that Applicant had held eight\nmonths earlier when he worked for that company. That person had been calling\nApplicant several times each day about what Applicant felt were mundane issues his\nformer co-worker should have been able to resolve on his own. Applicant knew what the\njob required and could not understand why his former co-worker was bothering him with\nsuch questions. Although the first incident was a lark, Applicant admitted that he had\nbecome somewhat exasperated and the second incident was more of an attempt to\nharass the other person. (Tr. 51 - 53) No information, sensitive or otherwise, was lost as\na result of Applicant\u2019s actions. The information system involved was not compromised in\nany way by Applicant\u2019s actions, but the user affected was unable to access the system\nfor a brief period on the two days in question. \n\n Directive. 6.3.\n5\n4\nAfter he resigned, Applicant worked two jobs \u2013 at a department store and as a\nsmall arms instructor \u2013 to support his family. He was hired as an analyst by his current\nemployer, a defense contractor engaged in logistics support for the Army, in September\n2008. \nApplicant\u2019s service in the Army was exemplary. His list of awards and\ndecorations includes a Meritorious Service Medal, three Army Commendation Medals,\nfive Army Achievement Medals, seven Army Good Conduct Medals, a Bronze Star, and\na Combat Infantry Badge for deployment to Operation Just Cause in 1989. Applicant\ncompleted virtually every infantry training and combat skills course in the Army, served\nas a Drill Sergeant, and is a graduate of the Advanced Noncommissioned Officer\nCourse. His performance evaluations in the Army were superior, as were his initial\ncivilian on-the-job evaluations. He and his wife have long been active in their church and\nas volunteers for the House of Heroes, a non-profit organization that helps veterans and\npublic safety personnel, who are disabled, living on a fixed income, or facing other\nphysical or financial challenges, to renovate or repair their homes. These efforts are\nfunded entirely from charitable donations and organized by volunteers such as\nApplicant and his wife. Applicant enjoys a solid reputation in the community for his\nintegrity, hard work, and reliability. (Ax. A; Tr. 22 - 27)\nPolicies\nEach security clearance decision must be a fair, impartial, and commonsense\ndetermination based on examination of all available relevant and material information,5\nand consideration of the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in the adjudicative\nguidelines (AG). Decisions must also reflect consideration of the factors listed in \u00b6 2(a)\nof the new guidelines. Commonly referred to as the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept, those\nfactors are:\n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nThe presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not\ndeterminative of a conclusion for or against an applicant. However, specific applicable\nguidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against them as they\nrepresent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to classified\ninformation. In this case, the pleadings and the information presented by the parties\nrequire consideration of the security concerns and adjudicative factors addressed under\n\n See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988).\n6\n See Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, 531.\n7\n See Egan; Revised Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 2(b).\n8\n5\nAG \u00b6 15 (Guideline E - Personal Conduct) and AG \u00b6 39 (Guideline M - Use of\nInformation Technology Systems).\nA security clearance decision is intended to resolve whether it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest  for an applicant to either receive or continue to\n6\nhave access to classified information. The Government bears the initial burden of\nproducing admissible information on which it based the preliminary decision to deny or\nrevoke a security clearance for an applicant. Additionally, the Government must be able\nto prove controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If the Government meets its burden, it\nthen falls to the applicant to refute, extenuate or mitigate the Government\u2019s case.\nBecause no one has a \u201cright\u201d to a security clearance, an applicant bears a heavy\nburden of persuasion.  \n7\nA person who has access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government based on trust and confidence. Thus, the Government\nhas a compelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgment,\nreliability and trustworthiness of one who will protect the national interests as his or her\nown. The \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of\nany reasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the\nGovernment.8\nAnalysis\nUse of Information Technology Systems\nThe Government presented sufficient information to support the allegation in\nSOR \u00b6 1.a. Using his privileged system access as an IASO, Applicant intentionally, but\nwithout authorization or other valid reason, deleted a co-worker\u2019s user account on an\nunclassified information of a co-worker if proved, would raise a security concern\naddressed in AG \u00b6 39 as follows: \nNoncompliance with rules, procedures, guidelines or regulations pertaining\nto information technology systems may raise security concerns about an\nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, calling into question the\nwillingness or ability to properly protect sensitive systems, networks, and\ninformation. Information Technology Systems include all related  computer\nhardware, software, firmware, and data used for the communication,\ntransmission, processing, manipulation, storage, or protection of\ninformation.\nThe facts and circumstances of this case require application of the disqualifying\ncondition listed at AG \u00b6 40(b) (illegal or unauthorized modification, destruction,\n\n6\nmanipulation or denial of access to information, software, firmware, or hardware in an\ninformation technology system). Applicant\u2019s actions on two occasions in February 2008\nclearly denied a co-worker the use of an unclassified system he needed to do his job.\nAs to AG \u00b6 40(a) (illegal or unauthorized entry into any information technology\nsystem or component thereof), this disqualifying condition does not apply because\nApplicant\u2019s access was legitimate and consistent with his assigned duties. However, AG\n\u00b6 40(e) (unauthorized use of a government or other information technology system),\napplies because he was not authorized to use the system as he did on the occasions at\nissue.\nThe disqualifying conditions at AG \u00b6 40(c) (use of any information technology\nsystem to gain unauthorized access to another system or to a compartmented area\nwithin the same system); AG \u00b6 40(d) (downloading, storing, or transmitting classified\ninformation on or to any unauthorized software, hardware, or information technology\nsystem); AG \u00b6 40(g) (negligence or lax security habits in handling information\ntechnology that persist despite counseling by management), and AG \u00b6 40(f)\n(introduction, removal, or duplication of hardware, firmware, software, or media to or\nfrom any information technology system without authorization, when prohibited by rules,\nprocedures, guidelines or regulations) do not apply based on the facts presented.\nFinally, AG \u00b6 40(h) (any misuse of information technology, whether deliberate or\nnegligent, that results in damage to the national security) does not apply because it was\nnot established that any classified information was involved or that the denial of the\nuser\u2019s access to his account had any impact on national security. \nApplicant has acknowledged the gravity of his conduct, and the record clearly\nshows that he violated a position of trust, and that he had no valid reason for doing what\nhe did. Accordingly, AG \u00b6 41(b) (the misuse was minor and done only in the interest of\norganizational efficiency and effectiveness, such as letting another person use one's\npassword or computer when no other timely alternative was readily available) does not\napply. The mitigating condition at AG \u00b6 41(c) (the conduct was unintentional or\ninadvertent and was followed by a prompt, good-faith effort to correct the situation and\nby notification of supervisor) does not apply because his conduct was deliberate and he\ndid not act to correct it before he was confronted by his supervisors. \nBy contrast, the record as a whole supports the mitigating condition at AG \u00b6\n41(a) (so much time has elapsed since the behavior happened, or it happened under\nsuch unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on the\nindividual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment). This isolated event occurred\nmore than two years ago. In light of all of the available information about Applicant\u2019s\nmilitary career and his civilian job performance, his conduct in this regard was an\naberration. Further, he no longer works as an IASO and is unlikely to seek such a\nposition in the future. On balance, I conclude that available information is sufficient to\nmitigate the security concerns raised by Applicant\u2019s misuse of the information\ntechnology system in question. \n\n7\nPersonal Conduct\nThe Government also alleged that Applicant\u2019s misuse of technology is\ndisqualifying as adverse personal conduct under Guideline E. (SOR 2.a) This security\nconcern is expressed at AG \u00b6 15 as follows:\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful\nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other\nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\nThese facts raise the potential applicability of the disqualifying conditions at AG \u00b6\n16(c) (credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is not\nsufficient for an adverse determination under any other single guideline, but which,\nwhen considered as a whole, supports a whole-person assessment of questionable\njudgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with\nrules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the person may not\nproperly safeguard protected information); AG \u00b6 16(d) (credible adverse information that\nis not explicitly covered under any other guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for\nan adverse determination, but which, when combined with all available information\nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness,\nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other\ncharacteristics indicating that the person may not properly safeguard protected\ninformation. This includes but is not limited to consideration of...(4) evidence of\nsignificant misuse of government or other employer's time or resources); and AG \u00b6 16(f)\n(violation of a written or recorded commitment made by the individual to the employer\nas a condition of employment). \nAs to AG \u00b6 16(f), Applicant signed an agreement to not misuse his position as an\nIASO with privileged access. He also acknowledged his responsibilities to protect the\nsystems and information to which he had been entrusted. His conduct violated that\nagreement. As to AG \u00b6 16(c), as discussed under Guideline M, above, the information\nwas not sufficient for an adverse determination; however, this disqualifying condition\ndoes not apply because of a favorable whole-person analysis, below. Finally, although\nApplicant misused government resources by deleting a co-worker\u2019s account, his\nconduct is specifically addressed under Guideline M. Accordingly, AG \u00b6 16(d) does not\napply. The remaining disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 16 are inapposite to the facts\nand circumstances of this case.\nAvailable information further requires application of the mitigating condition at AG\n\u00b6 17(c) (the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is so\ninfrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is unlikely to recur\nand does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment). For the same reasons discussed under the Guideline M mitigating condition\nat AG  \u00b6 41(a), application of AG \u00b6 17(c) is sufficient to mitigate the security concerns\nabout Applicant\u2019s personal conduct. \n\n8\nWhole-Person Concept\nI have evaluated the facts presented and have applied the appropriate\nadjudicative factors under Guidelines E and M. I have also reviewed the record before\nme in the context of the whole-person factors listed in AG \u00b6 2(a). Applicant is 46 years\nold, married for 25 years, and the father of three. He is also a distinguished veteran of\nthe U.S. Army, who served for 23 years before retiring in 2005. He has held a security\nclearance through the military and as a civilian for almost 30 years. His reputation for\nhonesty, hard work, integrity, and reliability is significant. He has acknowledged his\nwrongdoing in this matter, and he has paid a high professional and personal price for\nhis actions. His resignation in February 2008 resulted in several months of under-\nemployment before he was hired for his current job later that year. Evaluations of his\nmilitary and civilian job performance have been excellent. All of the information bearing\non Applicant\u2019s character, judgment, honesty, and reliability indicates that Applicant\u2019s\ncontinued access to classified information does not present an unacceptable risk to the\nGovernment despite the adverse information in his background. A fair and\ncommonsense evaluation of this record shows that the security concerns raised by\nApplicant\u2019s conduct relative to information technology systems and personal conduct\nare mitigated. Any doubts about Applicant\u2019s suitability for access to classified\ninformation have been satisfied.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by section\nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline M:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline E:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the foregoing, it is clearly consistent with the national interest to\ngrant Applicant\u2019s request for access to classified information. Request for security\nclearance is granted.\n                            \n                                                    \nMATTHEW E. MALONE\nAdministrative Judge\n",

The action\nwas taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within\nIndustry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6,\nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992),\nas amended (Directive); and the Adjudicative Guidelines (AG). \nIn a response to the SOR notarized on October 9, 2009, Applicant admitted six\nof the 20 Guideline F allegations and admitted the facts underlying the three allegations\nset forth under Guideline E. Applicant also requested a hearing. DOHA assigned the\ncase to me on December 1, 2009. The parties agreed to a hearing date of January 20,\n2010,  and a notice to that effect was issued on December 16, 2009. That hearing was\npostponed because Applicant was out of the country at the time. It was rescheduled for\nFebruary 10, 2010, but that hearing was postponed and rescheduled for February 22,\nSeptember 24, 2010\n\n Tr. 11.\n      1\n Id.\n      2\n Tr. 12. This representation was later confirmed.\n      3\n Ex. 22 (Letter, dated Jun. 7, 2010)\n      4\n2\n2010, due to inclement weather.  The hearing was convened as rescheduled and\n1\nApplicant waived his right to a 15-day notice for the hearing.  \n2\nDepartment Counsel introduced 17 documents, which were accepted into the\nrecord without objection as exhibits (Exs.) 1-17. He noted that the debts referenced in\nSOR allegations \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.d, 1.p, and 1,q had been either settled or satisfied, and that\nthe debts noted in \u00b6 1.f and \u00b6 1.j are duplicative.  Applicant gave testimony, introduced\n3\none character witness, and offered six documents, admitted into the record without\nobjection as Ex. A-F. Eleven documents were also offered by Applicant and admitted as\nhearing exhibits (HE) A-K. \nApplicant was given until March 10, 2010, to supplement the record with any\nadditional documents. The transcript (Tr.) of the proceeding was received on March 2,\n2010. On March 24, 2010, Department Counsel forwarded 10 additional documents\nreceived from Applicant between March 4, 2010, and March 11, 2010. They were\nadmitted collectively without objection as Ex. G (1-10). The record was then closed. On\nApril 16, 2010, Applicant directly emailed to me and Department Counsel materials\nupdating his debt status. On April 20, 2010, Department Counsel objected to the\nsubmission as untimely. In order to preserve a complete record of Applicant\u2019s debt\nstatus, the record was reopened and the document was accepted as Ex. H. The record\nwas then closed. \nOn May 10, 2010, Applicant again directly submitted a document. Against\nDepartment Counsel\u2019s objection, I admitted the document as Ex. I with the request\nApplicant expeditiously submit a demonstrative exhibit reflecting the updates to the\nrecord. On May 28, 2010, Applicant submitted the requested demonstrative exhibit,\nincluding copies of previously admitted documents in an effort to provide a more\ncomplete representation of Applicant\u2019s current debt status. On June 10, 2010, I\nreceived a June 7, 2010, objection to Applicant\u2019s submission from Department Counsel\nurging that the submission was untimely.  Inasmuch as the latest submission was\n4\nhelpful in incorporating the various post-hearing submissions into the record, it was\naccepted as Ex. J. Upon admission, the record was closed on June 10, 2010. Based on\na thorough review of the testimony, submissions, and exhibits, I find Applicant failed to\nmeet his burden regarding the security concerns raised. Security clearance denied.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 49-year-old program manager for a defense contractor. He has\nworked for that employer for the past decade. Applicant has earned a high school\ndiploma, an associate\u2019s degree In aeronautics, and a specialized professional license.\n\n Tr. 112.\n      5\n Tr. 28.\n      6\n Tr. 112.\n      7\n Tr. 113.\n      8\n Tr. 53.\n      9\n Tr. 113-114.\n      10\n Tr. 108, referencing Applicant\u2019s reduced income and temporary elimination of his wife\u2019s income during\n      11\nhis convalescence. \n Tr. 33.\n      12\n3\nHe served in the United States (U.S.) military for nine years. Applicant is married and\nhas four children. Because he works abroad almost 80% of the time, maintaining\ncontact with his family is difficult.\nBefore 2004, Applicant had no serious financial difficulties. In 2004, he\npurchased a new home. Shortly thereafter, he was injured and underwent extensive\nback surgery in late 2004.  During nearly five months of recuperation, he exhausted his\n5\nvacation time. He then relied on short term, then long term disability.  His disability\n6\npayments paid him at approximately 60% of his usual salary, based on an annual\nincome of about $90,000. His wife, a registered nurse, took an unpaid leave of absence\nfrom her $50,000 a year job to care for Applicant during the first few months of his\nrecovery. During this period, their household income dropped from about $140,000 to\napproximately $54,000.  When Applicant returned to work in February 2005, he\n7\nresumed his $90,000 per year position.  After about 12 to 18 months, he resumed his\n8\nextensive travel schedule. He currently earns approximately $130,000 a year.  When\n9\nApplicant\u2019s wife returned to work in 2005, she returned on a part-time basis, earning\nabout $30,000 or $35,000 per year until 2009, when she only earned about $1,000.10\nDuring his recuperation and transition back to full-time employment, Applicant\nhad serious difficulty paying his family\u2019s expenses. Five months with a considerable cut\nin income produced a financial \u201cdomino effect\u201d on his finances.  His household income\n11\nwas also substantially reduced by his wife\u2019s return to work on a part-time basis. He\nrelied on his savings to supplement his income. Then, in middle or late 2005, he joined\na credit counseling service. The service provided little help. Some creditors would not\nwork with the service, and service fees were high. After about three months, he\nabandoned the credit counseling service. He then consulted attorneys who advised him\nto declare bankruptcy, but he chose to honor his creditors directly.  Ultimately, in 2006,\n12\nhe began working with his creditors directly. He first started paying off tax liens, then\nstarted working with those creditors that were willing to work with him immediately. He\nthen moved on to other creditors in an effort to work out repayment plans. He is now\nworking with his employer to satisfy his debts. He hopes to have all of his debts paid off\n\n Tr. 34. \n      13\n Tr. 115-116.\n      14\n Ex. G (1) (Counsel\u2019s email, dated Mar. 10, 2010) and Ex G (2) (Declaration, dated Mar. 8, 2010).\n      15\n Ex. G (2), supra, note 15.\n      16\n Id.\n      17\n Id.\n      18\n Id.\n      19\n Id.\n      20\n Id.\n      21\n Id.; see also Tr. 12\u2013124.\n      22\n4\nin 18 to 24 months.  Devoted to his work, Applicant is willing to continue working\n13\noverseas at higher wages 75% to 80% of the time in order to expedite the resolution of\nfinancial difficulties.   \n14\nAfter the hearing, some of the debts at issue in the SOR were paid or settled by\nApplicant\u2019s employer, which has \u201cagreed to immediately repay all of [Applicant\u2019s] past\ndue debts.\u201d   In his March 8, 2010, post-hearing declaration, the founder and Chief\n15\nOperating Executive (CEO) of Applicant\u2019s company, demonstrated his full trust and faith\nin Applicant. Apprised of Applicant\u2019s financial distress after the hearing, he surmises\nthat Applicant is capable of resolving his own financial difficulties. \u201d  The CEO operates\n16\nhis business like a family. He noted that had he been aware of Applicant\u2019s financial\nwoes, the company would have assisted Applicant earlier to help him address his debt.\nHe has arranged to have the entity\u2019s finance manager \u201csettle each of [Applicant\u2019s]\ndebts\u201d directly with each creditor.  Applicant will then be subject to a no-interest loan\n17\n\u201cadvance against such future bonuses and pay raises, along with biweekly payroll\ndeductions.\u201d  \n18\nAt the time of the March 2010 declaration, the company believed that the\ndelinquent debt subject to this arrangement would be approximately $27,000 or\n$49,800 if a debt to the Internal Revenue Service \u201cis rolled in.\u201d  The March 2010\n19\ndeclaration states that coordination of payments on Applicant\u2019s debts would be made\nwithin three weeks or as quickly as possible depending on cooperation by Applicant\u2019s\ncreditors.  A no-interest loan advance repayment would then commence. Under that\n20\nplan, \u201c[p]ayroll deductions will be remitted each month over the next 24 months, and up\nto 75 percent of any bonuses (Annual Appraisal, Team Award, and/or Individual\nIncentive Award) accumulated during the next two (2) years\u201d will similarly be applied to\nthe loan balance through automatic payroll deduction.  The employer has offered such\n21\naid to others in the past. The CEO believes Applicant is loyal, committed, and deserving\nof this aid.  \n22\n\n Based on the evidence submitted on May 28, 2010, and discussed below, it appears that approximately\n      23\n$18,300 has thus far directly been paid by Applicant\u2019s employer to pay or settle his debts. As noted, there is\nno indication whether it has or will absorb into the advance loan those debts paid or settled by Applicant by\ntelephonic payment, check, or money order. Similarly, there is no evidence whether the IRS debt referenced\nin the declaration, but not at issue in the SOR, has been paid by either Applicant or his employer.  \n Ex. G (2), supra, note 15.\n      24\n As noted above. See also Tr. 12. The Government also indicated that the debt at SOR allegation \u00b6 1.u\n      25\nwas settled or satisfied, but there is no allegation \u00b6 1.u.\n5\nBefore the record closed in June 2010, no final agreement reflecting a total sum\ncertain or specifically enumerating which of Applicant\u2019s debts the entity has paid or is\nwilling to pay on Applicant\u2019s behalf was submitted.  Similarly, no submission was\n23\noffered noting whether any of the debts at issue are excluded from this agreement. No\nevidence was presented reflecting what actual or projected net monthly income\nApplicant would receive after deductions toward this loan are taken, nor was a family\nbudget introduced showing how Applicant would live on his revised income after payroll\ndeductions for the loan. The payments thus far paid by the business on Applicant\u2019s\nbehalf are noted below as having been paid by a business check. The company is an\nestablished entity. Its mailed checks are presumed to be valid evidence of payment to\nthe payee. There is no indication whether payments made directly by Applicant before\nMarch 8, 2010, are subject to reimbursement by the company for incorporation into the\nloan, or whether Applicant\u2019s post-March 8, 2010, payments might be reimbursed for\nincorporation into the loan. The employer\u2019s declaration provides that Applicant will work\nwith a financial management consultant for \u201cadvice and assistance.\u201d24\nThe debts referenced in SOR allegations \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.d, 1.p, and 1,q have been\neither settled or satisfied, and the debts noted in \u00b6 1.f and \u00b6 1.j are duplicate entries\nreflecting the same debt noted as \u00b6 1.a.  Substantial evidence was offered establishing\n25\nthese facts. The debts remaining at issue in the SOR are \u00b6\u00b6:\n1.b \u2013 August 2008 Judgment for $763. Settled. Applicant settled the judgment balance\nof $1,015.32 for $812.26 on or about April 8, 2010. A business check for that amount\nwas mailed to the collection entity on April 10, 2010. No receipt of payment was\npresented. Lacking objection by the Government, official postal service mailing of that\ncheck, as represented, provides adequate evidence that this debt is resolved. See Ex.\nJ, Tab B.\n1.c \u2013 June 2007 Judgment for $12,615. Settled. Applicant negotiated a settlement for\nthis debt, now with a balance of $16,050.18, by which payment of $11,500 before April\n30, 2010, would satisfy this debt. He provided evidence that a business check was\nmailed for $11,500 on April 13, 2010, providing adequate evidence that this debt has\nbeen resolved. Barring objection by the Government, I find this debt is addressed. See\nEx. J, Tab C.\n1.e \u2013 October 2007 Judgment for $563. Paid. This judgment was filed in county court in\nOctober 2007. Applicant provided a copy of a law firm\u2019s letter referencing A/C No 14231\n\n Ex. J, Tab G (Correspondence). See also Ex. G (7) (Email, dated Sep. 14, 2009), noting that as of\n      26\nSeptember 2009, Applicant was \u201cactively repaying on a repay plan.\u201d\n See also Tr. 134.\n      27\n Ex. K (Letter, dated Jun. 7, 2010).\n      28\n Ex. J, Tab N (Income Execution and related paperwork).\n      29\n6\nand the name of the same creditor as noted in the judgment which was written in\nOctober 2006, before the judgment was entered. He also provided a copy of a recent\nbusiness check in the amount of $794.52 to that law firm and proof of mailing. The\ncheck does not indicate the name of the underlying creditor or an account number, but\nthe payment effort is linked to the debt by its being made payable to the law firm shown\nas representing the creditor. There is no evidence Applicant\u2019s employer was willing to\npay for any debts not at issue. Therefore, in light of this evidence, there is adequate\nevidence this debt is paid. See Ex. J, Tab E.\n1.g \u2013 Mortgage Past Due approximately $11,000. Status unclear. Applicant provided\nevidence that in August and September 2009, he was working with this creditor\nregarding a repayment plan.  His efforts were sufficient to divert steps toward\n26\nforeclosure. Under the plan referenced, payment on the debt was to have continued\nthrough May 2010. Applicant provided no evidence that payments on this plan have\nbeen made or that the balance has been reduced since the 2009 exchange of\ncorrespondence. See Ex. J, Tab G. Applicant did, however, submit a pre-printed\nmortgage stub designated \u201cPaymt. No. 4,\" with an \u201cON [illegible] PAYMENT DUE\u201d of\n$2,655.58 due on \u201cAPR. 1, 2010,\u201d and a \u201cLATE PAYMENT\u201d balance due date for\npayment after \u201cAPR. 16, 2010\" of $2,726.30.  See Ex. G (6). No evidence of an April\n2010 payment, any post-September 2009 payments, or an updated balance was\noffered to show this debt\u2019s current status and balance.27\n1.h \u2013 Debt for $73 and 1.i for $119. Insufficient evidence. Applicant provided evidence\nthat his electronic payment for $80 was processed by this creditor on April 13, 2010.\nSee Ex. J, Tab H. He represented that the payment was for the $73 debt. The account\nnumber for the account balance paid does not correspond with the account numbers\nshown on the credit reports for these accounts, although notice is taken that medical\naccount numbers on credit reports do not always reflect the underlying entity\u2019s actual\naccount number.\n1.k \u2013 1.m \u2013 Debts for approximately $11,129. Settled. These three accounts were\nsettled by payment of $4,100, remitted on a business check and mailed on April 12,\n2010. Department Counsel stressed that \u201cit is critical to note that these debts were\nsettled for a fraction of the total amount owed.\u201d  See Ex. J, Tab K.\n28\n1.n \u2013 Charged-off Account for approximately $6,060. Insufficient evidence. A judgment\nin the amount of $9,282.97 was ultimately entered against Applicant in 2006 for this\ndebt.  The creditor is named in the county\u2019s judgment order. It is the same creditor\n29\n\n See Exs. 5-13 (credit reports from Nov. 5, 2009, Aug. 5, 2009, and Nov. 4, 2009, six filings of judgments\n      30\nand liens, and county court record). Applicant testified that he has had only one account with this creditor. Tr.\n91. Ex. 5 (Credit report, dated Nov. 4, 2008), however, reflects two account entries with this creditor. Although\nthey share the same date of account opening, they reflect different dates of last activity and account numbers.\n Tr. 143-144. Compare Tr. 132-134, 137.\n      31\n Tr. 130.\n      32\n Tr. 98. \n      33\n7\nnoted in the SOR for this debt. Payment is shown on this judgment in the amount of\n$8,388.77, in July 2008 to the county sheriff. There is no evidence that a second,\nseparate judgment by this creditor was obtained by this creditor against Applicant.30\nHowever, there is no link showing the $8,388.77 payment was made toward or satisfied\nthis $9,282.97 judgment. See Ex. J, Tab N. No documentation shows why there is a\ndiscrepancy in the amount of payment.\n1.o \u2013 Charged-off Account for approximately $7,095. Settled. This account was settled\nfor an undisclosed amount in 2005. See Ex. J, Tab O.\n1.r \u2013 Collection Account for approximately $74. Paid. Applicant showed evidence of a\nUnited States Postal Service money order in the amount of $74.50 payable to this\ncreditor. See Ex. J, Tab R.\n1.s \u2013 Collection Account for approximately $541. Insufficient evidence. Applicant\nprovided evidence of a settlement offer to resolve this matter on payment of $162.95.\nThe offer has \u201c$320.06. Check by phone. 4/7/2010\" handwritten on it, but there is no\nevidence of payment, receipt, or transaction, such as a bank statement or on-line\nstatement indicating the payment was successfully made.  See Ex. J, Tab S.\n1.t \u2013 Collection Account for approximately $1,114. Settled. Applicant provided evidence\nof a February 2010 offer to settle this balance for a 70% savings by payment of $334.44\nin the form of a business check mailed on April 10, 2010. See Ex. J, Tab T. \nApplicant, in citing to relevant Appeal Board case law, argued that \u201cthe question\nis not that the Applicant has paid off all of the indebtedness before the security\nclearance arises, only they they\u2019ve established a reasonable plan to resolve the debts,\nand that they\u2019ve taken significant actions to implement the plan.\u201d  Department Counsel\n31\nurges, among other arguments, particular consideration of not just the establishment of\na reasonable plan, but the timing of payments in respect to an applicant\u2019s payment\nhistory.  \n32\nIn addition to Applicant\u2019s finances, his execution of a security clearance\napplication on or about September 5, 2008 is at issue. Before completing that\napplication, he did not check his credit report.  At the time, he knew only that he had\n33\n\n Tr. 98-99, .\n      34\n Tr. 99-100, 115-116.\n      35\n Regarding the judgments, Applicant was apparently unaware that some of what he thought were debts\n      36\nwere, in fact, judgments. See, e.g., Tr. 100. Applicant never appeared in court for any of the proceedings\nleading to his adverse judgments. Tr. 104. He was often overseas and usually only received collection calls\nor information regarding those calls. Id.\n Ex. 1 (Security clearance application, dated Sep. 5, 2008) at 28-29 of 31.\n      37\n Tr. 97-98.\n      38\n Tr. 100.\n      39\n8\n\u201csome debts.\u201d  He was in a rush to complete the application, basing his answers on a\n34\nprevious application.  On that application, in response to Section 27c, he denied\n35\nhaving any property liens for taxes or debts, despite the ultimately resolved obligation\nnoted in SOR allegation \u00b6 1.d. In response to Section 27d, he denied having had any\nadverse judgments in the preceding seven years that had yet to be paid, although\nunpaid judgments were then existent.  In response to Section 28, he admitted being\n36\n\u201ccurrently over 90 days delinquent on any debt[s])\u201d and denied being \u201cover 180 days\ndelinquent on any debt[s]).\u201d  When instructed to supply account information if he\n37\nanswered \u201cyes\u201d to either question regarding delinquent debts, he noted only the debt\nlisted in the SOR as \u00b6 1.j. He did not consider any debts upon which he had made\npayments or was working with the creditor as delinquent.  Applicant described his\n38\nomissions as a \u201cmistake.\u201d39\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, an\nadministrative judge must consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations\nfor each guideline, the AG list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating\nconditions. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. Under AG \u00b6 2(c), this\nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole\nperson concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable\ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a\ndecision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based\non the evidence contained in the record.\n\n See also ISCR Case No. 94-1075 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Aug. 10, 1995).\n      40\n Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988).\n      41\n ISCR Case No. 93-1390 at 7-8 (App. Bd. Jan. 27, 1995).\n      42\n Id.\n      43\n Id.\n      44\n9\nThe government must present evidence to establish controverted facts alleged in\nthe SOR. An applicant is responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to\nrebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by\nDepartment Counsel. . . .\u201d  The burden of proof is something less than a\n40\npreponderance of evidence.  The ultimate burden of persuasion is on the applicant.  \n41\n42\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\ngovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration\nof the possible risk an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \u201cThe clearly consistent standard\nindicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of\ndenials.\u201d  Any reasonable doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access\n43\nto sensitive information must be resolved in favor of protecting such sensitive\ninformation.44\nBased \nupon \nconsideration \nof \nthe \nevidence, \nGuideline \nF \n(Financial\nConsiderations) is the most pertinent to this case. Conditions pertaining to this\nadjudicative guideline that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying, as\nwell as those which would mitigate such concerns, are set forth and discussed below.\nAnalysis\nUnder Guideline F, \u201cfailure or an inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy\ndebts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nan unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified\n\n AG \u00b6 18, which also notes, \u201cAn individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage\n      45\nin illegal acts to generate funds.\u201d\n Regarding the debts cited at SOR allegations \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.c, 1.e, and 1.k.\n      46\n10\ninformation.\u201d  The guideline sets out several potentially disqualifying conditions. Here,\n45\nApplicant admitted several of the numerous delinquent debts enumerated in the SOR,\nentries derived from his credit reports. Many date back to late 2004 through 2006, an\nacknowledged period of financial difficulty. Financial Considerations Disqualifying\nCondition (FC DC) AG \u00b6 19(a) (inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts) and FC DC\nAG \u00b6 9(c) (a history of not meeting financial obligations) apply. With such conditions\nraised, the burden shifts to Applicant to overcome the case against him and mitigate\nsecurity concerns. \nThe SOR lists 20 delinquent debts (\u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.t) amounting to nearly $74,000. In\nhis response to the SOR, Applicant admitted to six of the 20 SOR allegations,\nrepresenting approximately $14,560 in delinquent debt, and, with explanations, denied\nthe remaining debts alleged. At the hearing, Applicant attributed his acquisition of\ndelinquent debt mainly to a period between late 2004 and 2006, when he was seriously\ninjured, underwent surgery, and had a protracted convalescence. For about five\nmonths, he generated a significantly reduced income and his wife took unpaid leave to\naid him. During that time, their household income was reduced from about $140,000 to\napproximately $54,000. Since that time, Applicant\u2019s health has improved, he has\nreturned to work, and he now spends approximately about 75% of his work effort\nabroad in order to earn a higher income to help him address his financial situation. In\n2006, he utilized a credit counseling service to address his debts, but the venture was\nunproductive. Lawyers advised him to declare bankruptcy, an option he declined to\npursue. He then decided to address his debts on his own, one at a time. At the\nFebruary 2010 hearing, Applicant\u2019s employer surmised the extent of Applicant\u2019s debt\nand chose to intercede, continuing an apparent corporate tradition of treating the entity\nas a family. The CEO graciously offered to pay or settle Applicant\u2019s remaining debts\nand pursue recoupment for the sum expended on Applicant\u2019s behalf through a payroll\ndeduction repayment plan. In March 2010, the employer outlined the terms of this\narrangement. The most recent evidence shows that the employer has thus far obligated\nover $17,000  on an overall assessment of Applicant\u2019s debt that ranges from $27,000\n46\nto $49,800, depending on whether a federal tax debt not at issue in the SOR is\nincorporated.\nApplicant presented evidence that most of the numerous debts at issue have\nbeen settled or paid. Conversely, several debts remain unsatisfied or lack clear\nevidence of either their satisfaction or their current status. This includes the delinquent\ndebts cited in SOR allegations \u00b6\u00b6 1.g, 1.h, 1.i, 1.n, and 1.s, involving a total sum in\nexcess of $18,000. Moreover, Applicant offered his employer\u2019s assurance that it would\nlend Applicant the necessary sums to satisfy his debts. While the employer\u2019s\nexpression of confidence in Applicant is clear and the CEO\u2019s benevolence is striking,\nthe gesture arrives late in the process. In addition, the payment/repayment plan\u2019s\nrelatively specific terms fail to identify exactly which delinquent debts of those at issue\n\n11\nhere are, have been, or will be satisfied directly by the business. Furthermore, lacking a\nspecific total sum of the debt transferred from delinquent creditors to employer,\nassessment cannot be made with regard to whether the loan can be repaid in the time\nallotted; whether the undefined payroll deductions will leave Applicant with sufficient\nfunds to maintain his current lifestyle, obligations, and needs; or whether Applicant will\ncontinue to derive an income sufficient to honor his repayment obligations if a security\nclearance is not maintained. Given these considerations, and the fact the record lacks\nevidence that all of the debts at issue have been adequately addressed, FC MC AG \u00b6\n20(a) (the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such\ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s\ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment) does not apply. \nClearly, Applicant\u2019s medical issues and related surgery were unforeseen. A\nrelated and unexpected, drastic drop in household income from about $140,000 a year\nto approximately $54,000 a year for a five-month period is highly significant. After his\nrecuperation, Applicant pursued credit counseling, legal help, and self-budgeting to\naddress his debts, albeit with varying rates of success. Such facts give rise to FC MC\nAG \u00b6 20(b) (the conditions that resulted in the behavior were largely beyond the\nperson\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical\nemergency, or a death, divorce or separation) and the individual acted responsibly\nunder the circumstances).\nAs part of Applicant\u2019s employer\u2019s loan advance and repayment plan, Applicant\nwas required to meet with a financial management consultant for advice and\nassistance. While there is no evidence as to the extent of this consultation or whether it\nhas transpired, the facts indicate that the employer is resolute in its offer overall.\nAssuming Applicant met with this consultant and received or is receiving a program\ntantamount to financial counseling, and in light of evidence that many of the debts at\nissue have been paid, settled, or are being resolved, FC MC \u00b6 20(c) (the person has\nreceived or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear indications\nthat the problem is being resolved or is under control) applies to those delinquent\nobligations. In addition, given the number of debts thus far addressed and adequately\ndocumented, FC MC \u00b6 20(d) (the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue\ncreditors or otherwise resolve debts) applies.\nIt is plain that the \u201cdomino effect\u201d of Applicant\u2019s injury, surgery, and recuperation,\nwhich featured a five-month long, approximately 61% reduction in household income,\nadversely affected Applicant\u2019s financial situation. Whether nearly $74,000 in alleged\ndelinquent debt and probable interest and fees can be attributed from that five-month\ndrop from $140,000 to $54,000 annual household income, however, is questionable.\nRegardless, Applicant explored resolution of his dilemma with credit counseling and\nlawyers before attempting to tackle the problem on his own. Since that time, undeniable\nprogress has been made by Applicant in addressing many of the 20 debts at issue in\nthe SOR. \nWhile progress has been made, at least $17,000 of that debt has not so much\nbeen resolved as it has been temporarily displaced, to the extent that it was paid by\nApplicant\u2019s employer with anticipation of repayment in the next two years. In addition,\n\n In substance, there are two repayment plans. One is the plan executed on Applicant\u2019s behalf by his\n      47\nemployer. The second is the plan for Applicant\u2019s repayment of the loan created by his employer\u2019s\nexpenditures. \n AG \u00b6 15.\n      48\n Id.\n      49\n12\nevidence regarding the current status of the nearly $18,000 at issue for SOR allegations\n\u00b6\u00b6 1.g, 1.h, 1.i, 1.n, and 1.s has yet to be validated.  The amount to be repaid to\nApplicant\u2019s employer, and any balances yet owed on any other accounts, are to be paid\nin the future from Applicant\u2019s net monthly salary. Applicant currently earns about\n$130,000 and his wife recently earned only $1,000 in income, less than the\napproximately $140,000 in household income Applicant had when he first encountered\nfinancial difficulty. Without more evidence and information showing what debts are\nbeing paid by the employer, how much new debt Applicant will be obligated to repay his\nemployer, and what Applicant\u2019s net available income will be following loan-related\ndeductions, it is impossible to discern whether Applicant can  suffer and sustain a 24-\nmonth long reduction in household income that would lead him into more delinquent\ndebt. This is particularly worrisome given the substantial debt acquired over a five-\nmonth period in 2005, and his past inability to satisfy those same debts over the past\nfew years. \nApplicant, in citing to relevant Appeal Board case law, argued that the question is\nnot that the Applicant has paid off all of the indebtedness before the security clearance\narises, only that they have established a reasonable plan to resolve the debts, and that\nthey have taken significant actions to implement the plan. This is true. However,\nwhether a plan is reasonable can only be assessed when sufficient information is\nestablished with regard to the terms and Applicant\u2019s ability to adhere to that plan.\nWithout more information detailing all the obligations subsumed into the loan, the full\namount of the obligation to be repaid over 24 months, verification that other debts at\nissue in the SOR and not subject to that loan are resolved, and a more thorough\ndepiction of Applicant\u2019s current, post-loan budgetary needs, it is impossible to assess\nwhether the present debt repayment plans are workable and potentially effective.47\nAbsent such additional evidence, financial considerations security concerns remain\nunmitigated.    \nGuideline E \u2013 Personal Conduct\nSecurity concerns arise from matters of personal conduct because \u201cconduct\ninvolving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply\nwith rules and regulations can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability,\ntrustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information.\u201c  In addition, \u201cany failure to\n48\nprovide truthful and candid answers during the security clearance process or any other\nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process\u201d is of special interest.  Here,\n49\npersonal conduct concerns were potentially raised when Applicant failed to identify his\ndelinquent debts and judgments on his security clearance application. If such a failure\nwas deliberate, such omissions would be sufficient to raise Personal Conduct\n\n13\nDisqualifying Condition AG \u00b6 16(a) (deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of\nrelevant facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or\nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications,\naward benefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or\naward fiduciary responsibilities). Consequently, the burden shifts to Applicant to\nmitigate the resultant security concerns.\nApplicant credibly testified that he did not intentionally mislead or falsify when he\nonly noted one delinquency on his security clearance application. His explanation was\ncredible, especially since he was in a rush, based his answers on a previously\nsubmitted application, and had not checked his credit report. Absent evidence that his\nomissions were intentional or fraudulent, the disqualifying condition cited must fail.\nHowever, if a disqualifying condition did apply, Personal Conduct Mitigating Condition\nAG \u00b6 17(e) (the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability to\nexploitation, manipulation, or duress) would apply. Absent evidence of intentional falsity\nor omission, personal conduct security concerns are mitigated.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of an applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a). Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate\ndetermination of whether to grant a security clearance must be an overall\ncommonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines and the\nwhole person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case, as well as the \u201cwhole person\u201d\nfactors. Applicant is a mature, educated, and credible witness who served this country\nthrough nine years of military service. He is a devoted husband and father. Applicant is\nemployed by an understanding and generous employer. There, he is a highly regarded\nemployee who works tirelessly, usually at a great distance from his family. Applicant\nincurred an injury that demanded major surgery in 2004. His wife, a nurse, took leave\nwithout pay to care for him during his recovery. He incurred significant debt during the\nfive months he recuperated, during which he depleted his savings and lived on\ncompensation that provided only 60% of his salary. After that five month period, he\nreturned to work at full salary, while his wife returned to work part-time. \nIn 2005, Applicant sought to address his acquired debt through a credit\ncounseling program, but the program was ineffective. He consulted attorneys who\nadvised him to file for bankruptcy, but Applicant wanted to honor his debts directly. He\nthen proceeded to address his debts on his own, apparently without the aid of formal\nfinancial advice. Many debts were addressed, although a substantial amount of his debt\nwas settled for less than he originally owed. \nWhen Applicant appeared at the March 2010 hearing, he provided evidence of\nan unorchestrated and protracted, but somewhat effective approach to his debts. After\n\n Applicant\u2019s employer\u2019s plan is exceptionally lenient with regard to the loan\u2019s framework of terms. W hether\n      50\nis is reasonable, however, cannot be discerned without actual numbers, enumerated accounts, and specific\ndollar sums regarding deductions to be applied toward repayment of the loan.\n14\nthe hearing, he entered into an agreement with his employer. Under that agreement, his\ncompany would pay Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts. In return, Applicant is to repay any\ndebt incurred by his employer on his behalf. Evidence of the loan and its repayment\nplan is lacking specificity. While the plan proposed reflects that the loan is interest-free,\nshould be repaid within two years, and designates from what sources Applicant\u2019s\npayments should be derived, it does not enumerate what debts at issue will be paid or\nreimbursed by the business. The anticipated sum of the loan is projected only as being\nbetween approximately $27,000 and 49,800, which poses an exceptionally broad\nrange. Without a fixed or more finite loan amount defined, the ability of Applicant to\nbudget his net income, as reduced through payroll deductions to pay on that loan, is\nincalculable. It further confounds attempts to judge the plan as reasonable when\ninsufficient terms and sums are offered to assess whether Applicant can adjust to the\nresultant reduction in net income and still effectively manage his other current\nobligations. This is an essential consideration given the tremendous debt Applicant\npreviously incurred over only five months on a reduced income. Because of that\nexperience, such information is important in order to gauge his current ability to live\nwithin his means while honoring this repayment through payroll deduction. In addition to\nthe above, questions remain as to whether purported payments on other debts were\nsuccessfully transacted and credited. \nThere is no issue here regarding Applicant\u2019s honesty, loyalty, or industriousness.\nHe has proven himself as a dedicated citizen and a highly valued employee. The\nburden in these proceedings, however, is placed squarely on the Applicant. The\nevidence provided is  deficient, both in terms of past payments and his financial ability\nto adhere to the still-undefined plan proposed by his employer.  The protection of the\n50\nnational security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) requires that any doubt\nconcerning personnel being considered for access to classified information will be\nresolved in favor of national security. The \u201cclearly consistent standard\u201d indicates that\nsecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials. Any\nreasonable doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access to sensitive\ninformation must be resolved in favor of protecting such sensitive information. In light of\nthese standards and the evidence submitted, I conclude Applicant failed to meet his\nburden and mitigate financial considerations security concerns. Clearance is denied.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as\nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a \u2013 1.f \nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g \u2013 1.i \nAgainst Applicant\n\n15\nSubparagraph 1.j  \u2013 1.m\n \nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.n\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.o \u2013 1.r \nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.s\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.t \n \nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline E:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a \u2013 1.c \nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national interest to grant Applicant a security clearance.\nClearance denied.\nARTHUR E.

After a thorough review of the pleadings, Applicant\u2019s response to the Statement of Reasons, and the FORM submitted by the government, I make the following additional findings of fact. Applicant is 60 years old. He served in the U.S. Army from 1970 until his honorable discharge in December 1971. Applicant has never been married and has no children. He attended trade school from approximately 1972 to 1974 and received a certificate in electronics technology. Since 1974, he has worked for the same defense contractor, where his current position is electronics technician (Items 4, 5). Applicant started smoking marijuana in 1970, at approximately 21 years old, when he was in the U.S. Army. He smoked marijuana throughout the 1970s, sometimes daily, and also purchased it. His purchases amounted to approximately $5,500 between 1970 and 1981. Applicant continued to use marijuana, although less frequently after he started using cocaine. He did not use marijuana from December 1986 to July 1990 (Item 8). In 1979, when he was about 30 years old, Applicant tried cocaine. By 1983, he was using it about once per month, and in 1986, he began to use it on a daily basis.

After reviewing the results of the ensuing background \ninvestigation, adjudicators for the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) \nwere unable to make a preliminary affirmative finding1 that it is clearly consistent with \nthe national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s request.  \n \n                                                 \n1 Required by Executive Order 10865, as amended, and DoD Directive 5220.6 (Directive), as amended. \nDecember 10, 2009\n\n \n \n2\n                                                \nOn August 17, 2009, DOHA issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) \nthat specified the basis for its decision \u2013 security concerns addressed in the Directive \nunder Guidelines H (Drug Involvement) and E (Personal Conduct) of the Revised \nAdjudicative Guidelines (AG).2 \n \nApplicant signed his notarized Answer on September 10, 2008, in which he \nadmitted all allegations under Guideline H3 and Guideline E. In his Answer, Applicant \nalso requested a decision without a hearing. DOHA Department Counsel submitted a \nfile of relevant materials (FORM), dated September 24, 2009, which included nine \ndocuments (Items 1-9) proffered in support of the government\u2019s case. Applicant \nreceived the FORM on October 6, 2009, and was given 30 days to file a response. He \ndid not submit a response to the FORM. The case was assigned to me on December 7, \n2009. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions in response to the SOR are admitted as fact. After a \nthorough review of the pleadings, Applicant\u2019s response to the Statement of Reasons, \nand  the FORM submitted by the government, I make the following additional findings of \nfact. \n \nApplicant is 60 years old. He served in the U.S. Army from 1970 until his \nhonorable discharge in December 1971. Applicant has never been married and has no \nchildren. He attended trade school from approximately 1972 to 1974 and received a \ncertificate in electronics technology. Since 1974, he has worked for the same defense \ncontractor, where his current position is electronics technician (Items 4, 5). \n \nApplicant started smoking marijuana in 1970, at approximately 21 years old, \nwhen he was in the U.S. Army. He smoked marijuana throughout the 1970s, \nsometimes daily, and also purchased it. His purchases amounted to approximately \n$5,500 between 1970 and 1981. Applicant continued to use marijuana, although less \nfrequently after he started using cocaine. He did not use marijuana from December \n1986 to July 1990 (Item 8).  \n \n \nIn 1979, when he was about 30 years old, Applicant tried cocaine. By 1983, he \nwas using it about once per month, and in 1986, he began to use it on a daily basis. At \n \n2 Adjudication of this case is controlled by the Revised Adjudicative Guidelines, approved by the \nPresident on December 29, 2005, which were implemented by the Department of Defense on \nSeptember 1, 2006. The Revised Adjudicative Guidelines supersede the guidelines listed in Enclosure 2 \nto the Directive, and they apply to all adjudications or trustworthiness determinations in which an SOR \nwas issued on or after September 1, 2006. \n \n3 Applicant clarified in his Answer that in 1989 his security clearance was denied, not revoked, as \nalleged in subparagraph 1.e. \n\n \n \n3\nthat point, he was spending about $3,000 per year on cocaine, and buying from local \ndealers. His use began to affect his work performance, and he entered his employer\u2019s \nEmployee Assistance Program (EAP) in 1987. He completed a 28-day inpatient \nprogram that year. Shortly after his release, he began using cocaine again, while he \nwas in a six-month aftercare program (Item 8). \n \n \nIn May 1987, Applicant was arrested and charged with Dangerous Drugs-\nConspiracy (Item 9). He received probation before judgment. About six weeks after \nstarting probation, he received a positive result on a urinalysis, which violated his \nprobation requirements. Subsequently, he was sentenced to four years incarceration \n(suspended) and continuation of his probation. After his probation ended in November \n1989, he continued using cocaine (Item 8). \n \n \nApplicant was treated for drug addiction from November 1987 to March 1988, \nand he did not use drugs during that time. The record is silent as to a diagnosis or \nprognosis. At about this time, he also participated in court-ordered therapy with a \npsychiatrist for approximately one year (Item 6), and attended Narcotics Anonymous \n(NA). Applicant relapsed and resumed cocaine use (Item 8).  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s pattern of cocaine use was to use the drug for three to four days, \nthen abstain for three to four weeks. This pattern continued from 1989 to about 1991. \nApplicant\u2019s spending on drugs amounted to several thousand dollars per year, and led \nto financial problems. Applicant stated during his subject interview of February 1991 \nthat he could not say with certainty that he would not use illegal drugs in the future, in \npart because he was addicted to cocaine. Applicant applied for a security clearance in \napproximately 1989, but it was denied. He was told at the time that the denial was \nbased on his drug use and the resulting financial problems (Items 4, 6). \n \n \nIn 1992, Applicant\u2019s car was stopped by a police officer, who discovered \nmarijuana. He was charged with Controlled Dangerous Substance--Possession of \nMarijuana, as well as possession of paraphernalia. In 1993, the charge was placed on \nthe stet docket (Items 6, 7). \n \n \nIn January 2009, when Applicant met with an agent from the Office of Personnel \nManagement (OPM), he stated that he first attended NA before the drug arrest in 1987. \nHe became involved with the program and held several offices. About seven to eight \nyears ago, he stopped using cocaine, and has attended NA meetings less regularly \nsince then. He also noted that he does not socialize with cocaine users, and has no \nintent to use it in the future (Item 6).  \n \n \nApplicant also informed the agent that he had stopped using marijuana about \none year before the interview, in December 2007. He stopped because it made him \nlethargic and also affected his heart. He does not associate with people who use \nmarijuana. He stated that although he had no plans to do so, there was a possibility \nthat he might use marijuana in the future. However, when he responded to a DOHA \n\n \n \n4\n                                                \nInterrogatory in July 2009, he stated, \u201cI now have no intentions of any future marijuana \nuse.\u201d (Items 5, 6). \n \nIn October 2008, when Applicant completed his security clearance application, \nhe answered \u201cNo\u201d to question 24(a), which asked if he had used illegal drugs during \nthe previous seven years. He failed to disclose that he had used marijuana as recently \nas December 2007. He explained to the investigating agent that he answered \nincorrectly because he was focusing on his cocaine use, and not thinking of his \nmarijuana use, when he completed the questionnaire (Item 6). In his Answer to the \nStatement of Reasons, he admitted that he deliberately falsified the answer in his \nsecurity clearance application (Items 3, 4). \n \nPolicies \n \n \nEach security clearance decision must be a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndetermination based on examination of all available relevant and material information, \nand consideration of the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in the Revised \nAdjudicative Guidelines (AG).4 Decisions must also reflect consideration of the \u201cwhole \nperson\u201d factors listed in \u00b6 2(a) of the Guidelines. \n \n \nThe presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not \ndeterminative of a conclusion for or against an Applicant. However, specific applicable \nguidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against them as they \nrepresent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to classified \ninformation. In this case, the pleadings and the information presented by the parties \nrequire consideration of the security concerns and adjudicative factors addressed under \nGuideline H (Drug Involvement) and Guideline E (Personal Conduct).   \n \n \nA security clearance decision is intended only to resolve the questions of whether \nit is clearly consistent with the national interest5 for an Applicant to either receive or \ncontinue to have access to classified information. The government bears the initial \nburden of producing admissible information on which it based the preliminary decision \nto deny or revoke a security clearance for an Applicant. Additionally, the government \nmust be able to prove controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If the government meets \nits burden, it then falls to the Applicant to refute, extenuate or mitigate the government\u2019s \ncase. Because no one has a \u201cright\u201d to a security clearance, an Applicant bears a heavy \nburden of persuasion.6 A person who has access to classified information enters into a \nfiduciary relationship with the government based on trust and confidence. Therefore, the \ngovernment has a compelling interest in ensuring each Applicant possesses the \n \n4 Directive. 6.3. \n5 See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988). \n6 See Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, 531. \n\n \n \n5\n                                                \nrequisite judgment, reliability and trustworthiness of one who will protect the national \ninterests as his or his own. The \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard \ncompels resolution of any reasonable doubt about an Applicant\u2019s suitability for access in \nfavor of the government.7 \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 24 expresses the security concern pertaining to drug involvement: \n \nUse of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can \nraise questions about an individual's reliability and \ntrustworthiness both because it may impair judgment and \nbecause it raises questions about a person's ability or \nwillingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \n \nOf the eight disqualifying conditions listed at AG \u00b6 25, the following apply:  \n \n(a) any drug abuse;  \n \n(b) testing positive for illegal drug use; \n \n(c) illegal drug possession, including cultivation, processing, \nmanufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia;  \n \n(h) expressed intent to continue illegal drug use, or failure to \nclearly and convincingly commit to discontinue drug use.  \n \n \nApplicant admits to illegally using illegal drugs, specifically marijuana and \ncocaine. He also purchased both drugs regularly. While on probation on a charge of \nDangerous Drug: Conspiracy, Applicant continued to use illegal drugs, and failed a \nrandom drug test. Moreover, although he now states that he has no intent to use illegal \ndrugs in the future, he told investigators in 1991 and again in 2009 that he might use \nillegal drugs in the future. These statements, as well as his use of marijuana as \nrecently as December 2007, raise doubts as to his commitment to avoid illegal drugs. \n \nAG \u00b6 26 includes three relevant mitigating conditions:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \nhappened under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \n \n7 See Egan; Revised Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 2(b). \n\n \n \n6\ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) a demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future, \nsuch as:  \n \n \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were \nused;  \n \n \n(3) an appropriate period of abstinence;  \n \n(4) a signed statement of intent with automatic revocation of \nclearance for any violation. \n \n(d) satisfactory completion of a prescribed drug treatment program, \nincluding \nbut \nnot \nlimited \nto \nrehabilitation \nand \naftercare \nrequirements, without recurrence of abuse, and a favorable \nprognosis by a duly qualified medical professional. \n \n` \nApplicant\u2019s last use of illegal drugs in December 2007 is recent. He used them \nover a period of approximately 38 years. He used illegal drugs when he was a mature \nadult, and admits that he was a cocaine addict. His recent use, at the age of 58, casts \nserious doubt on his current reliability and good judgment. AG \u00b6 26(a) does not apply. \nApplicant\u2019s conduct has not shown a clear intent to avoid drugs in the future. Although \nhe states that he does not associate with drug users, his claimed two-year abstinence \nfrom marijuana is insufficient to show rehabilitation, given his decades of past use. \nMoreover, although he completed a drug treatment program, he returned to cocaine \nand marijuana use after the program. The record Is silent as to a prognosis. AG \u00b6 26(b) \nand (d) do not apply. \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \n \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern about personal conduct: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, \ndishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations \ncan \nraise \nquestions \nabout \nan \nindividual's \nreliability, \ntrustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. Of \nspecial interest is any failure to provide truthful and candid \nanswers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \n\n \n \n7\nThe Guideline E allegations implicate the following disqualifying conditions \nunder AG \u00b6 16: \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant \nfacts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history \nstatement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, \ndetermine employment qualifications, award benefits or status, \ndetermine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or \naward fiduciary responsibilities. \n \nThe government alleges that Applicant deliberately falsified information when he \nfailed to disclose his marijuana use on his 2008 application. Given that he used \nmarijuana over a period of almost 40 years, including the period covered by question \n24(a), his statement to the investigator that he was thinking only of his cocaine use \nwhen he completed his security clearance application is not credible. Applicant admits \nit was false, and AG \u00b6 16(a) applies. \n \nMitigating condition 17(a) (the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to \ncorrect the omission, concealment, or falsification before being confronted with the \nfacts) is relevant. However, Applicant cannot claim mitigation under AG \u00b6 17(a) \nbecause he did not make an effort to correct the falsification. In fact, when he was \ninterviewed, he again falsified by lying about why he answered as he did.  \n \nWhole Person Analysis   \n  \n \nUnder the whole person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate the \nApplicant\u2019s security eligibility by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s conduct and \nall the circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative \nprocess factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nAG \u00b6 2(c) requires that the ultimate determination of whether to grant a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. Under each guideline, I \nconsidered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts \nand circumstances surrounding this case.  \n \n\n \n \n8\n \nApplicant has used marijuana and cocaine for almost 40 years. He started when \nhe was 21 years old, and last used marijuana in 2007, about two years ago, when he \nwas 58 years old. He was arrested on charges related to both drugs. Despite inpatient \ntreatment in the late 1980s, and a year of psychiatric treatment in 1988, he continued \nusing both drugs. He admits he was a cocaine addict. Applicant also deliberately \nfalsified his 2008 security clearance application. His willingness to provide false \ninformation to the government undermines the credibility of his statement that he has \nno intent to use illegal drugs in the future, and raises serious doubts about his \nsuitability for access to classified information.  \n \n \nFor all these reasons, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the security \nconcerns arising from the cited adjudicative guidelines. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline H  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a. \u2013 1.g.  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant  \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to allow Applicant access to \nclassified information.

On August 27, 2009, the Defense Office of\nHearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the\nsecurity concerns under Guideline F for the Applicant.  The action was taken under\nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February\n20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial\nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended\n(Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on\nDecember 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued\nafter September 1, 2006. \nThe Applicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on September 9, 2009.  She\nanswered the SOR in writing on September 28, 2009, and requested a hearing before\nan Administrative Judge.  DOHA received the request on December 1, 2009, and I\nreceived the case assignment that same day.

The Applicant initially denied this debt as having been\ncharged off; and as such, no longer appeared as a delinquency on her credit report.\n(TR at page 41 line 21 to page 43 line 24.)  However, at her hearing she admitted this\ncharged off debt, and has vowed to exercise due diligence in addressing the debt.  (Id.)\nHer diligence and good character is attested to by her family, friends, and those who\nknow her in the work place.  (AppX 1.)\n1.h.  It is alleged that the Applicant is indebted to Creditor H in the amount of\nabout $813.  (GX 6 at page 2.)  The Applicant admits this debt, and since January has\nbeen paying $40 each month towards this delinquency, as evidenced by\ncorrespondence to the creditor and by two cancelled checks drawn to the creditor.  (TR\nat page 43 line 25 to page 46 line 2, AppX 5 at page 7, and AppX 6 at pages 8 and 10.)\n1.i.  It is alleged that the Applicant is indebted to Creditor I in the amount of about\n$4,998.  (GX 5 at page 2.)  The Applicant admits this debt, and since January has been\npaying $50 each month towards this delinquency, as evidenced by correspondence to\nthe creditor and by three cancelled checks drawn to the creditor.  (TR at page 46 line 3\nto page 47 line 15, AppX 5 at page 6, and AppX 6 at pages 1,2 and 10.)\n1.j. and 1.k.  It is alleged that the Applicant is indebted to Creditor J in the amount\nof about $22,703, for college loans for her daughter.  (GX 5 at page 2.)  The Applicant\nadmits these debt, and these loans have been \u201cIn Forbearance\u201d from \u201c2/21/2007 to\n8/21/2010,\u201d as evidenced by documentation from the creditor.  (AppX 8.)\n\n4\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG).  In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law.  Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process.  The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and commonsense decision.  According to\nParagraph 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables\nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d  The administrative judge must consider all\navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and\nunfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration.\nParagraph 2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for\naccess to classified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d  In\nreaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical\nand based on the evidence contained in the record.  Likewise, I have avoided drawing\ninferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive Paragraph E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to\nestablish controverted facts alleged in the SOR.  Under Directive Paragraph E3.1.15,\nthe Applicant is responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut,\nexplain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department\nCounsel. . . .\u201d  The Applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a\nfavorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence.  This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours.  The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information.  Decisions include, by necessity, consideration\nof the possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information.  Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d  See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).\n\n5\nAnalysis\nGuideline F - Financial Considerations\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set\nout in Paragraph 18:\nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and\nmeet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment,\nor unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information.  An individual who is financially\noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate\nfunds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns.  Under\nSubparagraph 19(a), an \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially\ndisqualifying.  Similarly under Subparagraph 19(c), \u201ca history of not meeting financial\nobligations@ may raise security concerns.  The Applicant owes about $8,297 in past due\nindebtedness.\nThese are countered by the Mitigating Conditions found in Subparagraphs 20(b)\nand 20 (d).  Under Subparagraph 20(b), it may be mitigating where \u201cthe conditions that\nresulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of\nemployment . . . or a death), and the individual acted responsibly under the\ncircumstances.@  Furthermore, Subparagraph 20(d) applies where the evidence shows\n\u201cthe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise\nresolve debts.@ The loss of the Applicant\u2019s mother in 1997, her father-in-law in 2002,\nand her husband\u2019s unemployment in 2002, caused her financial difficulties.  Given these\ncircumstances, I find that she has acted responsibly.  She has now addressed all but\none of her past due debts through monthly payments, and vows due diligence in\naddressing the $1,700 charged off debt.\nWhole-Person Concept\nUnder the whole-person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances.  Under Paragraph 2(c), the ultimate determination of\nwhether to grant eligibility for a security clearance must be an overall commonsense\njudgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person\nconcept.  Here, she has the unqualified support of her family, friends and colleagues,\nwho attest to her due diligence and good character.  (AppX 1.)\n\n6\nThe Administrative Judge should also consider the nine adjudicative process\nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nI considered all of the evidence, including the potentially disqualifying and\nmitigating conditions surrounding this case.  Overall, the record evidence leaves me\nwithout questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security\nclearance.  For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant mitigated the security concerns\narising from her financial considerations.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a.~1.k:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.\nRichard A. Cefola\nAdministrative Judge\n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact In Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he denied all the allegations. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant is 40 years old. He is married and has no children. He is a consultant to a federal contractor. He works in the information technology field (IT). This is the first time he has sought a security clearance. He has deployed to both Iraq and Afghanistan as a federal contractor supporting United States forces in those locations.1 The SOR alleges that Applicant failed to file his 2005-2007 federal and state tax returns (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.b), and that he owes $11,347 to a government agency on a collection account (SOR \u00b6 1.c). In 1999, Applicant suffered a workplace injury for which he sought workman\u2019s compensation. Additionally, because of the injury suffered, he applied for and received social security disability benefits. Beginning in either late 2000 or early 2001, he received social security benefits in the amount of $1,000 per month. In October of 2001, he was able to resume employment and contacted the Social Security Administration (SSA) to stop his disability payments. According to the Applicant, he received his last benefit check in about December 2001. The SSA claims that he continued receiving benefit checks for an extended period.

Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance is granted. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn January 19, 2010, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) \nissued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations. DOHA acted under Executive Order 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nadjudicative guidelines (AG), effective within the Department of Defense on  \nSeptember 1, 2006.  \n \nNovember 26, 2010\n\n \n2 \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s answer to the SOR was received by DOHA on April 5, 2010, and he \nelected to have his case decided on the written record. Department Counsel submitted \nthe Government\u2019s File of Relevant Material (FORM) on June 28, 2010. The FORM was \nmailed to Applicant and he received it on August 1, 2010. Applicant was given an \nopportunity to file objections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation. \nIn response to the FORM, Applicant provided an undated letter and an email dated \nAugust 25, 2010. The case was assigned to me on October 19, 2010.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he denied all the allegations. After a thorough \nand careful review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings \nof fact. \n \n \nApplicant is 40 years old. He is married and has no children. He is a consultant to \na federal contractor. He works in the information technology field (IT). This is the first \ntime he has sought a security clearance. He has deployed to both Iraq and Afghanistan \nas a federal contractor supporting United States forces in those locations.1   \n \n \n \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant failed to file his 2005-2007 federal and state tax \nreturns (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.b), and that he owes $11,347 to a government agency on a \ncollection account (SOR \u00b6 1.c). In 1999, Applicant suffered a workplace injury for which \nhe sought workman\u2019s compensation. Additionally, because of the injury suffered, he \napplied for and received social security disability benefits. Beginning in either late 2000 \nor early 2001, he received social security benefits in the amount of $1,000 per month. In \nOctober of 2001, he was able to resume employment and contacted the Social Security \nAdministration (SSA) to stop his disability payments. According to the Applicant, he \nreceived his last benefit check in about December 2001. The SSA claims that he \ncontinued receiving benefit checks for an extended period. There is no SSA \ndocumentation of these payments other than the entries on Applicant\u2019s credit reports \nshowing a government debt as a collection account.2 \n \n \n \nIn either 2004 or 2005, Applicant received a letter from the SSA asking him to \ncontact them. He did so and was informed he had received an overpayment of benefits. \nApplicant claims he did not receive any additional payments after December 2001. After \nupdating his address with the SSA in May 2005, Applicant received several checks from \nthe SSA in excess of $40,000. Applicant knew he was not entitled to these checks and \nimmediately contacted the SSA about the overpayments. He did not cash the checks. In \nMarch 2006, Applicant returned all the checks to the SSA he had received to date, \namounting to $42,396. The SSA maintains that Applicant received a total of $53,743 in \noverpayment benefits and he still owes $11,374. Applicant disputes owing this amount \nand hypothesizes the SSA sent the disputed checks to an incorrect address because he \n                                                          \n1 Item 5. \n \n2 Items 4, 13. \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \nhas never received those checks. As of July 2009, Applicant and the SSA were working \nto schedule a mediation to resolve this dispute. Applicant\u2019s overseas work schedule has \ncomplicated scheduling the mediation.3  \n \n \nBecause of the disputed social security amounts, which the IRS was treating as \nincome, Applicant did not file his 2005-2007 federal or state income tax returns at the \ntime they were due. He hired an accounting firm to sort out his tax issues. He has \nprovided documentation showing he has filed and paid his 2005-2007 federal and state \nincome tax obligations. Applicant filed and paid his federal returns in August, September \nand November 2009. He filed and paid his state returns in October and November \n2009. All these actions preceded the issuance of the SOR in this case.4 \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d  \n \n                                                          \n3 Items 4, 9, 10, 13. \n \n4 Items 4; Response to FORM. \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nAG & 18 expresses the security concern for financial considerations:  \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. I have \nconsidered all of them under AG & 19 and especially considered the following: \n \n(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and \n \n(g) failure to file annual Federal, state, or local income tax returns as required or \nthe fraudulent filing of the same.  \n \nApplicant has an $11,347 delinquent debt that remains unpaid or unresolved. He \nalso failed to timely file both his federal and state income tax returns for 2005-2007. I \nfind both disqualifying conditions have been raised.  \n \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns \narising from financial difficulties. I have considered all of the mitigating conditions under \nAG \u00b6 20 and especially considered the following: \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control;  \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \n \nApplicant resolved both his federal and state tax obligations for the years in \nquestion by November 2009 when he filed and paid what he owed. His failure to timely \nfile his tax returns happened under unusual circumstances, namely, the inclusion of \nsocial security benefits as taxable income by the IRS, and is unlikely to recur. \nAdditionally, his delayed filing of taxes (until an accountant could sort things) out does \nnot cast doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. I find mitigating \ncondition AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a) and 20(c) apply to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b.  \n \n \nApplicant has a reasonable basis to dispute the remaining social security debt. \nHe claims he never received the money in question. His turning over $40,000 worth of \nchecks to the SSA that he received through their bureaucratic error persuades me that \nhe did not receive the additional checks. Based upon his previous track record, I can \ninfer that had he received them, he would have also turned them back over to the SSA. \nHe also is currently seeking mediation for this disputed debt. I find AG \u00b6 20(e) applies to \nSOR \u00b6 1.c.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I considered the circumstances by \nwhich the SSA mistakenly sent him funds to which he was not entitled. I considered how \nhe promptly returned those funds. I also considered how that error by the SSA impacted \nhis tax obligations for the next several years. Finally, I considered Applicant\u2019s \ndeployments to hostile places in support of United States military forces. Applicant \nprovided sufficient evidence to mitigate the security concerns.  \n \nOverall the record evidence leaves me with no questions or doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant mitigated the security concerns arising under Guideline F, Financial \nConsiderations. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.c: \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Under Guideline F, the Government alleged that Applicant owes approximately $361,539 for eight delinquent debts (SOR 1.a - 1.h). In response to the SOR, Applicant admitted with explanation all of the SOR allegations. Having reviewed Applicant\u2019s response to the SOR, the transcript, and exhibits, I make the following findings of relevant fact. Applicant is 30 years old and employed by a defense contractor. She requires a security clearance to perform the duties of her position as a contracts administrator. Applicant has worked directly for her current employer since December 2003.

Duffy, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nMALONE, Matthew E., Administrative Judge:\nBased upon a review of the pleadings, exhibits, and transcript, Applicant\u2019s\nrequest for a security clearance is denied.\nOn July 30, 2008, Applicant submitted a Questionnaire for Sensitive Positions\n(SF 86) to obtain a security clearance required for her job with a defense contractor.\nAfter reviewing the results of the ensuing background investigation, adjudicators for the\nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued to Applicant two sets of\ninterrogatories  to clarify or augment information about potentially disqualifying\n1\ninformation in her background. After reviewing the results of the background\ninvestigation and Applicant\u2019s responses to the interrogatories, DOHA adjudicators were\nunable to make a preliminary affirmative finding  that it is clearly consistent with the\n2\nMay 24, 2010\n\n The adjudicative guidelines were implemented by the Department of Defense on September 1, 2006.\n3\nPending official revision of the Directive, they take precedence over the guidelines listed in Enclosure 2 to the\nDirective.\n2\nnational interest to grant Applicant\u2019s request for access to classified information. On\nAugust 27, 2009, DOHA issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging\nfacts which, if proven, raise security concerns addressed in the adjudicative guidelines\n(AG)  for financial considerations (Guideline F).\n3\nApplicant timely responded to the SOR and requested a hearing. The case was\nassigned to me on December 18, 2009. Pursuant to a Notice of Hearing issued on\nDecember 30, 2009, I convened a hearing in this matter on January 19, 2010. The\nparties appeared as scheduled. The Government presented five exhibits (Gx. 1 - 5),\nwhich were admitted without objection. Applicant testified on her own behalf and\nproffered five exhibits, which were admitted without objection as Applicant\u2019s Exhibits\n(Ax.) A - E. DOHA received the transcript of hearing (Tr.) on January 27, 2010. The\nrecord closed on February 2, 2010, when I received Applicant\u2019s post-hearing\nsubmissions that are admitted collectively as Ax. F.\nFindings of Fact\nUnder Guideline F, the Government alleged that Applicant owes approximately\n$361,539 for eight delinquent debts (SOR 1.a - 1.h). In response to the SOR, Applicant\nadmitted with explanation all of the SOR allegations. Having reviewed Applicant\u2019s\nresponse to the SOR, the transcript, and exhibits, I make the following findings of\nrelevant fact.\nApplicant is 30 years old and employed by a defense contractor. She requires a\nsecurity clearance to perform the duties of her position as a contracts administrator.\nApplicant has worked directly for her current employer since December 2003. She\nworked as a temporary employee on the same contract from September 2001 until\nbeing hired as a regular employee. Applicant transferred from a previous location (City\nA) to her current location in July 2008. She transferred to follow her husband, who took\na new job in City B. Applicant currently makes about $52,000 annually, but may be\npromoted this year to a contracts negotiator position making about $65,000. (Gx. 1; Tr.\n91)\nApplicant\u2019s job performance has been excellent. Multiple professional and\npersonal references cite her good character, honesty, and reliability as the bases for\ntheir recommendations that she be granted a security clearance. (Ax. D)\n \nApplicant has a bachelor\u2019s degree in journalism and a master\u2019s degree in mass\ncommunications. She owes about $54,000 in student loans that are in forbearance until\nOctober 2010. At that time she estimates her monthly payments will be about $400. (Tr.\n86 - 87, 95)\n\n3\nShe and her husband have been married since August 1999. They have two\nchildren, ages five and three. (Gx. 1) Applicant\u2019s husband has earned his living as a\nsalesman in several different areas. When they relocated to City B in July 2008, he was\nselling and re-selling time shares. However, he has been largely unemployed since\nabout December 2008, when the position for which he moved was eliminated due to\nmarket declines. (Tr. 61 - 62, 75)\nApplicant and her husband enjoyed good financial health from the beginning of\ntheir marriage until late 2007. They had some credit card debt early in their marriage,\nbut they made a concerted effort to pay it off and to avoid credit card use. They bought\na house for use as their primary residence in May 2004. They financed the purchase\nthrough a $146,000 fixed-rate 30-year loan. Their rate was 4.8%. Their income at that\ntime was about $80,000 annually and they had no difficulty meeting their mortgage and\nother regular obligations. (Tr. 44 - 48, 60)\nIn 2006, Applicant\u2019s husband, who had been working in telecommunications\nsales, decided to explore real estate investing based on what some of his friends were\nexperiencing in the market. He wanted to buy homes, fix them up, and sell them for a\nprofit. In October 2006, he and Applicant bought a house for $180,000, which appraised\nfor $220,000. They obtained a $150,000 adjustable rate mortgage at 16%. They also\nobtained a $58,000 home equity line of credit (HELOC) against their primary residence\nand used $30,000 for the remainder of the purchase price. They also obtained a\nHELOC on the investment property to fund improvements thereto. The first mortgage on\nthe investment property also had a balloon payment provision, but Applicant could\nprovide few details about this part of the transaction. She was pregnant with their\nyounger child and left the matter largely to her husband. However, they both reviewed\ninformation about comparable local sales and the appraisal of the property they were\nbuying. (Tr. 49 - 51, 57 - 58, 99 - 100)\nApplicant and her husband put their investment property on the market in\nDecember 2006. However, they soon realized the house would not sell for their asking\nprice, which was based on the earlier $220,000 appraisal. At first, they blamed their\nrealtor, but they had no success after changing agents. In her answer to the SOR and at\nthe hearing, Applicant implied that the appraisal was fraudulent. (Tr. 52) After they put\nthe house on the market, they received an appraisal that showed the house was worth\nabout $145,000. They were able to make the monthly mortgage, taxes, and insurance\npayment of about $1,600 until December 2007. At that point, they were again using\ncredit cards and could not make all four mortgage payments. They also could not pay\nthe homeowners\u2019 association dues associated with the investment property. (Tr. 59 -\n60)\nIn July 2008, as noted above, Applicant and her husband decided to move to\ntheir current location in City B. Applicant\u2019s employer agreed to transfer her to a job at\nthis location at the same pay. Her husband\u2019s new job selling time shares was supposed\nto pay more than his previous position; however, the market for time shares soon dried\nup and he lost his job. Additionally, they were unable to sell their primary residence in\nCity A. They stopped paying both mortgages on that house in June 2008. (Tr. 61 - 62) It\nwent to foreclosure in late 2008 and was sold for $148,139 in March 2009. (Ax. C)\n\n See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988).\n4\n Directive. 6.3.\n5\n4\nAvailable information shows that the second mortgages on both properties were\ncharged off by the lenders as business losses. The loans were not likely to be satisfied\nin the event of foreclosure because the properties were going to be sold for less than\nthe first mortgage in each instance. The primary lender for each property would have\nfirst claim to any sale proceeds leaving nothing for the secondary loans. Applicant has\nnot satisfied either of the HELOCs and the first mortgage on her investment property\nremains unresolved as there has been no sale yet. (Ax. F)\nWhen she submitted her application for a security clearance, she disclosed the\ndelinquent mortgages she and her husband incurred. She also described her efforts to\nresolve those mortgages through persistent efforts to sell both properties. They\nrepeatedly reduced the asking price on each property. They also attempted to reach\nshort sale agreements on both to no avail. (Gx. 1; Gx. 2; Ax. F)\nThe smaller debts alleged in the SOR (1.a - 1.c) also remain unpaid. SOR 1.a is\na disputed charge of $283 for an overdrawn bank account last discussed with the bank\nin 2008, when Applicant\u2019s husband was still working. (Tr. 36 - 39) SOR 1.b is a $35\ncharge for a cable television box that Applicant claims her husband returned when they\nmoved in 2008. (Tr. 39 - 40) SOR 1.c is an unpaid credit card with a balance due of\n$2,178 that has been delinquent since October 2008. As of the hearing, Applicant was\n\u201cputting together a plan\u201d to resolve this debt. (Tr. 41 - 42)\nApplicant has enrolled in a debt management and financial counseling service.\n(Ax. A) However, there is as yet no record of repayment or other action to resolve her\ndebts through this service. A recent assessment of Applicant\u2019s finances shows that she\nand her husband, who was still unemployed as of the hearing, are covering their current\nmonthly obligations. However, after paying all of their monthly expenses, it appears they\nare living paycheck to paycheck. In October 2009, their car was repossessed after they\nmissed three months of payments. (Tr. 81 - 84) They have reduced their rent through an\nagreement with their landlord, but it is likely to increase when their lease is up later in\n2010. Applicant did not present any information about how she would be able to pay\nmore rent and make her monthly student loan payments when they come due.\nPolicies\nA security clearance decision is intended to resolve whether it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest  for an applicant to either receive or continue to\n4\nhave access to classified information. Each decision must be a fair, impartial, and\ncommonsense determination based on examination of all available relevant and\nmaterial information,  and consideration of the pertinent criteria and adjudication policies\n5\nin the adjudicative guidelines. Decisions must also reflect consideration of the factors\nlisted in \u00b6 2(a) of the new guidelines. Commonly referred to as the \u201cwhole-person\u201d\nconcept, those factors are:\n\n See Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, 531.\n6\n See Egan; Revised Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 2(b).\n7\n5\n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nThe presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not, by itself,\nconclusive. However, specific applicable guidelines should be followed whenever a case\ncan be measured against them as they represent policy guidance governing the grant or\ndenial of access to classified information. In this case, the pleadings and the information\npresented by the parties require consideration of the security concerns and adjudicative\nfactors addressed under AG \u00b6 18 (Guideline F - Financial Considerations).\nThe Government bears the initial burden of producing admissible information on\nwhich it based the preliminary decision to deny or revoke a security clearance for an\napplicant. Additionally, the Government must be able to prove controverted facts\nalleged in the SOR. If the Government meets its burden, it then falls to the applicant to\nrefute, extenuate or mitigate the Government\u2019s case. Because no one has a \u201cright\u201d to a\nsecurity clearance, an applicant bears a heavy burden of persuasion.  A person who\n6\nhas access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with the\nGovernment based on trust and confidence. Thus, the Government has a compelling\ninterest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgment, reliability, and\ntrustworthiness of one who will protect the national interests as his or her own. The\n\u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any\nreasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the Government.7\nAnalysis\nFinancial Considerations\nThe security concern about Applicant\u2019s finances, as stated in AG \u00b6 18, is that:\nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.\n\n6\nThe Government presented sufficient information to support the allegations in\nSOR \u00b6 1.a - 1.h; that is, that Applicant owed $361,539 for eight delinquent debts.\nAvailable information showed that she has not yet paid or resolved her debts. The two\nHELOC debts (SOR 1.f and 1.g) have been written off by the lenders of those accounts.\nOne home mortgage (SOR 1.e) has been resolved through foreclosure and subsequent\nsale. But another mortgage of $150,000 (SOR 1.d) and unpaid homeowners association\ndues of $4,182 (SOR 1.h) remain Applicant\u2019s responsibility. The debts at SOR 1.a - 1.c,\nwhich have been delinquent for more than two years and total just under $2,500, also\nremain unresolved. Accordingly, the record requires application of the disqualifying\nconditions listed at AG \u00b6 19(a) (inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts) and AG \u00b6\n19(c) (a history of not meeting financial obligations).\nIn response to the SOR and at hearing, Applicant established that her husband\nhas been under-employed or out of work entirely for more than about two years. The\nrecord also shows that their foray into real estate investments failed, in large measure,\nbecause of an inaccurate appraisal of the property they bought and an unforeseen\nfailure in the housing market. Applicant further demonstrated that she and her husband\nacted with reasonable diligence in trying to sell or otherwise resolve their interest in the\ninvestment property. These facts require consideration of the mitigating condition at AG\n\u00b6 20(b) (the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the\nperson's control (e.g. loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical\nemergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual acted responsibly\nunder the circumstances). However, the record does not support its application because\nof Applicant\u2019s decision to move to their current location. Given the problems\nexperienced in trying to sell the investment property, Applicant knew or should have\nknown that it would be equally as difficult to sell her primary residence. Even if her\nhusband\u2019s new job had worked out, there is nothing in the record to show that they\nwould have been able to support themselves in their new location and still meet the\nmortgage and HELOC obligations on the primary residence they were leaving.\nThe other mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 do not apply because Applicant\ndid not establish that she has paid even the smallest of her debts. The fact that she is\nno longer obligated for the mortgage and HELOC on her primary residence is due solely\nto the lender\u2019s foreclosure of the first mortgage and subsequent sale of the property,\nand due to a business loss charge-off of the HELOC. Further, Applicant has not\nestablished that her financial health is any better or that it will improve. To the contrary,\nit appears that Applicant will not be able to meet her obligations when her student loans\ncome due and her rent increases later in 2010. Finally, although Applicant has enrolled\nin a debt counseling and repayment service, she has not presented an agreed upon\nrepayment plan or track record of debt payment. On balance, I conclude that the\nsecurity concerns about her unpaid debt are not mitigated.\nWhole-Person Concept\nI have evaluated the facts presented and have applied the appropriate\nadjudicative factors under Guideline F. I have also reviewed the record before me in the\ncontext of the whole-person factors listed in AG \u00b6 2(a). Available information shows that\nApplicant, 30 years old, is a mature, responsible wife and mother. She has a record of\n\n See footnote 5, supra.\n8\n See footnote 7, supra. \n9\n7\nsteady, reliable employment through which she has established an excellent personal\nand professional reputation. She has worked hard to earn two degrees in her chosen\nfield, and her employer lauds her professionalism and integrity. She was candid at all\ntimes about her finances, and the facts yielded through her background investigation\nand this adjudication show that Applicant and her husband may have been victims of\nbad luck who were duped by an overly liberal appraisal of their investment property. On\nthe other hand, the same facts show that they did not do their homework before they\nbought the property and that they overextended themselves both in the 2006 purchase\nand when they decided to move in 2008. Applicant\u2019s lack of action regarding smaller\ndelinquencies, the likely worsening of her financial circumstances in the next year, and\nthe ongoing presence of significant delinquent mortgage obligations make unacceptable\nthe risk of granting Applicant access to classified information. The favorable information\nin Applicant\u2019s background is insufficient to overcome that risk. A fair and commonsense\nassessment  of all available information bearing on Applicant\u2019s past and current\n8\ncircumstances shows she has not addressed satisfactorily the Government\u2019s doubts\nabout her ability and willingness to protect the Government\u2019s interests as her own.\nBecause protection of the national interest is paramount in these determinations, such\ndoubts must be resolved for the government.9\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by section\nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.h:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the foregoing, it is not clearly consistent with the national interest\nto continue Applicant\u2019s access to classified information.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nJames R. Fleisher, Esq.\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On July 31, 2009, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the\nbasis for that decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline C (Foreign Preference) and\n\n1The Judge found in Applicant\u2019s favor regarding SOR \u00b6 1(c), a Guideline C allegation, which stated, \u201cYou\nmaintain your [European country] citizenship to protect your interest in social security benefits you earned while\nemployed [there].\u201d  Accordingly, this allegation is not at issue in this appeal.  \n2\nGuideline B (Foreign Influence) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as\namended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.  On June 15, 2010, after the hearing,\nAdministrative Judge Philip S. Howe denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant\nappealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether certain of the Judge\u2019s findings of\nfact were based upon substantial record evidence; whether the Judge erred in his application of the\nGuideline C disqualifying conditions (FPDC) and the Guideline B disqualifying conditions (FIDC);\nwhether the Judge erred in his application of the pertinent mitigating conditions; whether the Judge\u2019s\nwhole-person analysis was in error; and whether the Judge\u2019s adverse security clearance decision was\narbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.1  Consistent with the following discussion, we affirm the\ndecision of the Judge.\nFacts\nThe Judge made the following pertinent findings of fact: Applicant is an engineer working\nfor a Defense contractor.  He was born in Iran, but he moved to a European country in the late 1970s\nto attend college.  He received a Bachelor\u2019s degree and a Master\u2019s degree from universities in that\ncountry, where he lived from the late 1970s until the late 1990s.  He became a citizen of this\nEuropean country and earned retirement benefits due to his having worked there for ten years.  \nHe left this country in the late 1990s and moved to the U.S.  He became a U.S. citizen in the\nlate 2000s.  Applicant holds citizenship in Iran, the European country, and the U.S.  He also has\npassports from these three countries.  He has traveled to Iran several times after moving to the U.S.\n\u201cApplicant traveled to Iran after he received the SOR . . . knowing that his travels to Iran and\npossession of the Iranian passport were a security concern to the U.S. Government.\u201d  Decision at\n3.  \nHis wife is an Iranian citizen living with him in the U.S.  His mother is a citizen and resident\nof Iran.  Applicant speaks to her over the telephone once a month.  He also has siblings who are\ncitizens of Iran.  One of them has a spouse who \u201cmay work\u201d in an Iranian military office.  Decision\nat 4.  He speaks with his siblings several times a year.\nIran and the U.S. have not had diplomatic relations since 1980.  Iran supports both\ninternational terrorism and violent opposition to the Middle-East peace process.  It has intervened\nin the internal affairs of Iraq.  The U.S. has designated Iran as the most active state sponsor of\nterrorism.    \nDiscussion\nFactual Sufficiency  \n\n2We review the Judge\u2019s findings of facts to determine if they are supported by substantial evidence\u2013\u201csuch\nrelevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary\nevidence in the same record.\u201d  Directive  \u00b6 E3.1.32.1\n3See Note 1 above.  The only Guideline C allegations at issue in this appeal are the two which alleged that\nApplicant exercises dual citizenship between the U.S. and Iran and the European country respectively insofar as he\npossesses current passports from those countries.  \n4Directive, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 10(a)(1): \u201cpossession of a current foreign passport[.]\u201d\n5Directive, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 10(a)(3): \u201caccepting educational, medical, retirement, social welfare, or other such\nbenefits from a foreign country[.]\u201d  \n3\nApplicant contends that certain of the Judge\u2019s findings of fact are not based upon substantial\nrecord evidence.2  Specifically, he challenges the Judge\u2019s finding that he had traveled to Iran after\nhaving received the SOR in his case.  We can find no record evidence of Applicant\u2019s having traveled\nto that country after July 31, 2009, the date of the SOR.  Therefore, Applicant is correct that the\nJudge\u2019s finding is in error.  However, Applicant\u2019s last trip to Iran occurred after his security\nclearance interview and after receipt of DOHA interrogatories, which should have placed him on\nnotice of security concern arising from his use of foreign passports.  Accordingly, we conclude that\nthis error by the Judge is harmless.  See ISCR Case No. 09-00629 at 2 (App. Bd. Jul. 30, 2010).\nApplicant also challenges the Judge\u2019s finding that he had never stated that he would\nrenounce his foreign citizenships.  Again, Applicant is correct.  He stated during the hearing that he\nwould renounce his European country citizenship should that be necessary.  Tr. at 64.  He also\nadvised the security clearance investigator that he would be willing to renounce both citizenships\nif required.  Interview Summary at 3, 8, contained in Government Exhibit 2, Interrogatories, dated\nApril 15, 2009.  However, in light of the totality of the record evidence, we conclude that, even if\nhe had not made this factual error, the Judge\u2019s ultimate decision would have been the same.\nTherefore, this error is harmless.\nJudge\u2019s Treatment of the Disqualifying Conditions\nApplicant contends that the Judge erred in concluding that the record evidence establishes\nsecurity concerns under Guideline C.3  Specifically, he argues that FPDC 10(a)(1)4 is not applicable\nbecause he does not currently possess his foreign passports.  Rather, he had turned them over to his\nfacility security officer (FSO) prior to the hearing.  He also argues that FPDC 10(a)(3)5 is not\napplicable because he has not actually received any retirement benefits from the European country.\nHowever, Applicant\u2019s arguments rely on an overly technical reading of the Directive.  The\ndisqualifying conditions are examples of the kind of circumstances that can give rise to security\nconcerns.  They are not to be considered exhaustive.  See ISCR Case No. 08-11788 at 3 (App. Bd.\nJul. 28, 2010).  In this case, Applicant\u2019s citizenship in two foreign countries; his prior holding of\n\n6In circumstances where a passport has been surrendered to a security official, Directive, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 11(e),\na mitigating condition, may also apply, as in this case.  See our discussion under Judge\u2019s Treatment of the Mitigating\nConditions below.  \n7Directive, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 11(e): \u201cthe passport has been destroyed, surrendered to the cognizant security\nauthority, or otherwise invalidated[.]\u201d  \n4\nforeign passports;6 his renewal of his Iranian passport at each opportunity, even after obtaining U.S.\ncitizenship; and his apparently vested right to future social security payments from a foreign country\nconstitute sufficient evidence of foreign preferences for the Judge to apply disqualifying conditions\nunder Guideline C.  \n  Applicant also challenges the Judge\u2019s conclusion that the Government had established\nGuideline B disqualifying conditions.  However, the Iranian citizenship of his wife and the Iranian\ncitizenship and residence of several of Applicant\u2019s close relatives, to include in-laws, is sufficient\nto raise Foreign Influence concerns.  See ISCR Case No. 01-26893 (App. Bd. Oct. 16, 2002) (There\nis a rational connection between an applicant\u2019s family ties in a country whose interests are adverse\nto the United States and the risk that the applicant might fail to protect and safeguard classified\ninformation.)  See also ISCR Case No. 05-03250 at 4-5 (App. Bd. Apr. 6, 2007); ISCR Case No. 04-\n11463 at 4 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (In Foreign Influence cases, the nature of the foreign\ngovernment involved, the intelligence gathering history of that government, and the presence of\nterrorist activity are important considerations that provide context for the other record evidence and\nmust be brought to bear on the Judge\u2019s ultimate conclusions in the case.)  Accordingly, the Judge\nproperly concluded that Applicant\u2019s circumstances raised concerns under Guidelines C and B, which\nplaced upon Applicant the burden of persuasion as to mitigation.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. \nJudge\u2019s Treatment of the Mitigating Conditions\nApplicant contends that the Judge erred in his application of the pertinent mitigating\nconditions.  In his argument concerning Guideline C, Applicant discusses record evidence which\nappears to raise the applicability of FPMC 11(e).7  He cites to testimony in which Applicant\ndiscussed the circumstances surrounding his decision to turn his two foreign passports over to his\nFSO.  Applicant testified that he was called by a DOHA Department Counsel (not the one who\nactually represented the Government in this case), who advised Applicant to give the passports to\nthe FSO.  Tr. at 58.  In his brief, Applicant contends that he \u201cfollowed [Department Counsel\u2019s]\ninstructions exactly\u2013he gave the passports to his FSO to hold\u2013a fact which is now being held against\nhim.  The Judge criticized the Applicant at the hearing for failing to destroy the passports.\u201d\nApplicant Brief at 6.  \nThere is no other evidence in the record regarding this alleged advice, either in rebuttal or\nexplanation.  Moreover, Department Counsel did not provide a reply brief.  As it stands, therefore,\nthe record contains uncontradicted testimony that, in turning his passports over to his FSO,\nApplicant was relying upon advice from a DOHA official.  Under the circumstances, we conclude\nthat the Judge erred in not extending favorable application to FPMC 11(e), insofar as Applicant, in\n\n5\napparent good faith, surrendered his passport to his employer\u2019s security authority.  On the other\nhand, we find no error in the Judge\u2019s treatment of the mitigating conditions under Guideline B.  \nOther Issues\nWe note Applicant\u2019s argument, toward the beginning of his brief, in which he quotes the\ninterview summary prepared by the security clearance investigator.  The quoted language states,\namong other things, that Applicant has no preference for any foreign country over the U.S. and that\nhe has received no benefits by virtue of his status as a citizen of a foreign country or by virtue of his\nforeign relatives.  To the extent that Applicant\u2019s brief assumes that the quotations reflect the\njudgement of the investigator, the brief is in error.  The quoted language merely summarizes what\nApplicant told the investigator, not the investigator\u2019s personal conclusions about Applicant\u2019s\nsecurity issues.  We conclude that the Judge\u2019s whole person analysis complies with the requirements\nof Directive, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 2, in that the Judge considered the totality of Applicant\u2019s conduct in\nreaching his decision. See ISCR Case No. 08-02464 at 3 (App. Bd. Jul. 16, 2009); ISCR Case No.\n05-03948 at 3-4 (App. Bd. May 21, 2007).\n After reviewing the record, the Board concludes that the Judge examined the relevant data\nand articulated a satisfactory explanation for the decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between\nthe facts found and the choice made.\u2019\u201d  Motor Vehicle Mfrs.

He was born in Iran, but he moved to a European country in the late 1970s to attend college. He received a Bachelor\u2019s degree and a Master\u2019s degree from universities in that country, where he lived from the late 1970s until the late 1990s. He became a citizen of this European country and earned retirement benefits due to his having worked there for ten years. He left this country in the late 1990s and moved to the U.S. He became a U.S. citizen in the late 2000s. Applicant holds citizenship in Iran, the European country, and the U.S. He also has passports from these three countries. He has traveled to Iran several times after moving to the U.S. \u201cApplicant traveled to Iran after he received the SOR . . . knowing that his travels to Iran and possession of the Iranian passport were a security concern to the U.S. Government.\u201d Decision at 3. His wife is an Iranian citizen living with him in the U.S. His mother is a citizen and resident of Iran. Applicant speaks to her over the telephone once a month.

Iran and the U.S. have not had diplomatic relations since 1980. Iran supports both international terrorism and violent opposition to the Middle-East peace process. It has intervened in the internal affairs of Iraq. The U.S. has designated Iran as the most active state sponsor of terrorism.

Benson, Esquire, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: James Fleisher, Esquire \n \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nHOWE, Philip S., Administrative Judge: \n \nOn August 25, 2008, Applicant submitted his security clearance application (SF \n86). On July 31, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued \nApplicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under Guidelines \nC (Foreign Preference) and B (Foreign Influence). The action was taken under \nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February \n20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \n(Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) effective within the Department of \nDefense on September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on August 14, 2009, and requested a \nhearing before an administrative judge. DOHA issued a Notice of Hearing on October 7, \n2009, setting the hearing for October 22, 2009. On October 14, 2009, the previously \nassigned administrative judge granted Applicant\u2019s request for a delay until he could hire \ncounsel. DOHA issued a cancellation of that hearing on October 20, 2009.  \n \n \n1 \n \n \nJune 15, 2010\n\n \n2 \n \n \nI received the case assignment on October 21, 2009. DOHA issued a second \nNotice of Hearing on December 2, 2009, and I convened the hearing as scheduled on \nDecember 15, 2009. The Government offered Exhibits 1 through 3, which were received \nwithout objection. Applicant testified and submitted Exhibits A through F, which were \nreceived without objection. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on January 4, \n2010. I granted Applicant\u2019s request to keep the record open until January 5, 2010, to \nsubmit additional matters.  On that day, he submitted Exhibits G-1 to G-4 and a revised \nExhibit B, without objection from Department Counsel. The record closed on January 5, \n2010. Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility \nfor access to classified information is denied. \n \nProcedural and Evidentiary Rulings \n \nMotion to Amend SOR \n \nDepartment Counsel moved to amend the SOR by adding to \u00b6 1.a \u201cSeptember 3, \n2007,\u201d as the issuance date for Applicant\u2019s current Iranian passport, which is valid \nthrough \u201cSeptember 2, 2012.\u201d Applicant\u2019s counsel had no objection to this amendment \nand I granted the request. (Tr. 108, 109.)  \n \nRequest for Administrative Notice \n \nDepartment Counsel submitted a formal request that I take administrative notice \nof certain facts relating to Iran. (Tr. at 10-12.) The request and the attached documents \nwere admitted into evidence as Hearing Exhibit 3. Applicant\u2019s counsel argued that Sub- \nExhibits XIII, XIV and XV were irrelevant and immaterial because they pertain to certain \nindividuals of Iranian origin who were prosecuted under United States laws for various \ncrimes. (Tr. 18, 19.) The Department Counsel asserted that the information was offered \nto show that Iran is an active collector of classified information. I admitted the \ndocuments and allowed Applicant to submit other exhibits pertaining to Iran which were \nmarked as Exhibits G-1 to G-4. The facts administratively noticed are set out in the \nFindings of Fact, below.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the factual allegations in \u00b6 1.b, and \nParagraph 2 of the SOR, with explanations. He denied the factual allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1. a \nand 1.c of the SOR. He also provided additional information to support his request for \neligibility for a security clearance.   \n \n \nApplicant is 55 years old. He was born in Iran. His father is deceased and his \nmother is 80 years old. She is a citizen of Iran and lives there. Applicant telephones her \nonce a month. He married his second wife in 2006 and has a child born on November \n12, 2008, in the U.S. They live in the United States. Applicant departed Iran when he \nwas 21 years old to obtain college and masters degrees in England. His current \n\n \n3 \n \n \nemployment is as a staff engineer for a defense contractor. (Tr. 24-28, 45, 81, 82, 84, \n102; Exhibits 1, 2.) \n \n \nApplicant came to the United States (U.S.) in 1997 after working in England since \n1977. He is a mechanical engineer. During those 20 years, Applicant traveled to Iran \nannually or biennially to visit his mother and other family members. Applicant became a \ncitizen of the United Kingdom (U.K.) in 1990. He has a British passport that expires in \nOctober 2015. Applicant wanted to immigrate to the United States to work in a better job \nmarket. He travelled to the United States on a work visa (H-1) in 1997. He then obtained \na \u201cgreen card\u201d and later United States citizenship on February 7, 2007. Applicant \nobtained a U.S. passport on Mach 16, 2007. Applicant has tripartite  citizenship with the \nU.K., Iran, and the U.S.  He maintains his U.K. citizenship to obtain his pension benefits \nearned while working in the U.K. for 10 years. (Tr. 28-39, 66; Exhibits 1, 2, C-E.) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s spouse is 38 years old. Applicant\u2019s son has a U.S. passport. His \nspouse was born in Iran and has Iranian citizenship with a \u201cgreen card\u201d in the U.S. She \ncame to the U.S. three years ago after they were married. He met her in Iran on one of \nhis earlier trips to visit his family. They own a home in the U.S. and have their bank \naccounts in the U.S. They do not have any foreign investments or bank accounts. Her \nparents are alive and live in Iran. Applicant talks to his father-in-law several times a \nmonth when his wife telephones her parents. (Tr. 39-42, 62, 78, 88, 93, 94; Exhibits 1, \n2, F.) \n \nApplicant renewed his Iranian passport in September 2007, which is valid until \nSeptember 2012. He originally obtained the passport when he was 18 years old. \nApplicant renewed the Iranian passport after he became a U.S. citizen, though he may \nhave completed the application before he became a U.S. citizen. He did so, in order to \nenter Iran, which will not recognize any foreign passport for an individual born in Iran. \nHe retains the passport so he can visit his family. Applicant traveled to Iran in June \n2002 and 2003. Also, he went to Iran in June 2005, April 2006, July 2006, January \n2007. After becoming a U.S. citizen, he used his Iranian passport to enter and exit Iran \nin the April and September 2009, after using his U.S. passport to fly to Europe. He has \nnot used his Iranian passport for travel to any other country. Applicant traveled to Iran \nafter he received the SOR in July 2009, knowing that his travels to Iran and possession \nof the Iranian passport were a security concern to the U.S. Government. (Tr. 51-59, 70-\n72.) \n \nAt the hearing, Applicant stated he was willing to relinquish and destroy the U.K \nand Iranian passports, if necessary. Applicant surrendered his U.K. and Iranian \npassports to his company\u2019s security officer on September 8, 2009, after someone \nadvised him to do so.  Applicant did not state he would renounce either the U.K. or \nIranian citizenships, just that he would allow the passports to be destroyed to obtain a \nsecurity clearance. He asked his security officer if he could be allowed to retain the \npassports. Applicant is also willing to conduct his foreign travel using only his U.S. \npassport. He has no present plans to return to Iran in the future, except to attend his \n\n \n4 \n \n \n                                                          \nmother\u2019s funeral when that event occurs. (Tr. 48, 49, 59, 61-64, 67-69, 89. 92, 98, 105-\n107, 113; Exhibits 1, 2, B, B-1, C, D, E.) \n \nApplicant also has three sisters and three brothers still living. They were born in \nIran. The oldest brother, the fourth brother, died several years ago. The youngest \nbrother lives in England and Applicant has not seen or spoken to him in several years. \nApplicant\u2019s siblings are married to Iranian citizens, except for his youngest brother who \nlives in the U.K. Two brothers live in Iran. One brother and his wife are teachers, \nemployed by the Iranian government. Applicant contacts them about every three \nmonths. Another brother works in an office and he is a widower. Applicant has not seen \nhim for five years. Applicant\u2019s three sisters live in Iran. A sister is a housewife. He has \nnot seen her since his wedding in 2007. That sister\u2019s husband may work in an Iranian \nNavy office. Applicant\u2019s second sister is a housewife married to a children\u2019s clothing \nmanufacturer. His third sister is 60 years old. Her husband sold shoes for a living. \nApplicant\u2019s father-in-law is a tailor. He lives in Iran and is a citizen. Applicant\u2019s mother-\nin-law is a citizen and resident of Iran. He speaks with his siblings several times a year. \n(Tr. 82-88; Exhibits 1, 2.)  \n \nApplicant proclaimed his loyalty to the U.S. He does not have any financial \ninterests outside the U.S. He acknowledged it is expensive to travel to Iran, even on his \n$83,000 annual income. (Tr. 65, 93, 102) \n \nI take administrative notice of the following facts regarding Iran: \n \nIran is a constitutional Islamic republic with a theocratic system of government in \nwhich Shi\u2019a Muslim clergy dominate the key power structures, and ultimate political \nauthority is vested in a learned religious scholar. The U.S. has not had diplomatic \nrelations with Iran since 1980. 1 \n \nThe U.S. Government has defined the areas of objectionable Iranian behavior as: \n(1) Iran\u2019s efforts to acquire nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction; \n(2) Its support for and involvement in international terrorism; (3) Its support for violent \nopposition to the Middle East peace process; (4) Its dismal human rights record; and (5) \nIran\u2019s intervention in the internal affairs of Iraq.2 The U.S. has designated and \ncharacterized Iran as the most active state sponsor of terrorism. Iran provides critical \nsupport to non-state terrorist groups.3 \n \nThe government of Iran has committed numerous, serious human rights abuses \nagainst the Iranian people. Abuses include political killings and incarceration; summary \nexecutions, including of minors; disappearances; religious persecution; torture; arbitrary \n \n1 U.S. Department of State, Background Note: Iran, dated March 2008 and 2009. \n \n2 Id.  \n \n3U.S. Department of State, State Sponsors of Terrorism, April 30, 2009, and December 14, 2009.  \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \n                                                          \narrest and detention, including prolonged solitary confinement; denial of due process; \nsevere restrictions on civil liberties - speech, press, assembly, association, movement \nand privacy; severe restrictions on freedom of religion; official corruption; violence and \nlegal and societal discrimination against women, ethnic and religious minorities, and \nhomosexuals; trafficking in persons; and child labor.4  \n \nThe State Department continues to warn U.S. citizens to consider carefully the \nrisks of travel to Iran. U.S. citizens, who were born in Iran and are the children of Iranian \ncitizens, even those without Iranian passports who do not consider themselves Iranian, \nare considered Iranian citizens by Iranian authorities, since Iran does not recognize dual \ncitizenship. Therefore, despite the fact that these individuals hold U.S. citizenship, under \nIranian law, they must enter and exit Iran on an Iranian passport, unless the Iranian \ngovernment has recognized a formal renunciation or loss of Iranian citizenship. U.S.-\nIranian dual nationals have been denied permission to enter and depart Iran using their \nU.S. passports; they even had their U.S. passports confiscated upon arrival or \ndeparture. U.S.-Iranian dual citizens have been detained and harassed by the Iranian \ngovernment. Iranian security personnel may place foreign visitors under surveillance. \nHotel rooms, telephones and fax machines may be monitored, and personal \npossessions in hotel rooms be searched.5 \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \n \n4U. S. Department of State, 2009 Human Rights Report: Iran, Country Reports on Human Rights \nPractices, dated February 25, 2009.  \n \n5 U.S. Department of State, Travel Warning: Iran, dated July 1, 2009. \n\n \n6 \n \n \non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information.  Decisions include, by necessity, consideration \nof the possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline C, Foreign Preference \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 9 the security concern involving foreign preference arises: \n \nWhen an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference \nfor a foreign country over the United States, then he or she may be prone \nto provide information or make decisions that are harmful to the interests \nof the United States. \n \nAG \u00b6 10 describes four conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying: \n \n(a) exercise of any right, privilege or obligation of foreign citizenship \nafter becoming a U.S. citizen or through the foreign citizenship of a family \nmember.  This includes but is not limited to: \n \n(1) possession of a current foreign passport;  \n \n(3) accepting educational, medical, retirement, social welfare, or           \nother such benefits from a foreign country; \n\n \n7 \n \n \n \n(4) residence in a foreign country to meet citizenship requirements; \nand \n \n(5) using foreign citizenship to protect financial or business \ninterests in another country. \n \n Applicant was born in Iran. He arrived in the United States in 1997 and became \na naturalized U.S. citizen in February 2007. He obtained a U.S. passport on March 16, \n2007. In September 2007, he renewed his previously issued Iranian passport, which he \nwas able to do because he was born in that country. Renewing his passport was an \naction he took in order to obtain recognition of Iranian citizenship, so he could travel \nthere. Between June 2002 and September 2009, he used that passport to enter and exit \nIran for his own convenience, including after he became a U.S. citizen in 2007. He \npossesses that passport, which will not expire until September 2012, though he \nsurrendered it to his security officer in September 2009. AG \u00b6 10 (a)1 applies. \n \nApplicant also has a U.K. passport because he is a citizen of the U.K. and lived \nthere from 1977 to 1997. He retained that passport so he could continue the future \nopportunity to collect government retirement benefits from that government. As stated \nabove, he renewed his Iranian passport to make it easier for him to enter Iran to visit his \nfamily. AG \u00b6 10 (a) 3, (a) 4, and (a) 5 apply.  \n \nAfter the Government raised a potential disqualification, the burden shifts to \nApplicant to establish any appropriate mitigating condition. AG \u00b6 11 provides four \nconditions that could mitigate security concerns: \n \n(a) dual citizenship is based solely on parents' citizenship or \nbirth in a foreign country; \n \n(b) the individual has expressed a willingness to renounce \ndual citizenship; \n \n(c) exercise of the rights, privileges, or obligations of foreign \ncitizenship occurred before the individual became a U.S. \ncitizen or when the individual was a minor; and \n \n (e) the passport has been destroyed, surrendered to the \ncognizant security authority, or otherwise invalidated. \n \n Applicant was born in Iran. His citizenship is derived from that circumstance. \nHowever, over the past 33 years he has renewed his Iranian passport at each \nopportunity to do so, even after he obtained U.K and U.S. citizenships. His dual \ncitizenship is based on that action. AG \u00b6 11(a) does not apply. Moreover, he moved \nvoluntarily to the U.K. and lived there for 20 years. AG \u00b6 11(a) does not apply to that \ncitizenship.   \n\n \n8 \n \n \nApplicant recently expressed a willingness to relinquish his Iranian and U.K. \npassports, if it were necessary for him to do so to obtain a security clearance and \nmaintain his employment. He did not state he would renounce both foreign citizenships. \nIn fact, he asked his security officer if he could retain his passports and citizenships \nwhile having a U.S. security clearance. AG \u00b6 11(b) does not apply.  \n \nApplicant accumulated U.K. pension credits before moving to the U.S. in 1997 \nand becoming a U.S. citizen in 2007. He wants to collect them in the future and \nintended to do so for the past three years after he became a U.S. citizen. AG \u00b6 11(c) \ndoes not apply \n \nBoth of Applicant\u2019s foreign passports were surrendered to his security officer in \nSeptember 2009. He surrendered them only after he was advised to do so. They have \nnot been destroyed, though Applicant testified he is willing to have them destroyed and \nuse only his U.S. passport for foreign travel.  AG \u00b6 11(e) partially applies . \n \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \n \nAG \u00b6 6 expresses the security concern regarding foreign influence: \n \nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the \nindividual has divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be \nmanipulated or induced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or \ngovernment in a way that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to \npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Adjudication under this \nGuideline can and should consider the identity of the foreign country in \nwhich the foreign contact or financial interest is located, including, but not \nlimited to, such considerations as whether the foreign country is known to \ntarget United States citizens to obtain protected information and/or is \nassociated with a risk of terrorism. \n \nAG \u00b6 7 describes four conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying: \n \n(a) contact with a foreign family member, business or professional \nassociate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a \nforeign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign \nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation to \nprotect sensitive information or technology and the individual's desire to \nhelp a foreign person, group, or country by providing that information; \n \n\n \n9 \n \n \n                                                          \n(d) sharing living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of \ncitizenship status, if that relationship creates a heightened risk of foreign \ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion;6; \n \n(e) a substantial business, financial, or property interest in a foreign \ncountry, or in any foreign-owned or foreign-operated business, which \ncould subject the individual to heightened risk of foreign influence or \nexploitation. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s wife and five siblings are Iranian citizens and residents. His other \nbrother is an Iranian citizen living in the U.K. Applicant\u2019s wife lives in the United States  \nwith him and their child. All of Applicant\u2019s siblings except one live in Iran. He has \ntraveled to Iran eight times in the past twelve years, and seven trips occurred in the past \nsix years. One of the latest trips occurred after Applicant received the SOR expressing \nthe Government\u2019s concern about his foreign preferences and foreign influence. These \nfrequent trips, coupled with the Iranian government\u2019s anti-American actions and \nstatements, give rise to security concerns that if Applicant had access to classified \ninformation he could be subject to a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, \nmanipulation, pressure, or coercion by the Iranian authorities. AG \u00b6 7 (a) and (b) apply.  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s mother and in-laws are also Iranian citizens and residents. Their \npresence in Iran and Applicant\u2019s work in the U.S. could create a heightened risk of \nforeign inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion by Iranian authorities based on \ntheir past human rights violations. The Iranian authorities could pressure Applicant\u2019s \nrelatives to get Applicant to disclose classified information to keep them safe from \ncriminal penalties or harassment by the Iranian authorities. AG \u00b6 7(d) applies.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s pension benefits from the U.K. are a substantial financial interest in \nthe U.K. Applicant could be subject to foreign influence or exploitation to keep access to \nthose benefits. AG \u00b6 7(e) applies. \n \nAfter the Government raised a potential disqualification, the burden shifted to \nApplicant to establish any appropriate mitigating condition. AG \u00b6 8 provides conditions \nthat could mitigate security concerns: \n \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \n \n6 The mere possession of close family ties with a person in a foreign country is \nnot, as a matter of law, disqualifying under Guideline B. However, if only one relative \nlives in a foreign country and an applicant has contacts with that relative, this factor \nalone is sufficient to create the potential for foreign influence and could potentially result \nin the compromise of classified information. See ISCR Case No. 03-02382 at 5 (App. \nBd. Feb. 15, 2006); ISCR Case No. 99-0424 (App. Bd. Feb. 8, 2001). \n \n\n \n10 \n \n \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nU.S.; \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual's sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country is \nso minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships \nand loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any \nconflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest; \n \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation; and \n \n(f) the value or routine nature of the foreign business, financial, or property \ninterests is such that they are unlikely to result in a conflict and could not \nbe used effectively to influence, manipulate, or pressure the individual.  \n \n \nIran\u2019s bellicose statements and actions in recent years, and the lack of diplomatic \nrelations with the U.S., coupled with Applicant\u2019s close familial relations with his mother \nand siblings, make it more likely than not that Applicant could be placed in a position of \nhaving to choose between the interests of his family and the theocratic government of \nIran, and the interests of the United States.  His frequent trips to Iran using his Iranian \npassport make him vulnerable to coercion by that government. AG \u00b6 8 (a) does not \napply.  \n \n \nApplicant lived in Iran for 18 years until moving to the U.K. for higher education \ndegrees. He lived in the U.K. for 20 years and became a citizen while retaining his \nIranian citizenship. Then, Applicant immigrated to the United States in 1997 for better \neconomic and job opportunities. In 2007, he became a U.S. citizen while retaining for \npension reasons his U.K. citizenship and passport, and his Iranian citizenship and \npassport for his personal travel convenience to Iran. Applicant owns a home in the \nUnited States and has no foreign financial interests except his U.K. pension benefits. \nHis foreign pension and familial interests create a conflict of interest. He does not have \na long-lasting and deep relationship to the United States. He has spent only the last 13 \nyears in the United States, the least amount of time that he has lived in any of the three \ncountries in which he holds citizenship. Therefore, he cannot be expected to resolve \nany conflict in favor of the U.S.  AG \u00b6 8(b) does not apply. \n \n \nApplicant has frequent contacts with his mother in Iran. He also has frequent \ncontacts with his siblings there, through telephone and travel over the years. Those \ncontacts are not casual or infrequent. AG \u00b6 8(c) does not apply. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s U.K. pension benefits exist. Applicant did not disclose the amount of \nthose present or future benefits. The United Kingdom is a long-standing ally of the \nUnited States, dating back to before World War I. Those pension benefits are the usual \n\n \n11 \n \n \nand common payments any worker could obtain with 20 years of work in the U.K. It is \nunlikely that they could result in a conflict of interest or be used to influence Applicant by \nthe U.K. government, which does not engage in espionage against the United States. \nAG \u00b6 8 (f) applies.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of an applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \nAG \u00b6 2(c) requires each case must be judged on its own merits.  Under AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance \nmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nguidelines and the whole-person concept. The Appeal Board requires the whole-person \nanalysis address \u201cevidence of an applicant\u2019s personal loyalties; the nature and extent of \nan applicant\u2019s family ties to the U.S. relative to his [or her] ties to a foreign country; his \nor her social ties within the U.S.; and many others raised by the facts of a given case.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 04-00540 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan. 5, 2007).         \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. Six circumstances weigh against \nApplicant in the whole-person analysis.   \n \nFirst, there is a significant risk of terrorism and human rights abuses in Iran. More \nimportantly for security purposes, terrorists are hostile to the United States and actively \nseek classified information. Terrorists could attempt to use Applicant\u2019s mother, his \nsiblings, and his in-laws to obtain such information.  \n \nSecond, he had numerous connections to Iran before he immigrated to the U.K. \nand then the United States. Following his birth, he spent his formative years there until \nhe was 18 years old.  \n \nThird, all of his family members are citizens of Iran. Only one brother lives \noutside of Iran.  \n \n\n \n12 \n \n \nFourth, he visited family in Iran eight times in twelve years between 2002 and \n2009 using his Iranian passport for two of those trips after becoming an American \ncitizen. \n \nFifth, Applicant has lived in the United States for only 13 years, and has been a \nnaturalized citizen for three years. These periods are the least amount of time he has \nspent in a country from which he holds a passport, and claims citizenship. The evidence \nshows that Applicant moves around the world for his economic benefit, not from any \nloyalty or love for the United States. \n \nSixth, and most importantly, he traveled to Iran in spite of being placed on notice \nby the Government that his possession of an Iranian passport and travel there created a \npotential security risk.  \n \nApplicant did not mitigate the foreign preference and foreign influence security \nconcerns. Overall, the record evidence leaves doubt as to Applicant\u2019s present eligibility \nand suitability for a security clearance. I conclude the \u201cwhole-person\u201d concept against \nApplicant.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline C:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline B:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.b:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.c:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.d:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.e:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.f:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.g:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n13 \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

Accordingly, her request for a security clearance is granted. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-\nQIP), signed on September 2, 2008. After reviewing the results of the ensuing \nbackground investigation, adjudicators for the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals \n(DOHA) were unable to make a preliminary affirmative finding1 that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance. \n \n1 Required by Executive Order 10865, as amended, and DoD Directive 5220.6 (Directive), as amended. \nFebruary 24, 2010\n\n \n \n2\n                                                \n \n \nOn August 7, 2009, DOHA issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) \nthat specified the basis for its decision: security concerns addressed in the Directive \nunder Guideline B (Foreign Influence) of the Revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG).2 \nApplicant signed her notarized Answer to the SOR on September 2, 2009, in which she \nadmitted to all the allegations in the Statement of Reasons. She also requested a \nhearing before an administrative judge. \n \nDepartment Counsel was prepared to proceed on October 1, 2009, and the case \nwas assigned to me on October 9, 2009. DOHA issued a Notice of Hearing on \nNovember 6, 2009, and I convened the hearing as scheduled on December 8, 2009. \nDuring the hearing, Department Counsel offered two exhibits, which were marked and \nadmitted as Government Exhibits (GE) 1 and 2. Applicant testified and offered eight \nexhibits, which I marked and admitted as Applicant Exhibit (AE) A through H. DOHA \nreceived the transcript (Tr.) on December 17, 2009. \n \nProcedural Ruling \n \n \nDepartment Counsel requested that I take administrative notice of facts relating \nto Taiwan, set forth in a summary marked as Hearing Exhibit (HE) I, with 15 attached \ndocuments. The facts administratively noticed are limited to matters of general \nknowledge and not subject to reasonable dispute. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions to the SOR are incorporated herein as findings of fact. \nAfter a thorough review of the pleadings, Applicant\u2019s response to the SOR, and the \nrecord evidence, I make the following additional findings of fact. \n \nApplicant, 35 years old, was born in Taiwan and earned a bachelor\u2019s degree \nthere in 1996. She immigrated to the United States in 1997, at the age of 23, to further \nher education. In 1999, she earned a master\u2019s degree in Business Administration at a \nU.S. university. She became a U.S. citizen in July 2008, and received her U.S. passport \nin September 2008.3 She has worked for the same federal defense contractor since \n1999, receiving the highest performance ratings. (GE 1; AE D, E; Tr. 52-54, 60) \n \n2 Adjudication of this case is controlled by the Revised Adjudicative Guidelines, approved by the \nPresident on December 29, 2005, which were implemented by the Department of Defense on \nSeptember 1, 2006. The Revised Adjudicative Guidelines supersede the guidelines listed in Enclosure 2 \nto the Directive, and they apply to all adjudications or trustworthiness determinations in which an SOR \nwas issued on or after September 1, 2006. \n \n3 At her security interview, Applicant informed the agent that she held a valid Taiwanese passport, which \nshe had last used in 2006, before becoming a U.S. citizen. As a result of the interview, she realized that \nthe foreign passport represented a security concern for the government, and promptly destroyed it at her \nhome. A short time later, she received a letter informing her of the proper method to destroy it. She sent \n\n \n \n3\n                                                                                                                                                           \n \nApplicant married in 2003. Her husband and his family are U.S. citizens. He is a \npetty officer in the Navy, and has held a security clearance since 1994. Their daughter, \naged three, was born in the United States (GE 1; AE H; Tr. 35, 41). \n \n \nWhen Applicant lived in Taiwan, she had a strong attachment to her \ngrandfather, who raised her while her mother worked. Applicant traveled to Taiwan to \nvisit her ailing grandfather in 1999 and 2000, and then in 2002 to attend his funeral. \nApplicant testified that after he died, she had little reason to return to Taiwan, and has \nonly visited once since then, in 2006. When there, she stays with her mother (AE B; Tr. \n48-49, 72)  \n \nApplicant\u2019s divorced parents are citizens and residents of Taiwan. Her mother, \n60 years old, was born in Taiwan and resides there. She was self-employed as an \ninternet service provider and has no contact with the Taiwanese government. She \nretired in 2007 because she planned to spend more time in the United States with \nApplicant's daughter. Although Applicant\u2018s relations with her mother are strained, they \nhave been in touch frequently since the birth of Applicant's daughter in 2006. Applicant \nstated in her security interview that she talks with her mother about 3 times per week \nand emails once every two weeks. Applicant\u2019s husband testified that she talked to \nfamily in Taiwan about once per week before her grandfather died in 2002, and \ncurrently talks with her mother about once every two weeks. Applicant's mother came \nto the United States about three to five times per year between 2006 and 2008 to take \ncare of Applicant's daughter. In 2009, she visited twice. Her last visit occurred in \nSeptember 2009 when she came to accept her permanent resident card. (GE 2; AE B; \nTr. 29, 39, 45-46, 65, 68-69) \n \nApplicant sponsored her mother for permanent U.S. resident status. As of the \ndate of the hearing, her mother has been approved for permanent resident status and \nhas received a \u201cgreen card.\u201d Applicant's mother is aware that Applicant is applying for a \nsecurity clearance. (GE 2; AE F, G; Tr. 46). \n \nApplicant\u2019s mother owns a home and two income properties in Taiwan. She \nplans to sell them in anticipation of moving to the United States. As of the hearing date, \nshe had obtained a buyer for one property, and had contacted a realtor to sell the \nsecond property. When both are sold, she will sell her residence. (Tr. 47, 69-70). \n \nApplicant's father, 62 years old, was born in China (PRC) and is a citizen and \nresident of Taiwan. Applicant thinks he used to be a salesman, but is unaware of his \ncurrent employment. She spoke to him in approximately 1997, when she moved to the \nUnited States. After 1997, she saw him at her grandfather\u2019s funeral in 2002, and then \ndid not speak to him again until 2008, when her mother requested it. \u201cI have been \n \na notarized letter indicating that she had already destroyed it (the record does not indicate the addressee \nof the letter).

Before \nshe retired, she was a doctor. Applicant used to talk with her by telephone \napproximately twice per month. However, she currently suffers from Alzheimer\u2019s \ndisease, and resides in a community home in Taiwan.4 Applicant has not been able to \nsee or speak to her since early 2006. She has no other family in Taiwan. Applicant has \nan aunt and uncle who are naturalized U.S. citizens and live in the United States. \nApplicant does not provide financial support to any family members. She has a 401(k) \naccount through her company and an individual retirement account. Her husband will \nreceive a Navy pension in the future (GE 1, 2; AE A; Tr. 72-74, 76, 79). \n \nAdministrative Notice \n \nI take administrative notice of the following facts derived from the documents \nsubmitted for administrative notice. Taiwan is a multi-party democracy. The United \nStates does not support Taiwan independence, in keeping with the \u201cone China\u201d policy. \nHowever, it continues to maintain strong unofficial relations with Taiwan. The United \nStates supports Taiwan\u2019s membership in appropriate international organizations where \nstatehood is not a requirement for membership and also supports its meaningful \nparticipation in appropriate international organizations. \n \n \nTaiwan and the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) have significant economic \nties, which are attributable to their physical proximity and history. Because of its \nlocation, Taiwan has a particular interest in information from the United States that \ncould aid it in its own defense. Taiwan\u2019s primary defense goal is to deter invasion from \nthe PRC. The PRC maintains intelligence operations in Taiwan through a bureau \nutilizing PRC nationals with Taiwanese connections.  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nEach security clearance decision must be a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndetermination based on examination of all available relevant and material information, \nand consideration of the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in the Revised \nAdjudicative Guidelines (AG).5 Decisions must also reflect consideration of the \u201cwhole \nperson\u201d factors listed in \u00b6 2(a) of the Guidelines. \n \n \nThe presence or absence of disqualifying or mitigating conditions does not \ndetermine a conclusion for or against an applicant. However, specific applicable \n \n4 Applicant's family has moved her grandmother between Singapore and Taiwan, but as of the date of \nthe hearing, she was living in Taiwan. (Tr. 79) \n5 Directive. 6.3. \n\n \n \n5\n                                                \nguidelines are followed when a case can be so measured, as they represent policy \nguidance governing the grant or denial of access to classified information.  \n \n \nA security clearance decision is intended only to resolve the question of whether \nit is clearly consistent with the national interest6 for an applicant to receive or continue \nto have access to classified information. The government bears the initial burden of \nproducing admissible information on which it based the preliminary decision to deny or \nrevoke a security clearance. Additionally, the government must be able to prove \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. If the government meets its burden, it falls to \napplicants to refute, extenuate or mitigate the government\u2019s case. Because no one has \na \u201cright\u201d to a security clearance, applicants bear a heavy burden of persuasion.7 A \nperson who has access to classified information enters a fiduciary relationship based on \ntrust and confidence. The government has a compelling interest in ensuring that \napplicants possess the requisite judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness to protect the \nnational interest as her or her own. The \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d \nstandard compels resolution of any reasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for \naccess to classified information in favor of the government.8 \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \n \nAG \u00b6 6 expresses the security concern pertaining to foreign influence:  \n \nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the \nindividual has divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be \nmanipulated or induced to help a foreign person, group, \norganization, or government in a way that is not in U.S. interests, or \nis vulnerable to pressure or coercion by any foreign interest. \nAdjudication under this Guideline can and should consider the \nidentity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or \nfinancial interest is located, including, but not limited to, such \nconsiderations as whether the foreign country is known to target \nUnited States citizens to obtain protected information and/or is \nassociated with a risk of terrorism. \n \nThe relevant disqualifying conditions are AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a), 7(b) and 7(e): \n \n \n6 See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988). \n7 See Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, 531. \n8 See Egan; Revised Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 2(b).  \n \n\n \n \n6\n(a) contact with a foreign family member, business or professional \nassociate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a \nforeign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign \nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country \nthat create a potential conflict of interest between the individual's \nobligation to protect sensitive information or technology and the \nindividual's desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by \nproviding that information. \n \nApplicant has foreign family ties through her parents and grandmother, who live \nin Taiwan. She has visited Taiwan four times since 1999, and she stays with her \nmother during these visits. Such ties do not automatically disqualify an Applicant from \nobtaining a security clearance. However, Taiwan both maintains defenses against the \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China, and has economic ties to it based on history and proximity.   \nFamily ties in Taiwan raise security concerns because of the potential for foreign \ninfluence. AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a) and 7(b) apply. \n \nThe foreign influence guideline also includes factors that can mitigate security \nconcerns. Under AG \u00b6 8, the following mitigating conditions are relevant:  \n \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a \nforeign individual, group, organization, or government and the interests \nof the United States; \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual's sense \nof loyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or \ncountry is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the U.S., that the individual \ncan be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. \ninterest; \n \nApplicant has three family members in Taiwan: her father, mother, and \ngrandmother. She has been estranged from her father for several years and has no \ncurrent relationship with him. Her grandmother suffers from Alzheimer\u2019s disease. The \nremaining family member, Applicant's mother, is the primary concern. However, she is \nretired, and even when employed, she did not have a high-profile or government-\nrelated job. Moreover, she is in the process of obtaining U.S. citizenship, and planning \nto move the United States to be with her granddaughter. It is unlikely that Applicant \nwould be exploited because of any of her three family members in Taiwan. Mitigating \ncondition AG \u00b6 8(a) applies.  \n\n \n \n7\n \nApplicant has an ambivalent relationship with her mother. Although they have \nstrained interactions when they are together, Applicant did help her mother obtain U.S. \npermanent residency. Their relationship rests primarily on Applicant's mother\u2019s desire \nto maintain ties with Applicant's daughter. On the other hand, Applicant's longstanding \nties to the United States weigh in her favor when evaluating the question of potential \nconflicts of interest. She earned an advanced degree here. She married a U.S. service \nmember, and her daughter is a native-born U.S. citizen. She has retirement accounts \nhere. She has provided support to the federal government for more than ten years \nthrough her job with a defense contractor. I conclude that she would choose these \nstrong U.S. ties over her foreign connections, in the event that a conflict of interest \narose. AG \u00b6 8(b) applies. \n \nWhole Person Analysis   \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate the \nApplicant\u2019s security eligibility by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s conduct and \nall the relevant circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nAG \u00b6 2(c) requires that the ultimate determination of whether to grant a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. Under the cited \nguideline, I considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of \nall the facts and circumstances surrounding this case.  \n \n \nForeign family ties raise security concerns because of the potential for conflicts \nof interest and exploitation. Here, Applicant\u2019s ongoing relationship with her mother in \nTaiwan raises such concerns. She is in frequent contact with her mother, and she has \ntraveled to Taiwan four times since 1999. However, Applicant\u2019s strong ties to the \nUnited States through her education, her husband, her daughter, and her investments \nrepresent substantial ties to the United States. She has provided support to federal \ncontracts since 1999. Given Applicant's significant ties to the United States, I conclude \nthat she would resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the United States.   \n \n\n \n \n8\n \nOverall, the record evidence satisfies the doubts raised concerning Applicant\u2019s \nsuitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant has \nmitigated the security concerns arising from the cited adjudicative guidelines. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a. - 1.d.:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to allow Applicant access to \nclassified information.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro se\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On August 28, 2009, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of\n\nThe SOR contained ten allegations relating to Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties.  The Judge made formal\n1\nfindings in Applicant\u2019s favor on seven of the allegations.  Those favorable findings are not at issue on appeal. \nDirective, Enclosure 2, \u00b6 20(d). \n2\n2\nthe basis for that decision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations)\nof Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant\nrequested a hearing.  On May 20, 2010, after the hearing, Administrative Judge Richard A. Cefola\ndenied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant timely appealed pursuant to the\nDirective \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raises the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge erred by concluding that\nthere was insufficient evidence to establish that Applicant initiated a good-faith effort to repay\noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.   For the following reasons, the Board affirms the\n1\nJudge\u2019s unfavorable decision. \nThe Judge made the following findings pertinent to the issue raised on appeal: Applicant is\nliable for a credit card debt in the amount of about $14,377.  Applicant stated that he would address\nthis admitted debt, but, despite having been given two months after his hearing to do so, he has\nsubmitted nothing in this regard.  This debt has not been addressed, and as such, is still outstanding.\nApplicant filed his federal tax return for tax year 2004 in January of 2008.  In March of 2010,\nApplicant retained counsel to address the $27,855 owed in back taxes for tax year 2004.  This\ncounsel is in the initial process of gathering the necessary financial data and income source\ninformation to address the debt.  Applicant filed his state income tax returns for tax years 2005 and\n2006 in August 2009.  In March 2010 Applicant retained counsel to address the $16,059 owed in\nback taxes for tax years 2005 and 2006.  The Judge reached the following conclusions: With his\nretirement from the Navy, Applicant\u2019s income was substantially reduced, and he could not keep\npaying on his credit card and his children\u2019s college loan payments.  There is not enough evidence\nto show that he initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.2\nApplicant has offered nothing to show that he has addressed his significant credit card debt and he\nhas only recently begun to address his state and federal back taxes, which are substantial.  Applicant\nhas not mitigated the security concerns arising from his financial considerations.  \nApplicant takes issue with the Judge\u2019s analysis of the $14,000 credit card debt, stating the\nJudge overlooked and did not consider evidence submitted by him that demonstrated he was\naddressing the debt, and that progress was being made toward its resolution.  Applicant points to a\ndocument that he sent to the Judge during a period post-hearing when the record was held open to\nallow Applicant to present additional matters.  The document purports to be a settlement agreement\nbetween Applicant and attorneys representing the creditor and contains an assertion that an initial\npayment toward debt retirement had been made.  \nA Judge is presumed to have considered all the evidence in the record unless he or she\nspecifically states otherwise.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 07-00196 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 20, 2009);\nISCR Case No. 07-00553 at 2 (App. Bd. May 23, 2008).  In this case, the Judge found that Applicant\n\nAt the hearing, Applicant testified that he might have owed as much as $50,000 in back taxes, even though he\n3\ndenied the government\u2019s allegations regarding back taxes in his answer to the SOR. Tr. at p. 83.  Other than his assertions\nin the SOR and on appeal, there is nothing in the record that undercuts the Judge\u2019s findings regarding the income tax\narrearages. \n3\nsubmitted nothing with regard to the issue of addressing the debt.  Given Applicant\u2019s submission,\nincluded in the record as Applicant\u2019s Exhibit D, the Judge\u2019s finding is error.  Given the Judge\u2019s\nlanguage, it is not clear to the Board whether or not the Judge considered the evidence.  Before\nremanding the case to the Judge, however, the Board must evaluate the error in light of the evidence\nsubmitted and the record as a whole to determine whether the error is harmful.  \nApplicant\u2019s Exhibit D is a one page letter authored by Applicant and supposedly submitted\nto a law firm representing the creditor.  It begins, \u201cThis memo is drawn up to document the\narrangement made over the phone between me and your representative . . . , concerning case # . . .\npreviously held as a . . . account.\u201d  The letter goes on to make various unilateral representations by\nApplicant about the nature of the agreement and the fact that an initial payment was made.  The date\nof the letter indicates that it was prepared two months after the hearing at the very end of the time\nframe afforded Applicant to submit additional documents.  The letter is unsigned.  Given these\nattributes, the probative value of the exhibit is not high.  The exhibit does not carry nearly the\nprobative force of a signed agreement executed by both parties or other evidence clearly establishing\na mutual understanding between the parties and the making of an initial payment.  The burden was\non Applicant to demonstrate matters in mitigation regarding this debt.  After considering the exhibit\nalong with the evidentiary record as a whole, the Board concludes that even if the Judge failed to\nconsider Applicant\u2019s Exhibit D, that failure would not have affected the ultimate outcome of the\ncase, as the Judge could have reasonably concluded that the exhibit did not satisfy Applicant\u2019s\nburden of establishing mitigation.  Thus, the Judge\u2019s error was harmless.     \nThe Board construes Applicant\u2019s arguments regarding his tax accounts to be that he either\nowes much less in back taxes than the government alleges, or, in the case of the state taxes, he now\nowes nothing at all.   Applicant also asserts that his efforts in getting the tax disputes resolved have\n3\nbeen ongoing and are therefore mitigating.  Much of Applicant\u2019s argument regarding delinquent\ntaxes is based on representations and documentary evidence that are not part of the evidentiary\nrecord.  The Board cannot consider new evidence on appeal.  Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.29.\nAfter a review of the record, the Board concludes that there is substantial evidence to support the\nJudge\u2019s finding that Applicant owed federal and state tax arrearages as alleged in the SOR, and that\nthe amounts are substantial.  The record also reasonably supports the Judge\u2019s conclusion that\nApplicant has only recently begun to address his delinquent income taxes and that these efforts are\nnot of sufficient magnitude to mitigate the government\u2019s security concerns.\n \nAs the trier of fact, the Judge has to weigh the evidence as a whole and decide whether the\nfavorable evidence outweighs the unfavorable evidence, or vice versa.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-\n10320 at 2 (App. Bd. Nov. 7, 2007).  A party\u2019s disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the\nevidence, or an ability to argue for a different interpretation of the evidence, is not sufficient to\n\n4\ndemonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence or reached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-17409 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2007). \nIn this case, the Judge weighed the mitigating evidence offered by Applicant against the seriousness\nof the disqualifying conduct and considered the possible application of relevant conditions and\nfactors.  He adequately discussed why the disqualifying conduct established under Guideline F was\nnot mitigated.\nThe Board does not review a case de novo.  The favorable evidence cited by Applicant is not\nsufficient to demonstrate the Judge\u2019s decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g.,\nISCR Case No. 06-11172 at 3 (App. Bd. Sep. 4, 2007).  After reviewing the record, the Board\nconcludes that the Judge examined the relevant data and articulated a satisfactory explanation for\nhis decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.\u2019\u201d Motor\nVehicle Mfrs.

Nagel, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro se\nMay 20, 2010\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nCEFOLA, Richard A., Administrative Judge:\nThe Applicant submitted his Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations\nProcessing (e-QIP) on July 2, 2008.  On August 28, 2009, the Defense Office of\nHearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the\nsecurity concerns under Guideline F for the Applicant.  The action was taken under\nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February\n20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial\nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended\n(Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on\nDecember 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued\nafter September 1, 2006. \nThe Applicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on September 4, 2009.  He\nanswered the SOR in writing (Response) on October 13, 2009, and requested a hearing\nbefore an Administrative Judge.  DOHA received the request on December 1, 2009, and\nI received the case assignment that same date.  DOHA issued a notice of hearing on\nDecember 7, 2009, and I convened the hearing as scheduled on January 26, 2010.\n\n2\nThe Government offered Exhibits (GXs) 1 through 9, which were received without\nobjection.  The Applicant testified on his own behalf and submitted Exhibit (AppX) A,\nwhich was received without objection.  DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (TR)\non February 2, 2010.  I granted the Applicant\u2019s two requests, one at his hearing and the\nother one subsequent to his hearing, to keep the record open until March 28, 2010, to\nsubmit additional matters.  On March 26, 2010, he submitted AppXs B through J, which\nwere received without objection. The record closed on March 29, 2010.  Based upon a\nreview of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to\nclassified information is denied.\nFindings of Fact\nIn his Answer to the SOR, the Applicant admitted the factual allegations in\nSubparagraphs 1.a. through 1.c. of the SOR, with explanations.  He denied the factual\nallegations in Subparagraphs 1.d. through 1.j. of the SOR.  He also provided additional\ninformation to support his request for eligibility for a security clearance.\nGuideline F - Financial Considerations\nAfter 20 years of service, the Applicant, a Lieutenant Commander, retired from\nthe Navy in 1992.  (TR at page 31 lines 2~25, at page 34 line 25 to page 45 line 3, and\nAppX B.)  Once retired, he initially had a significant reduction of income, until he found\npermanent employment.  (TR at page 47 lines 21~25.)  He also burdened himself with\nthe student loans of both his daughter and his son.  (TR at page 45 line 4 to page 46\nline 11.)  This contributed greatly the Applicant\u2019s current financial difficulties.\n1.a.  The Applicant is indebted to Creditor A for a credit card debt in the amount\nof about $14,377.  (TR at page 57 line 9 to page 60 line 19, and GX 9 at page 2.)  The\nApplicant averred that he would address this admitted debt; but despite having been\ngiven two months after his hearing to do so, he has submitted nothing in this regard.\n(TR at page 88 line 18 to page 89 line 6.)  I find that this debt has not been addressed;\nand as such, is still outstanding.\n1.b.  The Applicant was indebted to Creditor B for a credit card debt in the\namount of about $3,504.  (TR at page 56 line 14 to page 57 line 8.)  The Applicant\nsettled this debt for $1,807, and paid the agreed to amount in December of 2009.  (Id.)\nThis is evidenced by \u201cProof of Delivery\u201d of a cashier\u2019s check, and by a letter from the\nsuccessor creditor of this debt.  (AppX A.)\n1.c.  The Applicant was indebted to Creditor C for a credit card debt in the\namount of about $12,906.  (TR at page 62 line 3 to page 63 line 19, and at page 89 line\n7 to page 90 line 2.)  The Applicant settled this debt for $7,200, and will be making\nmonthly payments of $200 beginning in March of 2010.  (Id, and AppX C.)  This is\nevidenced by \u201cSettlement Agreement and Release\u201d from the creditor.  (AppX C.)\n\n3\n1.d.  The Applicant was indebted to Creditor D for a credit card debt in the\namount of about $15,307.  (TR at page 63 line 20 to page 66 line 1.)  The Applicant\nsettled this debt, which increased to about $29,657 including interest, for $17,800 in\nJanuary of 2007.  (Id, and Response at Encl 2.)  He avers credibly that it has \u201cbeen paid\noff.\u201d  His credibility is attested to by those who know the Applicant.  (AppXs G and H.)\nFurthermore, it does not appear on the Applicant\u2019s most recent January 2010 credit\nreport.  (GX 9.)\n1.e. and 1.g.  The Applicant filed his Federal Income Tax Returns for tax year\n2004 in January of 2008, and for tax year 2005 in August of 2009.  (TR at page 77 line\n14 to page 80 line 4, at page 81 lines 16~22 at page 83 line 23 to page 84 line 3, at\npage 85 line 20~23, at page 90 lines 3~23, and Response at Encls 3 and 7.)  In March\nof 2010 the Applicant retained counsel to address the $27,855 owed in back taxes for\ntax year 2004.  (AppX E.)  This counsel is \u201cin the initial process of gathering the\nnecessary financial data and Income source information.  (Id.)\n1.f., and 1.h.~1.j.  The Applicant filed his state income tax return for tax year\n2004 in January of 2008, and for tax years 2005 and 2006 in August of 2009.  (TR at\npage 81 lines 16~22 at page 83 line 23 to page 84 line 3, at page 90 line 24 to page 91\nline 17, and Response at Encls 3~6.)  In March of 2010 the Applicant retained counsel\nto also address the $16,059 owed in back taxes for tax years 2005 and 2006.  (AppX\nE.)\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG).  In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law.  Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process.  The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and commonsense decision.  According to\nParagraph 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables\nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d  The administrative judge must consider all\navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and\nunfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration.\nParagraph 2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for\naccess to classified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d  In\nreaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical\nand based on the evidence contained in the record.  Likewise, I have avoided drawing\ninferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\n\n4\nUnder Directive Paragraph E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to\nestablish controverted facts alleged in the SOR.  Under Directive Paragraph E3.1.15,\nthe Applicant is responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut,\nexplain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department\nCounsel. . . .\u201d  The Applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a\nfavorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence.  This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours.  The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information.  Decisions include, by necessity, consideration\nof the possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information.  Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d  See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).\nAnalysis\nGuideline F - Financial Considerations\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set\nout in Paragraph 18:\nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and\nmeet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment,\nor unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information.  An individual who is financially\noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate\nfunds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns.  Under\nSubparagraph 19(a), an \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially\ndisqualifying.  Similarly under Subparagraph 19(c), \u201ca history of not meeting financial\nobligations@ may raise security concerns.  The Applicant has significant past due debts\nand back taxes that are still outstanding.  Subparagraph 19(g) is also applicable, as\nthere was a \u201cfailure to file annual Federal, state . . . income tax returns as required . . .\u201d\nThe Mitigating Condition found in Subparagraph 20(b) is arguably applicable\nwhere \u201cthe conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the\n\n5\nperson\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, . . .), and the individual acted responsibly\nunder the circumstances.@  With his retirement from the Navy, the Applicant\u2019s income\nwas substantially reduced; and as such, he could not keep paying on his credit card and\nhis children\u2019s college loan payments.  However, Subparagraph 20(d) under the\nMitigating Conditions is not applicable, as there is not enough evidence to show \u201cthe\nindividual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve\ndebts.@  Here, the Applicant has offered nothing to show that he has addressed his\nsignificant credit card debt to creditor A, and he has only recently begun to  address his\nstate and Federal back taxes, which are substantial.\nWhole-Person Concept\nUnder the whole-person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances.  Under Paragraph 2(c), the ultimate determination of\nwhether to grant eligibility for a security clearance must be an overall commonsense\njudgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person\nconcept.\nThe Administrative Judge should also consider the nine adjudicative process\nfactors listed at AG Paragraph 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nI considered all of the evidence, including the potentially disqualifying and\nmitigating conditions surrounding this case.  Here, he has the unqualified support of\nthose with whom he works and know him in the community.  (AppXs G and H.)\nHowever, the record evidence leaves me with questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s\neligibility and suitability for a security clearance.  For all these reasons, I conclude\nApplicant has not mitigated the security concerns arising from his financial\nconsiderations.\n\n6\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a.:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraphs 1.b.~1.d.:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraphs 1.e. and 1.f.:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraphs 1.g.~1.j.:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\nRichard A. Cefola\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Howry, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n \n \nSeptember 30, 2010 \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nGOLDSTEIN, Jennifer I., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant failed to mitigate the Criminal Conduct, Financial Considerations, and \nPersonal Conduct security concerns. Eligibility for access to classified information is \ndenied.  \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn January 12, 2010, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) \nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct; Guideline F, Financial Considerations; and Guideline E, \nPersonal Conduct. The action was taken under Executive Order (EO) 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) effective for cases dated after September 1, 2006.  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on February 8, 2010, and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on June 15, 2010. DOHA \n\n \n2 \n \nissued a notice of hearing on June 21, 2010.  The hearing was scheduled for August 2, \n2010. Applicant requested a continuance, which was granted. The hearing was \nrescheduled and convened on August 17, 2010. The Government offered Exhibits (GE) \n1 through 18. All of them were admitted without objection, except GE 5 which was \nadmitted over Applicant\u2019s objection. The Government also presented GE 19, a \nMemorandum of Law, post-hearing. The Applicant offered Exhibits (AE) A through WW, \ncalled two witnesses, and testified on his own behalf. All were admitted without \nobjection, except AE B, C, D, H, I, and K, which were admitted over the Government\u2019s \nobjection. The record was left open for the receipt of additional documents. The \nGovernment offered GE 19, which was admitted. Applicant presented AE XX through \nKKK on August 13, 2010. The Government had no objection to AE XX through JJJ, and \nthey were admitted. The admissibility of AE KKK is addressed below. DOHA received \nthe transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on August 27, 2010.  \n \nProcedural Ruling \n \nThe Government objects to AE KKK, Applicant\u2019s final post-hearing exhibit. The \nGovernment\u2019s initial objection was based upon the Doctrine of Completeness, Federal \nRules of Evidence (FRE) 106, as Applicant did not present the full document. Applicant \nthen presented a copy of the 10-page pre-sentence report, with portions that were \nredacted. The Government again objected, based upon FRE 106. It should be noted \nthat the Government did not object to AE LL, which also contains portions of the same \npre-sentence report. Applicant appears to be introducing KKK to provide information on \nhis \u201cOther Criminal Conduct\u201d addressed in the pre-sentence report. This information \ndoes not appear elsewhere in the record. \n \nDoD Directive \u00b6E3.1.19 provides that the Federal Rules of Evidence shall serve \nas a Guide. However, it permits the technical rules of evidence to be relaxed to permit \nthe development of a full and complete record. The DOHA process encourages Judges \nto err on the side of admitting evidence into the record and then to consider a party\u2019s \nobjections when deciding what, if any, weight to give to that evidence.1 AE KKK is \nadmitted. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant admitted the SOR allegations \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 1.c., 1.d., 2.b., 2.c., 2.d., and \n2.e. He denied SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a., 2.f, 3.a. and 3.b. After a thorough and careful review of the \npleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of fact. \n \n \nApplicant is 47 years old. He served in the U.S. Army from 1986 through 1991. \nHe was discharged under other than honorable conditions, as set forth below. He \nreenlisted in October 1998 through October 2004. The Government presented \ndocuments that questioned the validity of the re-enlistment noting that some of the \ndocumentation was forged; however this was not alleged in the SOR. Applicant \nreceived an honorable discharge from the Army Reserve in 2004. He is divorced and \n                                                          \n1 See, ISCR Case No. 04-11571 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Feb. 8, 2007). \n \n\n \n3 \n \nhas two adult children that reside with Applicant. (GE 1; GE 5; GE 6; GE 9; GE 18; AE \nZ; AE KK; AE MM; AE VV; Tr. 162-166, 180-182, 228.) \n \n \nOn November 25, 1984, Applicant was arrested for Carrying a Firearm in a \nVehicle. He was approximately 21-years old at the time. He had been shooting at a \nrange earlier that day. After finishing target practice, he wrapped the unloaded gun up in \na towel and placed it in the glove box of his car, since he did not have a case for it. In \nhis haste to get ready for a date that evening, he forgot to remove the gun. After \ndropping his date off for the evening, he was pulled over by the police for a tail light \ninfraction. He reached in his glove box to get his registration and the handle of the gun \nwas visible to the police officer. Applicant was arrested. He was later found guilty and \nsentenced to four days in jail and one-year probation. The gun was confiscated. (GE 7; \nGE 9; Tr. 166-172.)  \n \n \nOn March 21, 1991, Applicant was charged with violation of the Uniform Code of \nMilitary Justice (UCMJ) Article 92 for Failure to Obey Lawful Order or General \nRegulation; Article 103, Captured or Abandoned Property; and Article 121, Larceny. \nWhile serving in the Army in Iraq, Applicant acquired three pistols and one submachine \ngun, captured enemy property, given to him by co-workers who were Kuwaiti nationals. \nHe was aware that it was against orders and regulations to keep these weapons. He \nretained the guns, hoping the regulations would change. They did not and when it came \ntime for Applicant to return to the U.S., he attempted to smuggle the weapons into the \nU.S. in a sniper rifle case that was in the armory. He planned to retrieve the guns from \nthe armory when he returned back to the U.S. He was smuggling the guns for both \npersonal use and for possible resale. He included a personally owned weapon in the \nrifle case, which was also prohibited by regulation. He hid the weapons in the rifle case, \nafter signing a document acknowledging that he was aware of the regulations \nprohibiting these actions. Applicant acknowledged that he made a poor decision in this \ninstance. He blames his bad judgment on the death of his father and the birth of his son, \ntwo events he was absent for, due to his service in Iraq. As a result of his actions, \nApplicant was administratively separated in lieu of court-martial and received an other \nthan honorable discharge. (GE 2; GE 5; AE N; AE O; Tr. 172-180, 281-288.) \n \n \nOn July 2, 1996, Applicant was charged with Failure to Appear and Contempt of \nCourt. Applicant claims the charge was resolved when he paid an $81 fine. Applicant \nentered a diversion program for twelve months, without entering a plea to these \ncharges. The case was dismissed on June 17, 1997 when the diversion program was \nterminated. (GE 7; AE P; AE KKK; Tr. 185-188.) \n \n \nOn December 11, 2003, Applicant was charged with Impersonating Authorized \nU.S. Military Personnel, Making False Writings, and Theft of Government Property. On \nMay 9, 2005, he pled guilty to 18 USC \u00a7 701, Unlawful Manufacture or Possession of \nOfficial Insignia. He was found guilty and sentenced to a fine of $5,000 and two-years \nprobation. In mid-to-late 1997 through his re-enlistment in October 1998 Applicant \nbecame associated with a reserve unit. He wanted to obtain a waiver and re-enlist in the \nArmy. Prior to actually joining the unit or being granted a waiver on the bar to re-\nenlistment, he \u201cvolunteered\u201d his services with the unit and became the individual \n\n \n4 \n \nresponsible for obtaining supplies for training purposes. This volunteer service is not \npermitted by law. As a volunteer, he created a document, which authorized him to \nobtain Defense Reutilization and Marketing Office (DRMO) items for the unit, by copying \na pre-existing supply memorandum on Department of Defense letterhead and adding \nhis name. Applicant claims he created this memo at the direction of his commander. I \ndid not find his testimony credible. He denies that he impersonated U.S. Military \nPersonnel and used the supply memorandum to obtain military items that were then \nleased privately to the motion picture industry, as well as the other criminal allegations \nmade against him by the Federal Bureau of Investigations. (GE 3; GE 4; GE 5; GE 6; \nGE 9; GE 18; AE Q; AE R; AE S; AE LL; AE MM; AE NN; AE OO; AE PP; AE QQ; AE \nRR; AE WW; Tr. 79, 91, 109, 182-224, 228.)  \n \n \nA tax lien was filed against Applicant in November 2009 in the amount of $77. \nApplicant provided copies of two checks that he claimed satisfied this tax obligation. \nNeither of the checks had been canceled. Applicant provided copies of releases on \nseveral tax liens, none of the releases correspond to this lien. (GE 14; AE U; AE JJJ; Tr. \n138-139, 230-238.) \n \n \nTwo tax liens (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.b and 2.c) were filed against Applicant by a county tax \ncollector in December 2004 and November 2005, for approximately $104 and $100, \nrespectively. Applicant explained that these liens were for property taxes on jet skis that \nhe had sold prior to the liens. The individuals who purchased the jet skis failed to \nregister the transfer of the titles. Applicant produced documentation showing these liens \nwere released and he is no longer liable for these amounts. (GE 8; GE 10; GE 11; GE \n12; GE 15; GE 17; AE JJJ; Tr. 230-238.) \n \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.d and 2.f., allege the same collection account owed to a collections \nagent for a bank, in the approximate amount of $260. Applicant incurred this debt when \nhe failed to close his banking account after switching to another bank. Applicant claims \nhe has disputed this debt, but failed to provide documentation of the dispute. (GE 10; \nGE 11; GE 12; GE 15; GE 17; Tr. 229, 260.) \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 2.e. is a credit card debt in the approximate amount of $953. In August \n2010, Applicant paid this creditor $800 to settle the account. He provided a copy of the \ncanceled check as proof of payment. (GE 8; GE 15; GE 17; AE T; Tr. 136-137.) \n \n \nApplicant also presented documentation to show that he settled an additional \ndebt, not listed on the SOR. He claims that he has no other past due accounts and \npresented an August 2010 credit report to substantiate this claim. He blames his \nfinancial delinquencies on a trade union strike that took place a few years ago. \nApplicant failed to introduce evidence, other than his testimony, to support his claim of a \nstrike. Due to the nature of Applicant\u2019s current profession, he works for short periods of \ntime on many different projects. Thus, he does not have a stable income. He presented \npay stubs from several different employers to substantiate this claim. (AE T; AE V; AE \nW; AE X; AE HHH; Tr. 229.) \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \nApplicant executed his e-QIP on August 6, 2008. The e-QIP asked: \u201cSection 27: \nYour Financial Record c. In the last 7 years, have you had a lien placed against your \nproperty for failing to pay taxes or other debts?\u201d Applicant indicated \u201cNo.\u201d In doing so, \nhe failed to disclose the two tax liens filed against him in December 2004 and \nNovember 2005, for approximately $104 and $100, respectively, as set out in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n2.b. and 2.c. Applicant contends that his omission was not deliberate. He claimed at the \nhearing that he was not aware of the liens. However, when he was asked about the \nliens during his October 2008 subject interview, Applicant acknowledged that he was \naware of seven small tax liens around the $100 range, but did not list them on his e-QIP \ndue to oversight. (GE 6; GE 9; GE 12; Tr. 242-260.) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s good character was attested to by his two witnesses and through 13 \nletters from personal and professional colleagues. He has been active in the Boy Scout \n\u201cexploring program\u201d for a number of years. He has also participated in other volunteer \nactivities. He presented evaluation reports to show he met the Army\u2019s standards and \nvalues, while in the Army. His waiver packet for his re-enlistment in the Army also \ncontained numerous letters of recommendation, letters of commendation, and award \ncertificates. (AE A; AE B; AE C; AE D; AE E; AE F; AE G; AE H; AE I; AE J; AE K; AE L; \nAE M; AE Y; AE Z; AE XX; AE YY; AE ZZ; AE AAA; AE BBB; AE CCC; AE DDD; AE \nEEE; AE FFF; AE GGG; Tr. 57-67, 74-75, 78-108, 223-224.)  \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \n\n \n6 \n \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Criminal Conduct is set out in \nAG \u00b6 30: \n \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability \nor willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 31 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following are potentially applicable:  \n \n(a) a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses; and \n \n(c) allegation or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the \nperson was formally charged, formally prosecuted or convicted. \n \nApplicant has a long criminal history from 1984, through his most recent \nconviction in 2005. Over this 21-year time span, he had four criminal incidents, three of \nwhich were serious offenses. The above disqualifying conditions have been established.  \n \nTwo Criminal Conduct mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 32 are potentially \napplicable:  \n \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and \n\n \n7 \n \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and \n \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited \nto the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or \nrestitution, job training or higher education, good employment record, or \nconstructive community involvement. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s criminal conduct involves extremely poor judgment. While a number \nof years have passed since his last criminal act and subsequent conviction, the passing \nof time does not mitigate his lack of judgment. He was a mature adult at the time of his \nlast criminal act. His 21-year history of criminal conduct reflects a disregard for following \nrules and regulations and not only cast doubt on his judgment, but also his reliability and \ntrustworthiness. Based on his long history of criminal conduct I cannot find that future \ncriminal conduct is unlikely to recur. AG \u00b6 32(a) does not apply. \n \n \nApplicant presented numerous letters of recommendation, work performance \nappraisals, certificates, evidence of volunteer work, and other character evidence. \nHowever, these alone are not enough to mitigate his criminal activity. Applicant \ndisplayed little remorse for his most recent criminal actions. He did not recognize that \nany of his actions were wrong. I find at this juncture there is insufficient evidence to \nshow successful rehabilitation. AG \u00b6 32(d) does not apply. \n \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern for Financial Considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18, as \nfollows:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concern under \nAG \u00b6 19. Two are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \n \nApplicant has demonstrated an unwillingness or inability to satisfy his debts. He \nhas failed to closely monitor his finances since 2004. AG \u00b6 19(a) and 19(c) are \ndisqualifying. \n \n \n\n \n8 \n \n \nFive Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control;  \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \nApplicant has satisfied three of his debts, but two debts remain unpaid. Applicant \nbelieves he paid the remaining tax obligation (SOR \u00b6 2.a.) and is disputing the bank \ncollection (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.d and 2.f.). However, he has not provided any documentation that \nsupports his claims. The lack of documentation indicates that the financial problems are \nrecent and ongoing. AG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply. \n \n \nApplicant blames his recent financial delinquencies on a union strike. However, \nhe failed to show that he has been acting responsibly under the circumstances with \nrespect to his remaining debts. While an applicant is not required to be debt free, nor is \nhe required to develop a plan for paying all debts immediately or simultaneously, \u201can \napplicant must act responsibly given his circumstances and develop a reasonable plan \nfor repayment, accompanied by \u2018concomitant conduct\u2019.\u201d2 He did not demonstrate any \ntype of plan for handling his remaining debts. AG \u00b6 20(b) does not apply. \n \n \nApplicant failed to present evidence that he had received any financial \ncounseling. Further, he failed to show that his financial problems are under control. AG \n\u00b6 20(c) does not apply. \n \n \nApplicant has satisfied three of five of his delinquent debts. He claims that SOR \u00b6 \n2.a. is satisfied, but failed to present documentation to support his claim. There is no \n                                                          \n2 ISCR Case No. 08-06567 at 3 (App. Bd. October 29, 2009.) \n\n \n9 \n \nevidence he has initiated a good-faith effort to repay his remaining overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts with respect to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a and 2.d. (duplicated in SOR \u00b6 2.f.). \nAG \u00b6 20(d) is only partially applicable. \n \n \nApplicant contests that he owes any amount to the creditor listed in SOR \u00b6 2.d. \n(duplicated in 2.f.). However, he admits that he incurred the debt when he failed to close \na bank account. He failed to produce any documentation of the steps that he has taken \nto dispute this debt or other documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute. \nAG \u00b6 20(e) does not apply. \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in \nAG \u00b6 15: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying conditions are potentially applicable: \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \naward benefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; and \n \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress, such as \n(1) engaging in activities which, if known, may affect the person\u2019s \npersonal, professional, or community standing. \n \n \nI find Applicant was not credible when he testified he was unaware of the tax \nliens when he completed his e-QIP. When he was asked about the liens during his \nOctober 2008 subject interview, Applicant acknowledged that he was aware of seven \nsmall tax liens around the $100 range. I find he deliberately omitted or concealed the \nliens from his e-QIP.  \n \n \nApplicant is clearly embarrassed by his criminal history and he is vulnerable to \nexploitation, manipulation, or duress. His conduct from 1984 through 1998 is sufficient \nto raise concerns under AG \u00b6 16(e). \n \n\n \n10 \n \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following \nare potentially applicable:  \n \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was \ncaused or significantly contributed to or by improper or inadequate advice \nof authorized personnel or legal counsel advising or instructing the \nindividual specifically concerning the security clearance process. Upon \nbeing made aware of the requirement to cooperate or provide the \ninformation, the individual cooperated fully and truthfully: \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, \nor other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur; and \n \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s failure to list his tax liens on his e-QIP was deliberate. He did not \ncorrect his omission prior to being confronted in the subject interview about the liens. \nFurther, there is no evidence of improper or inadequate advice with respect to this \nomission. Applicant\u2019s omission casts doubt on his personal judgment.  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s criminal conduct raises questions about his trustworthiness, judgment \nand reliability. He has demonstrated that even when given a second chance, when he \nwas \u201cvolunteering\u201d for the reserve unit, he willingly broke rules and failed to abide by the \nregulations. Applicant failed to acknowledge his behavior and demonstrate a change in \nhis behavior. He failed to show remorse for his most recent criminal conduct. Applicant \nhas a long history of poor judgment and making poor choices and has failed to \ndemonstrate positive steps to convince me that future inappropriate behavior is unlikely \nto recur. I find none of the above mitigating conditions apply. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n\n \n11 \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guidelines J, F, and E in my whole-person analysis. \n \nI have considered Applicant\u2019s character, as attested to by his two witnesses and \nthrough the 13 letters from personal and professional colleagues; his volunteer work \nwith the Boy Scouts and other organizations; his evaluation reports; letters of \ncommendation; and award certificates. However, the serious nature of his criminal \nconduct, especially his 1991 UCMJ violations and his 2005 conviction, lead me to \nconclude he does not demonstrate the good judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness \nrequired of one who has access to classified information. He was a mature adult when \nhe committed these offenses. Applicant has failed to demonstrate genuine rehabilitation \nor remorse for his actions.  \n \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has not mitigated the Criminal Conduct, Financial Considerations, \nand Personal Conduct security concerns. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline J:  \n \nAGAINSTAPPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a.:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c.:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.d.:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n\n \n12 \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a.:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.b:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.c.:  \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.d.:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.e.:  \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.f.:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nParagraph 3, Guideline E:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 3.a.:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 3.b:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n________________________ \nJennifer I. Goldstein \nAdministrative Judge \n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact After a thorough review of the pleadings, transcript, and exhibits, I make the following essential findings of fact. Applicant admitted 49 of the 57 allegations in response to the SOR. Her admissions are included in my findings of fact. Applicant is 42 years old, and has been a claims associate for a defense contractor for over ten years. She was married, but separated in 2004, and divorced in 2005. She has four children, one at home working and attending college, one away at college, and two grown children working and living on their own. Her monthly pay is approximately $1,700, and her monthly expenses are about $1,600. She has little discretionary funds available each month. Her divorce decree did not provide for division of debts or property or payment of child support (Tr. 22-25, 64-68; Gov. Ex. 1, SF 85P, dated December 1, 2008). Credit reports (Gov. Ex. 5, dated December 4, 2009; Gov. Ex. 6, dated June 9, 2009; Gov. Ex. 7, dated December 3, 2008; and Gov. Ex. 8, dated June 20, 2003) listed 57 delinquent debts totaling approximately $56,000 owed by Applicant. The debts include approximately 25 medical accounts, 14 credit card or loan accounts, and 18 other accounts for department stores, utilities, telephone service, television service, and repossessions. It is recognized that some of the debts listed in the SOR are duplicates, and other were unknown by Applicant. The duplicates and the unknown accounts affect the total amount of debt owed.

On August 31, \n2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued Applicant a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing trustworthiness concerns for financial \nconsiderations under Guideline F. The action was taken under Department of Defense \nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); Department of Defense (DoD) Regulation \n5200.2-R, Personnel Security Program, dated January 1987, as amended (Regulation); \nand the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on \nDecember 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued \nafter September 1, 2006. Applicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on September 3, \n2009. \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on September 22, 2009. She admitted 49 \nand denied 8 of the 57 allegations under Guideline F. She requested a hearing before \nan administrative judge. Department Counsel was prepared to proceed on October 28, \n2009, and the case was assigned to me on November 17, 2009. DOHA issued a Notice \nof Hearing on November 20, 2009, for a hearing on December 9, 2009. Applicant \nreceived the Notice of Hearing on November 30, 2009. I convened the hearing as \n1 \n \nFebruary 25, 2010\n\n2 \n \nscheduled. The government offered nine exhibits, marked Government Exhibits (Gov. \nEx.) 1 through 9, which were admitted without objection. Applicant submitted four \nexhibits, marked Applicant Exhibits (App. Ex.) A through D, which were admitted without \nobjection. Applicant testified on her behalf. I left the record open for Applicant to submit \nadditional documents. Applicant timely submitted three additional documents, marked \nApp. Ex. E through G, which were received without objection (Gov. Ex. 10. \nMemorandum, dated December 31, 2009). DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) of the \nhearing on December 22, 2009. Based on a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, \nand testimony, eligibility for access to sensitive information is denied. \n \nProcedural Issues \n \n \nApplicant received the Notice of Hearing on November 30, 2009, nine days \nbefore the hearing. Applicant is entitled to 15 days advance notice of the hearing \n(Directive \u00b6 E3.1.8). Applicant discussed with Department Counsel the hearing date of \nDecember 9, 2009, before the Notice of Hearing was mailed, so actual notice was given \nmore than 15 days before the hearing. At the hearing, Applicant waived the 15 days \nnotice requirement (Tr. 5-6). \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nAfter a thorough review of the pleadings, transcript, and exhibits, I make the \nfollowing essential findings of fact. Applicant admitted 49 of the 57 allegations in \nresponse to the SOR. Her admissions are included in my findings of fact.  \n \n \nApplicant is 42 years old, and has been a claims associate for a defense \ncontractor for over ten years. She was married, but separated in 2004, and divorced in \n2005. She has four children, one at home working and attending college, one away at \ncollege, and two grown children working and living on their own. Her monthly pay is \napproximately $1,700, and her monthly expenses are about $1,600. She has little \ndiscretionary funds available each month. Her divorce decree did not provide for \ndivision of debts or property or payment of child support (Tr. 22-25, 64-68; Gov. Ex. 1, \nSF 85P, dated December 1, 2008). \n \n \nCredit reports (Gov. Ex. 5, dated December 4, 2009; Gov. Ex. 6, dated June 9, \n2009; Gov. Ex. 7, dated December 3, 2008; and Gov. Ex. 8, dated June 20, 2003) listed \n57 delinquent debts totaling approximately $56,000 owed by Applicant. The debts \ninclude approximately 25 medical accounts, 14 credit card or loan accounts, and 18 \nother accounts for department stores, utilities, telephone service, television service, and \nrepossessions. It is recognized that some of the debts listed in the SOR are duplicates, \nand other were unknown by Applicant. The duplicates and the unknown accounts affect \nthe total amount of debt owed. \n \n \nWhen Applicant was married, she and her husband both worked and the family \nhad two incomes. They used credit cards for purchases but were just barely able to \nmeet the minimum payments and did accumulate delinquent debts while married. When \nApplicant separated from her husband, she could not pay all of the delinquent debts. In \n\n3 \n \naddition, she and her son became sick and she had medical debts not covered by her \nmedical insurance. The credit card companies demanded full payment of the debts \nrather than the small monthly payments that Applicant offered the creditors. Even if she \nwas able to establish payment plans, she could not continue to make the payments. \nShe sought financial counseling and is now working with a debt management firm. The \ndebt management firm is attempting to set up payment plans with some of the creditors. \nApplicant contacted two of the creditors for her medical debts who advised Applicant to \nstart paying the smaller debts first and then work up to the larger debts (Tr. 25-28). \n \n \nThe delinquent debt at SOR 1.a is a telephone debt for phone service used by \nApplicant, her husband, and her son. She stopped making payments on this debt in \nNovember 2005. Applicant contacted the creditor but no agreement was reached. This \ndebt is not paid (Tr. 28-32). \n \n \nApplicant has no knowledge of the debt for $666 at SOR 1.b. She has not paid \nthe debt, nor has she made any attempt to contact the creditor (Tr. 31-33). \n \n \nThe delinquent debts at SOR 1.c for $81, and SOR 1.d for $65 are medical debts \nto the same creditor. The debts have been bundled together by the creditor, Applicant \nagreed to pay $25 per month towards the debts. She has made one payment. Applicant \ndid not provide a receipt for the one payment (Tr. 33-34, 40-41).  \n \n \nThe delinquent debt at SOR 1.e is for television cable service. Applicant has not \ninquired about this debt or made any payment on the debt (Tr. 35).  \n \n \nThe delinquent debts at SOR 1.f and SOR 1.g are also medical debts. Applicant \nbelieves they are either to a medical laboratory or to a hospital but she is not sure of the \ncreditor. She has not inquired about the debts nor made any payments on the debts (Tr. \n41-43). \n \n \nThe delinquent debts at SOR 1.h for $437 and SOR 1.i for $1,837 are credit card \ndebts. The delinquent debt at SOR 1.k for $1,285 is for a loan. The delinquent debt at \nSOR 1.r for $1,512, also listed at SOR 1.uu, is to a department store for credit card \npurchases. The delinquent debt at SOR 1.bb for $856 is for a loan. The delinquent \ndebts at SOR 1.mm, also listed at SOR 1.vv, for $3,762, and SOR 1.nn for $2,972 are \nfor different credit cards in collection for the same creditor. The delinquent debt at SOR \n1.pp for $1,408 is for a department store account. The delinquent debts at SOR 1.qq for \n$1,516, SOR 1.rr for $856, and SOR 1.ss for $692 are for credit card debts. These \ndebts are included in Applicant's debt management plan. Applicant made an initial \npayment to the debt management firm of $100 shortly before the hearing. She is to pay \n$215 monthly under the plan. Applicant did not provide documentation concerning any \nmonthly payments she made to the debt management company or any payments made \nto creditors according to this plan (Tr. 35-37, 57-61; App. Ex. D and G, Agreement, \nundated and unsigned; App. Ex. F, Debt schedule, dated, December 27, 2009).  \n \n \nThe delinquent debt at SOR 1.j, also listed at SOR 1.l, for $546 is to a mail order \ncompany. Applicant has not contacted the creditor or paid this debt (Tr. 45-46). \n\n4 \n \n \nThe delinquent debts at SOR 1.m to SOR 1.aa (except for SOR 1.r) and SOR \n1.ww, SOR 1.xx, and SOR 1.yy are for medical debts in collection for a hospital ranging \nfrom $763 to $15 and total $4,428. Applicant's arrangement with the creditor was to pay \nthe smaller debts first before making payments on the larger debts. The first payment \nwas due shortly after the hearing. Applicant stated she made the payments but did not \nprovide documentation of the payments (Tr. 46-50; App. Ex. E, Applicant's notes, dated \nDecember 28, 2009).  \n \n \nThe delinquent debts at SOR 1.cc for $120 and SOR 1.dd for $1,016 are for \ntelephone bills. At the hearing, Applicant stated she has not contacted the creditors or \npaid the debts. In her post-trial submission, Applicant stated that she made \narrangements to pay the debt at SOR 1.cc in January 2010. Applicant has not \npresented any documentation to establish any payments on either debt (Tr. 51; App. Ex. \nE, Applicant's notes, dated December 28, 2009). \n \n \nThe delinquent debt at SOR 1.ee for $457 is for a prepaid cell phone. Applicant \ndisputed this debt since it was for a prepaid phone. She contacted the phone company \nwho adviser her that under her contract she was required to pay charges on the phone. \nApplicant denied the debt and will not pay it (Tr. 51-52). \n \n \nThe delinquent debt at SOR 1.ff for $245 is for an unknown debt. Applicant \nbelieves it may be for a medical debt but is not sure. Applicant has not contacted any \ncreditor or made any payment on this debt (Tr. 52-54). \n \n \nThe delinquent debt at SOR 1.gg for $215 is for a returned check presented to \npay a telephone debt. The delinquent debt at SOR 1.hh for $494 is for an account with a \ncredit union. Applicant has not contacted the creditors or made any payments on these \ndebts (Tr. 54).  \n \n \nThe delinquent debt at SOR 1.ii for $365 is for a loan. Applicant contacted the \ncreditor prior to the hearing and agreed to start monthly payments of $35. No payments \nhave been made on this account (Tr. 54-55).  \n \n \nThe delinquent debt at SOR 1.jj for $1,426 is for a loan from a finance company. \nApplicant has not taken any recent action to contact the creditor. She has not made any \nagreement to pay the loan or made any payment on the loan (Tr. 55-56).  \n \n \nThe delinquent debt at SOR 1.kk is also for a loan from a finance company. \nApplicant stated the loan was paid. She contacted the creditor and was informed the \nloan was paid. A computer document from the creditor shows the balance of the loan is \nzero with payoff in March 2005 (Tr. 56-57; App. Ex. B, e-mail screen, undated). \n \n \nThe delinquent debt at SOR 1.ll, also listed at SOR 1.tt, was for a car \nrepossessed when Applicant was married. She has not taken any action to repay the \nrepossession debt (Tr. 57). \n \n\n5 \n \n \nThe delinquent debt at SOR 1.oo for $1,582 is mostly for fees and charges on an \noverdraft of a checking account. Applicant was offered a settlement agreement from the \ncreditor but could not afford to make the payments (Tr. 58). \n \n \nThe delinquent debt at SOR 1.zz for $260 is for television service. Applicant \nacknowledges this debt and tried to make contact with the creditor and collection \nagency but was unsuccessful. She has not made any payment on this debt (Tr. 61-62). \n \n \nThe delinquent debts at SOR 1.aaa for $140 and SOR 1.bbb for $101 are for \ninsurance from two different companies Applicant had when she was married. She has \nnot paid these debts (Tr. 62). \n \n \nThe delinquent debts at SOR 1.ccc for $38, SOR 1.ddd for $35, and SOR 1.eee \nfor $15, are medical debts to the same creditor. She has agreed to make payments to \nthe creditor starting in December 2009 (Tr. 44-45; App. Ex. A, Note, dated December 8, \n2009; App. Ex. E, Statement, dated December 28, 2009). \n \nPolicies \n \nPositions designated as ADP I and ADP II are classified as \u201csensitive positions.\u201d \nThe standard that must be met for assignment to sensitive duties is that, based on all \navailable information, the person\u2019s loyalty, reliability, and trustworthiness are such that \n\"assigning the person to sensitive duties is clearly consistent with the interests of \nnational security.\u201d Trustworthiness adjudications will apply to cases forwarded to DOHA \nby the Defense Security Service and Office of Personnel Management (See, The \nDeputy Under Secretary of Defense (Counterintelligence and Security) Memorandum, \ndated November 19, 2004). Department of Defense contractor personnel are afforded \nthe right to the procedures contained in the Directive before any final unfavorable \naccess determination may be made. (See Regulation \u00b6 C8.2.1.)   \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a public trust or a sensitive position, \nthe administrative judge must consider the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the \nAG. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire process is a \nconscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d \nThe administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the \nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision (AG \u00b6 2(c)). \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \n[sensitive] information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \n\n6 \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion for obtaining a favorable trustworthiness decision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nsensitive information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard sensitive \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of sensitive information. \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by \nrules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual=s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and ability to protect sensitive information. An individual who is \nfinancially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds \n(AG \u00b6 18). Similarly, an individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or careless in their obligation to protect sensitive \ninformation. Behaving responsibly or irresponsibly in one aspect of life provides an \nindication of how a person may behave in other aspects of life. \n \n \nA person\u2019s relationship with her creditors is a private matter until evidence is \nuncovered demonstrating an inability or unwillingness to repay debts under agreed \nterms. Absent evidence of strong extenuating or mitigating circumstances, an applicant \nwith a history of serious or recurring financial difficulties is in a situation of risk \ninconsistent with the holding of a public trust position. An applicant is not required to be \ndebt-free, but is required to manage her finances in such a way as to meet her financial \nobligations. Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts, as established by credit reports and \nApplicant\u2019s statements and testimony, are a trustworthiness concern raising Financial \nConsideration Disqualifying Conditions (FC DC) \u00b619(a) (inability or unwillingness to \nsatisfy debts), and FC DC \u00b6 19(c) (a history of not meeting financial obligations). \nApplicant has 54 delinquent debts consisting of medical bills, credit card debt, telephone \nand television service bills, car repossession, and loans that have been delinquent for \nsome time. Some of the debts originated when Applicant was married and she and her \nhusband used credit cads and loans for purchases. These debts indicate a history of not \nmeeting financial obligations, as well as an inability or unwillingness to satisfy her debts. \n \n \nI considered Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions (FC MC) \u00b6 20(a) (the \nbehavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such \n\n7 \n \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment), and FC MC \u00b6 20(b) (the \nconditions that resulted in the financial problems were largely beyond the person\u2019s \ncontrol (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical \nemergency, or a death, divorce, or separation) and the individual acted responsibly \nunder the circumstances). These mitigating conditions do not apply. The debts became \ndelinquent as early as 2000, are still unpaid, and are thus current debt. Applicant has \npaid in full only one of the debts. Applicant has not contacted many of the creditors \nholding the delinquent debts. She has an agreement with a debt management firm to \nassist her in paying her debt but the agreement is only recent and she has not made \nany monthly payments under this plan beyond her initial $100 payment. Her ability to \npay her debts on her present income is minimal. While she is current with her present \nbills, the likelihood of continued financial problems is great.  \n \n \nApplicant incurred the debts when she and her husband had two incomes and \nused credit cards and loans to enhance their life style. During their marriage, they had \ntrouble meeting their financial obligations. After her divorce, Applicant could not meet \nher financial obligations. She also incurred medical debts for her and her son that she \ncould not pay. She has made only minimal payments or inquiries concerning the debts \nsince then. Many of the medical debts are for small amounts and could be resolved with \nsmall payments. She has been gainfully employed for over ten years so she could have \nmade some payments on some debts. Her divorce may have hindered her to some \nextent in making payments, but she does have the ability within her control to make \npayments on her debts. She has not inquired about the debts or made payments, so \nshe has not acted responsibly. There is a strong indication her financial problems are \nlikely to recur because she has only minimal funds to meet her present financial \nobligations and pay her past-due debts. The debts cast doubt on her reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and good judgment.  \n \n \nI have considered FC MC \u00b6 20(c) (the person has received or is receiving \ncounseling for the problem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control). This mitigating condition partially applies. Applicant \nreceived financial counseling from the debt management company starting in November \n2008. However, this was long after she knew her finances were of security concern.   \n \nI considered FC MC \u00b6 20(d) (the individual has initiated a good-faith effort to \nrepay the overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts). For FC MC \u00b6 20(d) to apply, \nthere must be an \u201cability\u201d to repay the debts, the \u201cdesire\u201d to repay, and \u201cevidence\u201d of a \ngood-faith effort to repay. A systematic method of handling debts is needed. Applicant \nmust establish a \"meaningful track record\" of debt payment. A \"meaningful track record\" \nof debt payment can be established by evidence of actual debt payments. An applicant \nis not required to establish that she paid off each and every debt listed. The entirety of \nan applicant\u2019s financial situation and her actions can reasonably be considered in \nevaluating the extent to which that applicant\u2019s plan for the reduction of her outstanding \nindebtedness is credible and realistic. Available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be considered in reaching a \ndetermination. All that is required is that an applicant demonstrates that she has \n\n8 \n \nestablished a plan to resolve her financial problems and has taken significant actions to \nimplement that plan.   \n \nApplicant has not paid and is not making payments on many of her past due \nfinancial obligations. She has not even contacted most of the creditors to verify her \ndebts. She has made some minimal payments on some debts. She has entered a debt \nmanagement plan to assist her in paying some of her largest debts. But that plan was \nonly made recently and she has not established that she made any monthly payments \nto the debt management company under the plan beyond her initial $100 payment. \nApplicant's lack of action to pay her debts is significant and constitutes credible \ninformation to show that she has not acted reasonably under the circumstances. \nApplicant has not presented sufficient information to mitigate security concerns for \nfinancial considerations. Her finances establish a public trust concern.   \n \nI considered FC MC AG \u00b6 20(e) (the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute \nthe legitimacy of the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumentation to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \ntaken to resolve the issue). Applicant disputes the telephone service bill at SOR 1.ee \nsince she claims it was a prepaid service. She did not present information to establish \nthe charge was inappropriate or that she disputed it with the creditor. Applicant has not \npresented a reasonable basis for her dispute with the telephone debt.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a public trust position by considering the totality of the \napplicant\u2019s conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider \nthe nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a public \ntrust position must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        \n \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I considered that Applicant has \nworked for her employer for over ten years and is considered a good employee. I \nconsidered that she and her son had medical issues that required medical care, and \ngenerated some medical debts. \n\n9 \n \n \nApplicant must establish a \"meaningful track record\" of debt payment, including \nevidence of actual debt reduction through payment of debts. She is not required, as a \nmatter of law, to establish that she paid each and every debt listed in the SOR. All that \nis required is that she has a plan to resolve her financial problems and takes significant \naction to implement that plan. The entirety of her financial situation and her actions can \nreasonably be considered in evaluating the extent to which her actions to reduce her \noutstanding indebtedness are credible and realistic. Available, reliable information about \nthe person's behavior, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be \nconsidered in reaching a determination. There is no requirement that a plan provide for \npayments on all outstanding debts simultaneously. Rather, a reasonable plan and \nconcomitant conduct may provide for the payment of such debts one at a time. \n \n \nApplicant has not established a meaningful track record of payment of her \ndelinquent debts. The debts incurred are the type indicating poor self-control, lack of \njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations. Applicant has not made \npayments on most of her debts. She has a debt management plan for some of her debt, \nbut it is only a recent plan and no payments under the plan have been established by \nApplicant. She has only shown payment of the debt at SOR 1.kk. The issue is not \nsimply whether all of Applicant's debts are paid. It is whether her financial \ncircumstances raise concerns about her fitness for eligibility to hold a position of public \ntrust. Applicant has not acted reasonably and responsibly towards her finances which \nindicates she may not act reasonably and responsibly to protect sensitive information. In \nthe future, if Applicant is able to establish a meaningful track record of debt payment \nand reduction, she should be afforded the opportunity to establish eligibility for a \nposition of public trust. Applicant has not established a meaningful track record of \npaying her delinquent debts. Overall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and \ndoubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a public trust position. For all these \nreasons, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the trustworthiness concerns arising \nfrom her financial situation.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1k: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.l:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.m - 1.jj;  \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.kk:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.ll -1.ss:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.tt - 1.vv:  \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.xx - 1.eee: \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n\n10 \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a public trust \nposition.  Eligibility for access to sensitive information is denied. \n \n \n \n_________________ \nTHOMAS M. CREAN \nAdministrative Judge \n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact In her Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the factual allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, and 1.b of the SOR, with explanations. She denied the factual allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 2.a and 2.b of the SOR, with explanation. 1 Applicant, who is 33 years old, works as an administrative assistant for a Department of Defense contractor. She began working in this position in January 2005. Her duties include managing an office staff of five, and inputting work orders and related information into a federal government data base. This information relates to repair and maintenance work orders for work her employer performs under contract with the military base. The data base, the computer, and the work orders do not contain classified information. The federal government requires a clearance for her common access card (CAC) which gives her access to the unclassified data base.2 Applicant\u2019s 63-year-old parents are citizens of the United States and Panama. Her father worked for the United States Government in the Panama Canal Zone and is a retired federal employee. Her parents reside in Panama, where Applicant was born. Applicant has been a citizen of Panama since birth and a citizen of the United States since 1985.

Duffy, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Bobby Olds, Esquire\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nHENRY, Mary E., Administrative Judge:\nBased upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I grant\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nApplicant completed her Security Clearance Application (SF 86) on February 15,\n2005 and signed it on November 21, 2005. The Defense Office of Hearings and\nAppeals (DOHA) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security\nconcerns under Guidelines C and E on May 26, 2009. The action was taken under\nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February\n20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial\nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended\n(Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President\non December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs\nissued after September 1, 2006. \n \nJanuary 13, 2010\n\nW hen  SOR allegations are controverted, the government bears the burden of producing evidence sufficient\n1\nto prove controverted allegations. Directive, \u00b6 E3.1.14. \u201cThat burden has two components. First, the\ngovernment must establish by substantial evidence that the facts and events alleged in the SOR indeed took\nplace. Second, the government must establish a nexus between the existence of the established facts, and\nevents and a legitimate security concern.\u201d See ISCR Case No. 07-18525 at 4 (App. Bd. Feb. 18, 2009),\n(concurring and dissenting, in part) (citations omitted).\nGE 1; Tr. 25, 51-55, 62-65, 67.\n2\nGE 1; Tr. 13-14, 25-27, 58-59.\n3\n2\nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on June 8, 2009. She answered the\nSOR in writing on June 24, 2009, and requested a hearing before an administrative\njudge. DOHA received the request on June 29, 2009. Department Counsel was\nprepared to proceed on August 31, 2009, and I received the case assignment on\nSeptember 17, 2009. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on September 25, 2009, and I\nconvened the hearing as scheduled on October 21, 2009. The government offered three\nexhibits (GE) 1 through 3, which were admitted into evidence without objection.\nApplicant and five witnesses testified. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.)\non October 29, 2009. I held the record open until November 5, 2009, for Applicant to\nsubmit additional matters. On November 5, 2009, she submitted one exhibit, AE A,\nwhich was admitted without objection. The record closed on November 5, 2009.\nFindings of Fact\nIn her Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the factual allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a,\nand 1.b of the SOR, with explanations. She denied the factual allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 2.a and\n2.b of the SOR, with explanation.   \n1\nApplicant, who is 33 years old, works as an administrative assistant for a\nDepartment of Defense contractor. She began working in this position in January 2005.\nHer duties include managing an office staff of five, and inputting work orders and related\ninformation into a federal government data base. This information relates to repair and\nmaintenance work orders for work her employer performs under contract with the\nmilitary base. The data base, the computer, and the work orders do not contain\nclassified information. The federal government requires a clearance for her common\naccess card (CAC) which gives her access to the unclassified data base.2\nApplicant\u2019s 63-year-old parents are citizens of the United States and Panama.\nHer father worked for the United States Government in the Panama Canal Zone and is\na retired federal employee. Her parents reside in Panama, where Applicant was born.\nApplicant has been a citizen of Panama since birth and a citizen of the United States\nsince 1985. At 1996, at age 20, Applicant obtained a GS-4 summer position working for\nthe United States Government in the Panama Canal Zone. At the end of the summer,\nher manager offered her a permanent position. He testified on her behalf and described\nher as a quick learner and excellent employee.3\n\nGE 1; Tr. 31-32, 43-44.\n4\nDepartment Counsel advised Applicant that if she surrendered her Panamanian passport to her facility\n5\nsecurity officer and then requested that her passport be returned to her, the government would be notified of\nher request. If so notified, the government would initiate proceedings to revoke her clearance. Tr. 76.\nGE 3; AE A; Tr. 28-31.\n6\nGE 2; Tr. 15-17, 28, 31.\n7\n3\nApplicant met her husband, who is a United States Citizen by birth, when he was\nworking in the Panama Canal Zone for the housing division of the United States Army.\nThey married in December 1999 in Germany. Since their marriage, Applicant and her\nhusband have lived in Germany, Puerto Rico, and the United States mainland. Their\ndaughter is seven years old, and a resident in and citizen of the United States.\nApplicant\u2019s 40-year-old brother is a United States citizen, living in the United States.\nApplicant\u2019s 36-year-old sister is a United States citizen, living in the United States.4\nApplicant has a Panamanian identification card, which she believes she had from\nbirth. She also has a United States passport, which she obtained after she became a\nUnited States citizen in 1985. She is a dual citizen of both countries. Applicant used her\nUnited States passport when traveling outside the United States. She used her\nPanamanian passport to enter and exit Panama, but does not otherwise use this\npassport. At the hearing, Applicant testified that she was willing to renounce her\nPanamanian citizenship or surrender her Panamanian passport to her facility security\nofficer. I held the record open for Applicant to make a decision on her hearing\nstatement.  On November 3, 2009, Applicant surrendered her Panamanian passport to\n5\nher facility security officer.   \n6\nApplicant has voted in elections in the United States, but she has not voted in\nelections in Panama. Applicant does not own any property or hold any financial assets\nin Panama. At some undefined point in the future, she may inherit a portion of her\nparents\u2019 property in Panama. Applicant does not receive any financial benefits from the\nPanamanian government. She has not worked for the Panamanian government.\nApplicant is not involved in political organizations in Panama. She and her husband own\nproperty in the United States. Applicant\u2019s preference is to the United States.7\nWhen she completed her security clearance application, Applicant answered \u201cno\u201d\nto the following question:\n16. Foreign Countries You Have Visited\nHave you traveled outside the United States on other than\nofficial U.S. Government orders in the last 7 years? (Travel\nas a dependent or contractor must be listed.) Do not repeat\ntravel covered in modules 4, 5, and 6.\n\nGE 1; Tr. 18-20, 34-38.\n8\nGE 2; GE 3; Response to SOR.\n9\nTr. 42-68.\n10\n4\nApplicant listed the dates and times she lived in Germany and Puerto Rico when she\nanswered question 4. She listed her education in Panama when she answered question\n5. She listed her employment in Panama, Puerto Rico, and Germany when she\ncompleted question 6. Because she was not clear on how to answer question 16,\nApplicant asked for assistance when she was filling out her SF-86 application. She was\ntold to \u201cdo the best you can.\u201d She understood question 16 to mean that she was not to\nlist information previously listed. She answered \u201cno\u201d based on this belief. Applicant\ncredibly testified that she had no intent to hide information or to deceive the\ngovernment.  \n8\nThe government also alleges that Applicant falsified her answers to\ninterrogatories, dated March 18, 2009, when she did not submit a copy of her\nPanamanian passport. Applicant denied any falsification. She believed that she had\nsubmitted her current Panamanian passport. She actually submitted her expired 2007\nPanamanian passport with her March 18, 2009 answer. However, six days later, she\nsubmitted her current Panamanian passport with her interrogatory answers, dated\nMarch 24, 2009.9\nApplicant\u2019s husband, first line supervisor, government project manager, her\nemployer\u2019s project manager, and a former supervisor and good friend testified on her\nbehalf. All consider her highly trustworthy and loyal to the United States. Her supervisor\nand project managers describe her as an excellent employee.  \n10\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in\nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\n\n5\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based\non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d An\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship\ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government\nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk\nan applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified\ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation\nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline C, Foreign Preference\nUnder AG \u00b6 9 the security concern involving foreign preference arises, \u201c[W]hen\nan individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a foreign country over\nthe United States, then he or she may be prone to provide information or make\ndecisions that are harmful to the interests of the United States.\u201d\nAG \u00b6 10 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be\ndisqualifying:\n(a) exercise of any right, privilege or obligation of foreign citizenship after\nbecoming a U.S. citizen or through the foreign citizenship of a family\nmember.  This includes but is not limited to:\n(1) possession of a current foreign passport.\n\n6\nApplicant had possessed a Panamanian passport since becoming a United\nStates Citizen in 1985. She used this passport to enter and exit Panama when visiting\nher parents. The government has established a prima facie case under Guideline C.\nUnder AG \u00b6 11, Applicant may mitigate security concerns arising under Guideline\nC through one of the following means:\n(a) dual citizenship is based solely on parents' citizenship or birth in a\nforeign country;\n(b) the individual has expressed a willingness to renounce dual citizenship;\n(c) exercise of the rights, privileges, or obligations of foreign citizenship\noccurred before the individual became a U.S. citizen or when the\nindividual was a minor;\n(d) use of a foreign passport is approved by the cognizant security\nauthority.\n(e) the passport has been destroyed, surrendered to the cognizant\nsecurity authority, or otherwise invalidated; and,\n(f) the vote in a foreign election was encouraged by the United States\nGovernment. \nApplicant has expressed an intent to renounce her Panamanian citizenship, but\nhas not done so. She, however, surrendered her Panamanian passport to her facility\nsecurity officer on November 3, 2009, knowing that if she requests the passport, the\ngovernment will be notified and her clearance may be revoked. She has exercised her\nrights of United States citizenship and has shown a preference for the United States\nShe has mitigated the Foreign Preference concerns under AG \u00b6 11 (e). Guideline C is\nfound for Applicant.\nGuideline E, Personal Conduct\nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern pertaining to personal conduct:\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful\nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other\nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\nAG \u00b6 16(a) describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be\ndisqualifying:\n\nSee ISCR Case No. 03-09483 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov.17, 2004)(explaining holding in ISCR Case No. 02-23133\n11\nat 5 (App. Bd. Jun. 9, 2004)).\n7\n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from\nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or\nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment\nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance\neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities.\nFor this guideline to apply, Applicant\u2019s omission must be deliberate. The\ngovernment established that Applicant omitted material facts from her SF-86 when she\nanswered \u201cno\u201d to Question 16 about her travel outside of the United States. This\ninformation is material to the evaluation of Applicant\u2019s trustworthiness to hold a security\nclearance and to her honesty. She denies, however, that she deliberately falsified her\nanswer to this question. When a falsification allegation is controverted, the government\nhas the burden of proving it. Proof of an omission, standing alone, does not establish or\nprove an applicant\u2019s intent or state of mind when the omission occurred. An\nadministrative judge must consider the record evidence as a whole to determine\nwhether there is direct or circumstantial evidence concerning an applicant\u2019s intent or\nstate of mind at the time the omission occurred.  For DC \u00b6 16 (a) to apply, the\n11\ngovernment must establish that Applicant\u2019s omission, concealment, or falsification in her\nanswer was deliberate.\nWhen she completed her SF-86, Applicant provided information in her answers\nto questions 4, 5, and 6 about her residences, education, and employment in foreign\ncountries. She had asked for guidance with answering question 16, as she was not sure\nhow she should answer it. She was told to do her best. Because she had provided\ninformation on her foreign residences, employment and education, she followed the\nquestion instruction not to provide information already listed. \nApplicant believed that she had submitted her most recent Panamanian passport\nwith her March 18, 2009 interrogatory answers. She did not and her failure was nothing\nmore than an oversight as she submitted the correct passport six days later. Applicant\nhad no intent to hide information from the government, a fact the government conceded\nat the hearing. Guideline E is found in favor of Applicant.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of an applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the\nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\n\n8\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole person concept. The decision to grant or deny a security\nclearance requires a careful weighing of all relevant factors, both favorable and\nunfavorable. In so doing, an administrative judge must review all the evidence of record,\nnot a single item in isolation, to determine if a security concern is established and then\nwhether it is mitigated. A determination of an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security\nclearance should not be made as punishment for specific past conduct, but on a\nreasonable and careful evaluation of all the evidence of record to decide if a nexus\nexists between established facts and a legitimate security concern. \nThe evidence in support of granting a security clearance to applicant under the\nwhole person concept is more substantial than the evidence in support of denial. In\nreaching a conclusion, I considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating\nconditions in light of all the facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant\ngrew up in the Panama Canal Zone when it was still a territory under the control of the\nUnited States. Her father worked for and retired from the United States government. Her\nhusband, her daughter, her parents, and her siblings are citizens of the United States.\nHer parents live in Panama. Her closest family members, her husband and daughter,\nlive with her in the United States as do her siblings. She does not own property or have\nany financial interest in Panama. Other than holding a Panamanian passport, she has\nnot exercised any rights of her Panamanian citizenship. Rather, she has exercised her\nrights as a United States citizen. She recently surrendered her Panamanian passport to\nher facility security officer. Her loyalties and preference are to the United States, not to\nPanama. She answered the questions on the SF-86 to the best of her understanding\nand did not withhold relevant information from the government when she completed her\nSF-86 or when she answered the interrogatories sent to her. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I\nconclude Applicant mitigated the security concerns arising from her foreign preference\nand personal conduct.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline C:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\n\n9\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 1, Guideline E:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.\n                                                              \nMARY E. HENRY\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro se\n\n2\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On September 2, 2009, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant\nof the basis for that decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline E (Personal Conduct) of\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant\nrequested a hearing.  On February 4, 2010, after the hearing, Administrative Judge Joan Caton\nAnthony denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant to\nDirective \u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raises the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s adverse security\nclearance decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  Finding no error, the Board affirms\nthe Judge\u2019s adverse decision.\nThe Judge made the following relevant findings of fact:  Applicant admitted the three\nallegations of disqualifying conduct in the SOR.  Applicant admitted masturbating in various public\nlocations and stated that he had not engaged in such conduct since 2004.  Applicant also admitted\ninvolvement in two affairs while he was married to his first wife\u2013a ten-year affair with a man and\nan affair late in his first marriage to the woman he eventually married.  Applicant attributed the\naffairs to his first wife\u2019s depression and the effect it had on their physical relationship.  Applicant\nis now happily married and is involved in a faith community with his current wife.  Applicant also\nadmitted engaging in sexual relations with prostitutes.  Applicant attended a military service\nacademy and retired from the military as a colonel with 26 years of service.  Applicant has two\ngrown sons from his first marriage.  Applicant\u2019s current spouse is aware of his ten-year affair, but\nis unaware of the other behavior of security concern discussed above.  Applicant\u2019s sons are not aware\nof any of that behavior.  Applicant submitted character references and performance evaluations from\nformer military superiors and from civilian employers.  Those individuals are aware of little or none\nof the behavior.  The Judge discussed and quoted from both parties\u2019 exhibits, including Applicant\u2019s\ncharacter references and performance evaluations.\nApplicant does not allege factual error on the part of the Judge, but objects to her\ncharacterization of the evidence and her adverse conclusions.  In making his objections, Applicant\nprovides detail which was not revealed at the hearing.  The Board is not able to consider such detail,\nsince it constitutes new evidence.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.29.  Based on the record as a whole, the\nBoard finds that the Judge\u2019s findings and conclusions are based on substantial evidence or constitute\nreasonable characterization or inferences that could be drawn from the record.  Applicant has not\ndemonstrated error in this regard.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 08-06605 at 4 (App. Bd. Feb. 4, 2010).\nWith regard to the fact that Applicant has not told certain people about his past behavior, he\npoints out that the Directive does not require him to do so.  However, paragraph 16 of the\nAdjudicative Guidelines lists \u201c[c]onditions that could raise a security concern and may be\ndisqualifying[.]\u201d One of the items on the list is \u201cpersonal conduct, or concealment of information\nabout one\u2019s conduct, that creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress, such as (1)\nengaging in activities which, if known, may affect the person\u2019s personal, professional, or community\nstanding[.]\u201d  See Directive \u00b6 E2.16(e).  The Judge\u2019s conclusions regarding the lack of knowledge by\nApplicant\u2019s family and associates about Applicant\u2019s behavior are sustainable.\n\n3\nApplicant underwent a psychological evaluation and submitted a copy of the resulting report\nat the hearing.  Applicant maintains that the Judge focused only on one small portion of the report.\nThere is a rebuttable presumption that the Judge considered all the record evidence unless the Judge\nclearly states otherwise.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 07-18303 at 2 (App. Bd. Nov. 13, 2008).  It is not\nnecessary for the Judge to mention every item of evidence that she considered, but here the Judge\nactually referred to other portions of the report in her decision.  Applicant has not demonstrated error\non this point. \nApplicant also argues that the Judge should have found his conduct to be mitigated because\nhe no longer participates in such conduct and because the conduct is so remote in time.  The Judge\nconsidered  Applicant\u2019s evidence of mitigation.  However, the presence of some mitigating evidence\ndoes not alone compel the Judge to make a favorable security clearance decision.  As the trier of fact,\nthe Judge has to weigh the evidence as a whole and decide whether the favorable evidence outweighs\nthe unfavorable evidence, or vice versa.  A party\u2019s disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the\nevidence, or an ability to argue for a different interpretation of the evidence, is not sufficient to\ndemonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence or reached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 07-10454 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 12, 2008).\nIn this case, the Judge weighed the mitigating evidence offered by Applicant against the\nlength and seriousness of the disqualifying conduct.  The Judge considered the possible application\nof relevant mitigating conditions and discussed why she did not apply them in Applicant\u2019s case.  The\nJudge explained why the evidence Applicant presented in mitigation was insufficient to overcome\nthe government\u2019s security concerns.  The Board does not review a case de novo.  The favorable\nevidence cited by Applicant is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge\u2019s decision is arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 08-02653 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 25, 2009).\nGiven the record that was before her, the Judge\u2019s ultimate unfavorable clearance decision under\nGuideline E is sustainable.  \n                     \nAfter reviewing the record, the Board concludes that the Judge examined the relevant data\nand articulated a satisfactory explanation for her decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between\nthe facts found and the choice made.\u2019\u201d  Motor Vehicle Mfrs.

His eligibility for \na security clearance is denied. \n \nApplicant executed and signed an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations \nProcessing (e-QIP) on July 9, 2007. On September 2, 2009, the Defense Office of \nHearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) \ndetailing security concerns under Guideline E, Personal Conduct. The action was taken \nunder Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \n(February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the \nPresident on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for \nSORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \nFebruary 4, 2010\n\n \n2 \n \n \n \nOn September 18, 2009, Applicant answered the SOR in writing and requested a \nhearing before an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on December 1, \n2009. I convened a hearing on January 13, 2010, to consider whether it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for \nApplicant. The Government called no witnesses and introduced nine exhibits, which \nwere marked Ex. 1 through 9 and admitted to the record without objection. Applicant \ntestified on his own behalf and called no witnesses. He introduced 15 exhibits, which \nwere identified and marked as Applicant\u2019s Ex. A through Ex. O. All of Applicant\u2019s \nexhibits were admitted without objection. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) of the \nhearing on January 21, 2010. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nThe SOR contains three allegations of disqualifying conduct under AG E, \nPersonal Conduct (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. through 1.c.). SOR allegation 1.a. alleged that Applicant \nexhibited questionable judgment when he masturbated in various public locations. In his \nanswer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the allegation and stated that he had not \nengaged in such conduct since 2004. (SOR; Answer to SOR.) \n \n \nSOR allegation 1.b. alleged that Applicant exhibited questionable judgment when \nhe engaged in multiple affairs despite being married. In his answer to the SOR, \nApplicant denied the allegation as written. He admitted to engaging in two extramarital \naffairs while married to his first wife. He attributed his affairs to his wife\u2019s depression and \nits negative impact on their intimacy. He identified his affair of approximately 10 years \nwith a man as \u201cnot frequent and insignificant.\u201d He admitted a second affair with a \nwoman in 2002. He reported that in 2007 he married the woman and, with her, he was \ninvolved in a faith community. He stated that the conduct alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b. \u201cwas not \nan accurate reflection of [his] current judgment or reliability.\u201d (SOR; Answer to SOR.) \n \n \nSOR allegation 1.c. alleged that Applicant exhibited questionable judgment when \nhe engaged in sexual relations with prostitutes. Applicant admitted that he had engaged \nin sexual relations with prostitutes on two occasions in 1985 and 1989. He denied any \ncontact with prostitutes since 1989 and stated that he did not \u201cbelieve that this outdated \ninformation accurately reflects [his] current reliability or trustworthiness.\u201d Applicant\u2019s \nadmissions to the SOR allegations are admitted herein as findings of fact. (SOR; \nAnswer to SOR.)  \n \n \nApplicant is 53 years old and employed as a senior program analyst by a \ngovernment contractor. He is a graduate of one of the national service academies, \nwhere, in 1978, he received a Bachelor of Science degree in physical sciences. In 1989, \nhe received a Master of Science degree in science and systems technology. (Ex. 1; Tr. \n57-58.) \n \n \nApplicant was first granted a security clearance in about 1974, when he was a \nstudent at a national service academy. After graduation from the service academy, he \nserved on active military duty for 26 years and retired in 2004 as a colonel (O-6). He \n\n \n3 \n \n \n                                           \nheld a security clearance throughout his military service. He received an honorable \nretirement from service. (Tr. 32-33, 58.) \n \n \n  Applicant was married in 1982. He is the father of two sons. His older son was \nborn in 1984, and his younger son was born in 1989. Applicant\u2019s wife suffered from \ndepression, which was diagnosed in about 1985. Applicant\u2019s wife\u2019s illness, which \ncontinued for about 18 years, was treated with medication. As a consequence of his \nwife\u2019s depression, there were times when Applicant and his wife were not intimate, and \nhe assumed additional household and childcare duties. (Ex. 1; Tr. 88-91.)  \n \n \nIn 1985 and 1989, Applicant engaged the services of female prostitutes. In the \n1990s, he masturbated while driving on an interstate highway. In 1992, he began a \nsexual relationship with a man he met through a newspaper advertisement. The \nrelationship lasted until 2002 or 2003. In an interview with a licensed psychologist in \nOctober 2009, Applicant stated that his sexual encounters with the man were \n\u201cintermittent\u201d and occurred \u201cpossibly 10 times a year.\u201d1 He denied an emotional \nattachment with the man. He told the man he was in the U.S. military. Applicant was on \nactive duty and held a security clearance throughout the affair. He knew that his active \nduty career would be jeopardized if his command learned of the affair, and he \nconcealed it.  His wife was not aware of the relationship. (Ex. K at 2; Tr. 62, 85-87.)    \n \n \nBetween 2001 and 2003, Applicant masturbated in public shower rooms and \nsteam rooms that were provided by his government employer for the use of male \nmilitary and civilian employees. He also masturbated in public in an adult bookstore \nbetween 2001 and 2003. This behavior also occurred while he was assigned to active \nduty and held a security clearance. (Ex. K at 2; Tr. 36, 58, 65-66.)  \n \n \nIn 2002, Applicant, while serving on active duty as an officer in the Department of \nDefense, met a woman at work who was serving on active duty as an enlisted person. \nApplicant began to date the woman in May 2002. He knew his relationship with the \nwoman violated provisions of the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ) prohibiting \nadultery and fraternization. He kept the relationship hidden from his command. In \nSeptember 2002, Applicant sought a legal separation from his wife. Sometime in 2002 \nor 2003, Applicant broke off his relationship with his male lover. He told the man he had \nbecome involved with a woman, was happy, and would not see him anymore. \nApplicant\u2019s divorce from his wife became final in July 2004. He pays alimony to his first \nwife. (Ex. 1; Ex. 9; Tr. 59-63, 91-92, 104-105.)    \n \n \n Applicant and his female friend were married in May 2007. Before their \nmarriage, they joined a church and sought counseling to prepare themselves for \nmarriage. They have remained in the church and are active in the congregation\u2019s \n \n1 At his hearing, Applicant asserted that he met the man \u201cvery infrequently, a couple of times a year.\u201d He \nhad no explanation for the discrepancy between the \u201cpossibly 10 times a year\u201d reported by the \npsychologist and his estimate at his hearing of infrequent meetings of about twice a year. He \nacknowledged that he was the only person who provided the psychologist with information about the \naffair. (Tr. 85, 98-99.) \n\n \n4 \n \n \nmarriage ministry. Applicant\u2019s second wife has three young adult children. They reside \nwith their mother and Applicant. Applicant considers his second marriage to be normal \nand happy. He regrets the behavior alleged in the SOR and characterizes it as \u201cstupid.\u201d \n(Ex. 1; Tr. 41-44, 49, 68.) \n \n \nAfter retiring from active service, Applicant obtained employment as a \ngovernment contractor. In 2004, Applicant\u2019s employer recommended him for a security \nclearance. As a part of the security clearance application process, Applicant was \ninterviewed by investigators at another government agency and given a polygraph test. \nIn interviews with the investigators, Applicant provided the information alleged in the \nSOR. In December 2004, the other government agency denied Applicant\u2019s access to \nclassified information because of security concerns over his sexual behavior and \npersonal conduct.  (Ex. 8; Ex. 9; Tr. 33-35.) \n \n \nIn March 2007, Applicant accepted a job with another employer and completed \nan e-QIP. His employer sponsored him for a security clearance. In August 2007, he was \ninterviewed by an authorized investigator. In his interview, Applicant told the investigator \nthat his first wife might allege marital infidelity because he began dating his current wife \nafter he and his first wife were legally separated. Applicant also told the investigator that \nanother government agency had denied him a security clearance in 2004, after he failed \na polygraph examination. Applicant also told the investigator that he \u201cwas not made \naware of the reasons for not passing the polygraph.\u201d He did not discuss his 10-year \naffair and his masturbation behavior with the investigator. (Ex. 1; Ex. 7 at 5-6; Tr. 78-\n79.) \n \n \nIn response to DOHA interrogatories, Applicant explained that he had received \ntwo documents from the other government agency pertaining to the denial of his access \nto classified information. He stated that he had discarded both documents but had \nretrieved one of them, dated 1 September 2004, which he attached. He stated he no \nlonger had a copy of the second document, which he characterized as follows: \n \n \nAs I recall, this second document described my responses to a life-\nstyle polygraph I had taken in 2004. I believe it included details describing \nmy affair with an enlisted female soldier while I was married and an \nActive-duty officer  . . . during the time period 2002 through 2004. I believe \nthe document stated I was denied a security clearance because my \nconduct at that time demonstrated a lack of judgment. Retired and \ndivorced in 2004, I eventually married the same enlisted female soldier \n(also retired) in May 2007. \n \n(Ex. 8 at 4.)    \n \n \nThe second communication that Applicant received from the other government \nagency was dated December 8, 2004. This document was offered and received into \nevidence, without objection, by the Government. The document recites why the other \n\n \n5 \n \n \ngovernment organization disapproved Applicant for access to classified information \nbased on the following information: \n \nDuring your June 2004 security testing sessions, you advised that over the \nlast ten years you have engaged in several extra-marital affairs, to include \nsome with prostitutes. You said that one of these affairs was a 10-year \nrelationship with a male you met through a newspaper ad; you noted that \nyou kept this affair hidden because you feared, as an active duty [officer], \nthat you would lose your career should the affair become known. You also \nsaid that you have kept hidden on ongoing affair you have been engaged \nin with an active duty military female for the last two years. Because you \nare an officer and she is enlisted, the situation is considered fraternization \nand a violation of the United States [Uniform] Code of Military Justice. You \nfurther advised that you have engaged in repeated public masturbation in \nthe following venues: the open bay showers at [a government agency] \ngym with a group of men; in your vehicle while driving on the interstate; \nand, in open-door video booths in an adult bookstore. You noted that you \nengaged in this behavior despite knowing there was a risk you could get \ncaught.  \n \n(Ex. 9 at 1-2.) \n \n \nOn October 8 and October 22, 2009, Applicant voluntarily submitted to a \npsychological evaluation \u201cto determine his current intellectual and personality \nfunctioning for the purpose of maintaining the security clearance necessary for his \nemployment.\u201d During his interview with a licensed psychologist, Applicant admitted the \nbehaviors recited in the paragraph above that led the other government agency to \nconclude that he was not security worthy. (Ex. K; Ex. L.) \n \n \nOver the two days of his evaluation by the psychologist, Applicant was given 18 \npsychological and intelligence-measuring tests. The several tests revealed that \nApplicant\u2019s cognitive abilities were superior, and his intellectual quotient score of 120 \nplaced him above 91% of his peers. The tests did not reveal that Applicant \ndemonstrated sexually deviant beliefs or behaviors. In his summary and evaluation, the \nevaluating psychologist observed: \u201c[I]t is likely that when [Applicant] becomes \noverwhelmed by stress due to outside situations, his social capacities modulate, \ncreating the potential for impulsive behavior. This tendency is then compounded by a \ntendency to withdraw socially, become less expressive, and more self-protective \nthrough the use of denial and repression.\u201d  (Ex. K at 8-9.) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s fitness report for the period covering April 2001 to May 2002, was \nlaudatory. His reviewing officer commented that he was \u201can outstanding officer with \nunlimited potential,\u201d possessed \u201crock solid character and values,\u201d and had applied \u201ca \npowerful intellect and energy to the emergent and tremendously complex homeland \nsecurity challenges facing our nation.\u201d His fitness report went on to state, in pertinent \npart:  \n\n \n6 \n \n \nIn tough, demanding wartime conditions, [Applicant] demonstrated the \nmoral courage to make the tough calls and give the hard advice required \nby leaders at the highest level of government. His efforts helped our senior \nleaders make the right decisions on complex issues dealing with the role \nof the US military in defense of the homeland. [Applicant] is a trusted \nadvisor admired for his expertise, unwavering integrity, and selfless \nservice. The issues he has worked are headlines of the Washington Post \nevery day. He has delivered the highest standard of duty performance at a \ncritical time in our nation\u2019s history. He has proved himself ready for \ncommand every day this past year. Applicant is a . . . leader worthy of \nrespect, emulation, and most assuredly command of a . . . [large unit].   \n \n(Ex. C at 2-3.) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s military fitness report for the rating period of June 2003 to June 2004 \nstated that he had continued to \u201cperform in an outstanding manner.\u201d The report also \nnoted that Applicant was retiring \u201cafter a highly successful 26 years [of active military \nservice.]\u201d (Ex. D at 2-3.)  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s current manager provided a letter of character reference for the \nrecord. He recited that he had known Applicant since 1978 and had served with him in \nthe military. He stated that Applicant\u2019s personal and professional conduct was of the \nhighest quality. He praised Applicant\u2019s leadership ability, reliability, dependability, and \nsound judgment. He stated that he hired Applicant \u201cfor his intellectual firepower, ethics, \nleadership ability, and his proven track record of integrity and truthfulness.\u201d (Ex. M at 1.) \n \n \nWhen Applicant asked his current manager to write a letter of character \nreference for him, he told the manager that he had been denied a security clearance \nbecause he had been unfaithful to his first wife. (Tr. 55-56.) \n \n \nA former employer also provided a letter of character reference for Applicant. He \nstated that he had known Applicant professionally and socially for 3\u00bd years. He praised \nApplicant\u2019s logical thinking, trustworthiness, and integrity. (Ex. A at 1.) \n \n \nApplicant told the woman who became his second wife about his 10-year affair \nwith another male after he revealed it in his 2004 polygraph examination. His two sons \ndo not know about the affair. Applicant\u2019s current manager and his former business \nassociate and personal friend, who provided letters of character reference for Applicant, \ndo not know about the 10-year affair or Applicant\u2019s relationships with prostitutes.  \nLikewise, the military officers who assessed Applicant\u2019s job performance in his fitness \nreports did not know about his 10-year affair and his relationships with prostitutes. (Tr. \n64-65.) \n \n \nNeither Applicant\u2019s current wife nor the individuals who provided letters of \ncharacter reference know that he masturbated in his government employer\u2019s shower \nrooms, in his automobile, and in adult bookstores while on active military duty. The \n\n \n7 \n \n \nmilitary officers who assessed Applicant\u2019s job performance in his fitness reports did not \nknow that he masturbated in his government employer\u2019s shower rooms, in his \nautomobile, and in adult bookstores while on active duty. They did not know that \nApplicant, a married man, was having an affair with an enlisted woman in military \nservice in 2002. (Tr. 59-66.)  \n \n \nApplicant and his current wife have had marriage counseling from their pastor. \nHis two meetings with the licensed psychologist in October 2009 were primarily for \ntesting and evaluation, and he has not seen the psychologist since that time. He has \ndiscussed his infidelity in his first marriage in counseling sessions with the pastor.  \nApplicant has not had psychological counseling or therapy related to the other \nbehaviors alleged on the SOR. (Tr. 46, 68-71.)  \n \n \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the \nExecutive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security, and \nit has emphasized that \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the \nNavy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the \nauthority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine \nwhether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. \nat 527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.    \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, an   \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, the administrative judge applies these guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \n\n \n8 \n \n \non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \nPersonal Conduct \n \nAG \u00b6 15 explains why personal conduct is a security concern: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \nApplicant was a high-ranking officer who was educated at a national service \nacademy. For approximately 26 years, he held a security clearance. He carried out \nduties of significance to national security. \n \nApplicant served on active duty for 26 years, until he honorably retired in 2004. \nFrom about 1985, Applicant engaged in high risk personal conduct that, if discovered, \nlikely would have ended his active duty career. As a married man, he hired female \nprostitutes, began and carried out a sexual relationship with an enlisted woman he met \nat work, and engaged in a sexual relationship with a male that lasted for over ten years. \n\n \n9 \n \n \nAdditionally, Applicant masturbated as he drove in his automobile, in public shower \nrooms in a government facility, and in adult book stores. Applicant knew his behavior \nviolated various articles of the UCMJ, and he did not disclose his misconduct to his \ncommand.  Six years later, as a civilian, he has not disclosed most of that behavior to \nhis family, business associates, and to his current manager, who provided him with a \nletter of character reference and endorsed him for a security clearance.   \n \nApplicant\u2019s personal conduct raises security concerns under AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(b), \n16(d)(3), and 16(e)(1). AG \u00b6 16(b) reads: \u201cdeliberately providing false or misleading \ninformation concerning relevant facts to an employer, investigator, security official, \ncompetent medical authority, or other official government representative.\u201d AG \u00b6 16(d)(3) \nreads: \u201ccredible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any other \nguideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse determination, but which, \nwhen combined with all available information supports a whole-person assessment of \nquestionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to \ncomply with rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the person \nmay not properly safeguard protected information. This includes but is not limited to \nconsideration of . . .  a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations.\u201d AG \u00b6 16(e)(1), reads in \npertinent part as follows: \u201cpersonal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s \nconduct, that creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress, such as . . . \nengaging in activities which, if known, may affect the person\u2019s personal, professional, or \ncommunity standing.\u201d   \n \n \nThe disqualifying behavior alleged in the SOR occurred between 1985 and 2004. \nHowever, with the exception of his marital infidelity with the enlisted woman who \nbecame his second wife, Applicant failed to disclose the other behavior alleged in the \nSOR to his employer. His failure to disclose this information is ongoing and continues to \ncast doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. Additionally, the \nbehaviors he failed to disclose would, if they were known, affect his personal, \nprofessional, and community standing, and they create in him a vulnerability to \nexploitation, manipulation, or duress. \n \nApplicant is happily married to his second wife and he and his wife attend and \nparticipate in marriage counseling at their church. He has attempted to remedy his past \nvulnerability to marital infidelity. \n \nApplicant\u2019s intellectual and psychological functioning was evaluated by a licensed \npsychologist, but he has not sought counseling or treatment from a psychiatrist or \npsychologist for the impulsive and high-risk sexual behavior and personal conduct he \nengaged in for many years. The licensed psychologist who evaluated him concluded \nthat \u201c[I]t is likely that when [Applicant] becomes overwhelmed by stress due to outside \nsituations, his social capacities modulate, creating the potential for impulsive behavior. \nThis tendency is then compounded by a tendency to withdraw socially, become less \nexpressive, and more self-protective through the use of denial and repression.\u201d \nApplicant\u2019s inability or unwillingness to obtain sufficient counseling or to take other  \nmaterial positive steps to alleviate the stressors, circumstances, or factors that caused \n\n \n10 \n \n \nhis untrustworthy, unreliable, and inappropriate behavior raises concerns that the \nbehavior may recur and that he may continue to be vulnerable to exploitation, \nmanipulation, or duress.  \n \nI have carefully reviewed the several mitigating conditions under Guideline E. I \nconclude that AG \u00b6 17(d) applies in part to Applicant\u2019s marital counseling from his \npastor. I also conclude that no other mitigating conditions are applicable in this case.  \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.         \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is a mature adult of 53 \nyears. He is intelligent and well-educated. For nearly 20 years, however, while holding a \nsecurity clearance and while carrying out high-level security responsibilities as a senior   \nofficer, Applicant engaged in ongoing high-risk behavior that exposed him to the \npossibility of exploitation, manipulation, or duress. He violated rules when he \ndeliberately carried out the behavior and then failed to disclose his misconduct to his \ncommand. Even now, he has not disclosed fully his rule-breaking and inappropriate \nbehavior to his family, his business associates, and his current civilian government \ncontractor employer. \n \n Applicant has not sought professional psychological counseling or treatment for \nhis impulsive and high risk behavior. He has not provided sufficient evidence of \nrehabilitation, and he failed to establish that the behavior would not recur. He has not \ndisclosed his behavior to those in his personal and professional life who may have a \nneed to know about it, raising ongoing concerns about his judgment, trustworthiness, \nand reliability.    \n\n \n11 \n \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. Accordingly, I conclude, \nafter a careful review of the facts of his case, the Personal Conduct adjudicative \nguideline, and the whole person analysis, that Applicant failed to mitigate the security \nconcerns arising from his personal conduct.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline E:  \nAGAINST  APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a. through 1.c.:  Against Applicant \n \n \n \n                                    Conclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n___________________________ \nJoan Caton Anthony \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Eligibility for \naccess to classified information is granted.  \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn August 17, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued \na Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under Guideline \nF, Financial Considerations. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and \neffective within the Department of Defense (DoD) for SORs issued after September 1, \n2006.  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on September 8, 2009, and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on October 8, 2009. \nJanuary 27, 2010\n\n \n2 \n \nDOHA issued a notice of hearing on October 9, 2009, and the hearing was convened as \nscheduled on November 5, 2009. The government offered Exhibits (GE) 1 through 10, \nwhich were received without objection. Applicant testified on his own behalf and \nsubmitted Exhibits (AE) A through D, which were received without objection. I granted \nApplicant\u2019s request to keep the record open to submit additional information. Applicant \nsubmitted a series of documents, which were marked AE E through K and admitted \nwithout objection. Department Counsel\u2019s memo is marked Hearing Exhibit (HE) I. DOHA \nreceived the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on November 16, 2009.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is a 35-year-old engineer for a defense contractor. He is seeking to \nretain his security clearance. He enlisted in the United States Army in 1992. He was \ncommissioned in 1997, and served on active duty from 2001 through 2003. He was \nhonorably discharged as a first lieutenant because of a disability for which he received \nseverance pay and continues to receive disability benefits. He has worked for his \ncurrent employer since 2003. He has a bachelor\u2019s degree. He was married from 1996 \nuntil his divorce in December 2008. He has three children, ages ten, nine, and seven. \nHe has joint legal custody of the children. His ex-wife has primary residential custody. \nHe is current on his child support payments of $1,225 per month.1  \n \n \nThe SOR alleges 12 delinquent debts, with balances totaling $47,783, and first \nand second mortgages in foreclosure, with balances of $216,000 and $49,880. \nApplicant admitted owing all the debts alleged in the SOR.  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s finances were in order prior to his marital separation in January 2008. \nHe submitted a Questionnaire for Sensitive Positions (SF 86) in August 2007, which did \nnot list any delinquent debts. A credit report obtained in August 2007 did not list any \npast-due or derogatory accounts. Applicant attempted to make the separation as \namicable as possible. He remained in their home and assumed responsibility for the first \nand second mortgages. His former wife was not working at the time. He gave her their \njoint savings of about $6,000 to $7,000 to set up a new household for her and the \nchildren. He withdrew $10,000 from his 401(k) retirement plan and gave it to her for \nfurniture and other expenses. She believed she deserved half of the amount of the \ncredit limit that was available on a credit card. He took cash advances from the credit \ncard and gave the money to her. His children had medical problems that were at least \npartially related to the separation and divorce, which resulted in bills for co-payments \nand prescriptions. There were legal bills related to the divorce, which combined with the \nsudden costs of maintaining two households, placed an economic strain on his \nfinances. He could not afford his first and second mortgage payments, and his house \nwent into foreclosure. Applicant reported to his security officer in September 2008, that \nhe was $4,277 delinquent on his first mortgage and $443 delinquent on his second \nmortgage. His security officer notified the DoD via the Joint Personnel Adjudication \nSystem (JPAS).2 \n                                                          \n1 Tr. at 17, 20-25, 28-29; GE 1, 3; AE A. \n \n2 Tr. at 16-18, 26-39, 43-44; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1, 3-6; AE A. \n\n \n3 \n \n \nApplicant stopped paying his mortgages in August 2008. He contacted the \nmortgagor and attempted to negotiate a lower payment. He was told that he had to pay \nthe amounts due. He continued paying his other debts. The house was lost to \nforeclosure in the spring of 2009. His divorce attorney provided him some advice but it \nwas outside her area of expertise. He believed his only recourse was to file bankruptcy. \nApplicant stopped paying his unsecured debts in about December 2008. He decided \nthat he would save for a bankruptcy attorney, and then address all his debts in a \nChapter 13 petition. He contacted his creditors and informed them that their debts would \nbe included in a Chapter 13 bankruptcy plan. He contracted with a bankruptcy attorney \nin September 2009, and paid the attorney $4,000 for his services. Applicant plans on a \nChapter 13 \u201cwage earners\u201d plan. The bankruptcy has not yet been filed. He admitted \nthat if he lost his clearance and job that the bankruptcy might have to be filed as a \nChapter 7. He stated that he would self-report if he missed any payments to the \nbankruptcy.3  \n \n \nApplicant has not received counseling, but he has educated himself by reading \nfinancial materials and books. He will have to attend counseling at some point as part of \nthe bankruptcy process. He has adjusted to the divorce, having to pay child support, \nand living on less money. He rents an apartment that he shares with a roommate. He is \nnot accruing new delinquent debt and is living within his means.4  \n \n \nApplicant submitted a number of letters on his behalf. His job performance has \nbeen outstanding. He is praised for being honest, direct, trustworthy, forthright, \nconscientious, and reliable. His performance appraisals reflected that he has exceeded \nhis employer\u2019s expectations. His security manager certified that Applicant has not \nreceived any security violations.5  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \n                                                          \n3 Tr. at 18-21, 34-40, 43, 46-49; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 3, 4; AE C, D, K. \n \n4 Tr. at 33-34, 40-41, 45, 49-53.  \n \n5 AE E-J. \n\n \n4 \n \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to \npotential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \n\n \n5 \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. Two are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n \n(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and \n \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \n \nApplicant accumulated a number of delinquent debts and was unable or unwilling \nto pay his obligations for a period. The evidence is sufficient to raise the above \ndisqualifying conditions. \n \n \n  \nFour Financial Considerations mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control; and \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts.  \n \n \nApplicant still owes the debts alleged in the SOR. His financial issues are recent \nand ongoing. AG \u00b6 20(a) is not applicable.  \n \n \nApplicant attributed his financial problems to the costs incident to his separation \nand divorce. He gave his wife his savings and took out a loan from his 401(k) to \nestablish her in a new household with their children. The children had medical problems \nand expenses that were related to the divorce. There were legal expenses plus the \nadded costs of paying child support and maintaining separate households. These \nqualify as conditions that were outside his control. To be fully applicable, AG \u00b6 20(b) \nalso requires that the individual act responsibly under the circumstances. Applicant paid \nhis debts as best he could, but was unable to maintain the two mortgages. He reported \nto his security officer in September 2008, that he was behind on his mortgages. He \neventually lost his house to foreclosure. Applicant felt the best recourse would be to file \nChapter 13 bankruptcy, which is a legal means of addressing one\u2019s burdensome debt, \nand have the trustee and court agree on a plan to pay his debts. He informed his \ncreditors that their debts would be included in a Chapter 13 bankruptcy plan. He paid \n\n \n6 \n \nhis bankruptcy attorney, but has not yet filed with the court. There are indications that \nthe problem is being resolved. He has not received formal financial counseling. \nApplicant receives partial consideration under AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(b) and 20(c). His actions do not \nqualify as a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.6 AG \n\u00b6 20(d) is not applicable. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.       \n  \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(a) were \naddressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. I considered \nApplicant\u2019s honorable military service and his steady employment record. His finances \nwere in order prior to his marital separation in January 2008, as verified by a 2007 credit \nreport. Applicant has retained an attorney to file Chapter 13 bankruptcy. He informed his \n                                                          \n6 The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a \u201cgood-faith\u201d effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts: \n \nIn order to qualify for application of Financial Considerations Mitigating Condition 6, an \napplicant must present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue \ncreditors or some other good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant\u2019s debts. The \nDirective does not define the term \u2018good-faith.\u2019 However, the Board has indicated that the \nconcept of good-faith \u2018requires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows \nreasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.\u2019 Accordingly, \nan applicant must do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally available \noption (such as bankruptcy) in order to claim the benefit of Financial Considerations \nMitigating Condition 6.  \n \n(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2004) (quoting \nISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. Jun. 4, 2001)). \n\n \n7 \n \ncreditors that their debts would be included in his bankruptcy plan. His finances have \nstabilized, and he is not incurring new delinquent debt. He stated that he would report to \nhis security manager if he did not comply with the terms of his bankruptcy plan. That \nstatement is credible since he self-reported when he was behind on his mortgages. \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has mitigated Financial Considerations security concerns. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nFor APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.n: \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance.

Howry Esquire, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n \n \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nDAM, Shari, Administrative Judge: \n \n \nBased upon a review of the record evidence, eligibility for access to classified \ninformation is denied. \n \nOn December 29, 2008, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaires for \nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP). On January 11, 2010, the Defense Office of \nHearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) \ndetailing security concerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations). The action \nwas taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, \nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive), and the Adjudicative Guidelines effective within the Department of \nDefense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nOn January 21, 2010, Applicant answered the SOR in writing and elected to have \nthe case decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. On March 12, 2010, \nDepartment Counsel prepared a File of Relevant Material (FORM) containing 13 Items, \nJune 29, 2010\n\n \n2 \n \n \nand mailed Applicant a complete copy on March 16, 2010. Applicant received the \nFORM on March 22, 2010, and had 30 days from its receipt to file objections and submit \nadditional information. Applicant did not submit any additional information. On June 2, \n2010, DOHA assigned the case to me. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted all allegations. Those admissions \nare incorporated in the following findings. \n \n \nApplicant is a 41 years old. He is married and has four children. He has worked \nfor a defense contractor since August 1989. He is a crane foreman. (Item 4.)  \n \n \nIn January 2009, a government investigator interviewed Applicant to discuss two \ntax liens, delinquent credit accounts, and a December 2008 foreclosure. Applicant \nexplained that he and his wife stopped paying their mortgage sometime in 2007 when \nher mortgage business closed and their income decreased. Around that time, he \nfinancially helped family members with unforeseen medical expenses and other \nemergencies. Both situations created additional financial difficulties for him. (Item 8 at 6-\n7.) He told the investigator that he was resolving a credit card debt and making \narrangements to settle other debts. His wife was negotiating a settlement with the \nInternal Revenue Service (IRS) for the tax lien entered in 2009 and resolving the 2007 \nstate tax lien. (Id.) \n \n \nIn February 2009, the IRS sent a letter to Applicant and his wife advising them to \nfile an Offer in Compromise to resolve the outstanding federal tax lien. (Item 3 at 3.) In \nMay 2009, Applicant hired a lawyer to handle his mortgage problems. In September \n2009, Applicant executed a Loan Modification Agreement that required him to make \nmonthly payments of $2,643, beginning on October 1, 2009.1 He asserted that his \npayments are current, but did not submit proof that he made those payments over the \npast several months. (Item 3.)  \n \n \nIn July 2009, Applicant completed a set of Interrogatories, in which he \nacknowledged that the state tax lien for $1,676 was unresolved and anticipated \nconsolidating the debt \u201cwith other debts next month.\u201d (GE 10 at 2.) He reiterated his \nintention to consolidate a charge card debt and two other debts into a repayment \nagreement. (Id.) \n \n \nIn September 2009, Applicant spoke to a debt consolidation company over the \ntelephone for assistance in resolving his debts. After the consult, the company informed \n                                                          \n1According to the \u201cMaking Home Affordable\u201d documents applicable to the Loan Modification \nAgreement, Applicant is required during the trial period payment plan to work with an approved housing \ncounseling agency to create a budget and plan to reduce household debts. (Item 3 at 9.)  Applicant did \nnot provide documentation that he has done that to date. \n\n \n3 \n \n \nhim that his budget was unable to accommodate a plan for repaying his delinquent \ndebts.2 (Item 3 at 12, 13, 14.)  \n \nBased on credit bureau reports (CBR) from January 2009,  March 2009, October \n2009, and March 2010, the SOR alleged seven delinquent debts totaling approximately \n$127,924, and consisting primarily of past due mortgage payments and unpaid taxes \nthat started to become delinquent in March 2006.  \n \n \nIn his January 2010 Answer, Applicant stated that his 2008 tax refund resolved \nthe 2007 state tax lien of $1,676, alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a, but that he was waiting for \nverification. He answered that he was \u201capplying for Offer in Compromise\u201d to resolve the \n$45,014 federal tax lien, alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b. He provided no evidence to corroborate \nhis statements that he made the revised mortgage payments per the Loan Modification \nAgreement, in resolution of the unpaid mortgage amounts alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.c and \u00b6 \n1.d.   \n \nApplicant\u2019s Answer acknowledged three debts and noted that he was unable to \nmanage them because he could not establish a debt consolidation plan based on his \nlimited income.3  The $658 credit card debt, alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.e, remains unresolved. \nThe $490 debt owed to a collections service agency, alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.f, is \nunresolved. The $305 insurance company debt, alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.g, is unresolved.   \n \n Applicant provided no evidence concerning the quality of his recent job \nperformance. He submitted no character references or other evidence tending to \nestablish good judgment, trustworthiness, or reliability. I was unable to evaluate his \ncredibility, demeanor, or character in person since he elected to have his case decided \nwithout a hearing. \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the Adjudicative Guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \n                                                          \n2Applicant\u2019s Answer referenced the date of contact with that agency as \u201c9/14/2008,\u201d but the \nexhibits submitted reference 2009 as the year of the contact. (Item 3 at 1.) \n \n3Applicant did not submit his monthly budget or any other documents related to his financial \nstatus.  \n\n \n4 \n \n \nthe whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14 requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d Section 7 \nof Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set \nout in AG & 18:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \nThe evidence established security concerns under two Guideline F disqualifying \nconditions; specifically, AG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts,@ and \nAG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations.@ Based on four CBRs and his \nadmissions, Applicant has been unable or unwilling to satisfy debts that began accruing \nin March 2006. He demonstrated a four-year history of not meeting significant financial \nobligations. The evidence is sufficient to raise these two disqualifying conditions. \n \nAfter the Government raised potential disqualifications, the burden shifted to \nApplicant to rebut or prove mitigation of those security concerns. The guideline includes \nfour conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising from financial difficulties in \nAG \u00b6 20. Under AG \u00b6 20(a), the disqualifying condition may be mitigated where Athe \nbehavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual=s \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ Applicant\u2019s financial delinquencies \narose in 2006 and remain unresolved to date. The debts are ongoing and not isolated. \nBecause there is insufficient evidence to support a finding that the delinquent \nindebtedness is unlikely to recur, this condition does not apply.   \n \nAG & 20(b) states that it may be mitigating where Athe conditions that resulted in \nthe financial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of \nemployment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce \nor separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.@ Applicant \nattributed his financial problems to unexpected family obligations and his wife\u2019s \nbusiness closing. Those may have been circumstances beyond his control; however, he \ndid not offer evidence demonstrating that he attempted to act responsibly while the \ndebts were accruing, or after they accrued, until 2009. This mitigating condition \nmarginally applies.  \n \nEvidence that \u201cthe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control\u201d \nis potentially mitigating under AG & 20(c). Similarly, AG & 20(d) applies where the \nevidence shows that Athe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue \ncreditors or otherwise resolve debts.@ Applicant established no mitigation under these \ntwo provisions. He submitted evidence that he had one telephone session with a credit \ncounseling service in September 2009, after which he learned that the company could \nnot help him. That is some evidence of mitigation under AG & 20(c). However, he did \nnot submit evidence indicating that his finances and delinquent debts are under control. \nHe did not provide substantive evidence that he paid or established a repayment plan \nfor any debt, including his tax liens or the smaller debts of $658, $490, and $305. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a). They include the following:  \n\n \n6 \n \n \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is a mature individual with \na long employment history with his employer. In January 2009, he learned of the \ngovernment\u2019s security concerns related to his financial obligations. In February 2009, \nthe IRS advised him to file a form to resolve his large tax lien. In January 2010, he \nindicated that he was \u201capplying for\u201d a tax settlement, but provided no proof that he had \nfiled the requested document. He stated in his Answer that he resolved a state tax lien \nwith a 2008 refund, but had not received verification from the taxing agency. In his \nAnswer, he asserted that he resolved his unpaid mortgage and began making payments \non a revised payment amount in October 2009, but did not submit proof of any \npayments. After learning from one debt consolidation company in September 2009 that \nhis current income would not accommodate delinquent debt payments, he did not take \nfurther steps to resolve the smaller debts. In March 2010, the government notified him in \nthe FORM that his file lacked sufficient proof of the resolution of his debts and gave him \n30 days to file additional documents to support his request for a security clearance. He \ndid not provide further information.  \n \nApplicant has had over a year to substantiate his claims that he was resolving his \ndelinquent financial obligations. He failed to demonstrate financial rehabilitation so a \nrecurrence of his financial problems is likely. The record contains insufficient other \nevidence about his character, trustworthiness, or responsibility to mitigate these \nconcerns or make their continuation less likely. \n \nOverall, the record evidence creates substantial doubt as to Applicant\u2019s present \neligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude \nApplicant did not mitigate the security concerns arising from his financial considerations. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.g:  \n     Against Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

Applicant gave\nMarch 3, 2010\n\n Applicant used marijuana about 40 times over 10 years, mostly in college. He described his use as\n      2\n\u201cexperimental and recreational. . . .

A-E. Applicant was given through February 4, 2010, to submit any\nadditional documentation. Department Counsel offered two documents, admitted as\nexhibits (Exs.) 1-2 without objection. The transcript (Tr.) of the proceeding was received\non January 29, 2010. On January 27, 2010, Applicant submitted three additional\ndocuments through Department Counsel, who forwarded the materials without objection\non February 26, 2010. They were accepted into the record as Exs. F-H and the record\nwas  closed. Based on a review of the testimony, submissions, and exhibits, I find\nApplicant met his burden regarding the drug involvement security concerns raised.\nSecurity clearance is granted.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 32-year-old staff mechanical engineer working for a government\ncontractor. He has worked for his present employer since 2001. His performance\nreviews indicate excellent professional skills. In completing his e-QIP, he completely\ndisclosed his past drug use and reviewed his answers for accuracy prior to its\nsubmission. Applicant has a bachelor\u2019s degree in mechanical engineering and is\nworking on a graduate degree. He is married and has one young child. \nWhile a college student in 1998, Applicant began using marijuana, an illegal\nsubstance, with varying frequency.  He obtained marijuana either through purchase\n2\nfrom friends or through shared use with friends, but he never sold the substance.  He\n3\ngraduated from college in 2000. In January 2001, he twice \u201cexperimented\u201d with ecstasy,\nan illegal psychoactive amphetamine which he was given.   A month later, Applicant\n4\nstarted his present position. In the summer of 2003, he tried hallucinogenic mushrooms,\nprohibited substances he was once given by a friend.  He describes his experience as\n5\n\u201cstrictly experimental.\u201d  \n6\nApplicant\u2019s father suffers from kidney stones, a condition from which Applicant\nalso suffers. Today, Applicant mostly manages pain related to this condition by drinking\nwater and using Ibuprofen.  Between 2005 and January 2009, however, he used\n7\nprescribed and unprescribed Percocet to help manage related pain on about 30\n\n Tr. 36. Evidence of a post-emergency room visit and Percocet prescription from December 2005 were\n      8\naccepted as Ex. G.\n Tr. 37. Because the onset of pain was irregular, one prescription \u201cwould last a very long time.\u201d See also\n      9\nEx. F (Letter of legal counsel).\n Tr. 57-58.\n      10\n Tr. 27-31.\n      11\n Tr. 34, compare Tr. 41 (Applicant no longer associates with those from whom he bought marijuana).\n      12\n Tr. 43, 49.\n      13\n Tr. 44, 49. (The couple jointly agreed to clean \u201cup their acts\u201d and focus on their marriage).\n      14\n Tr. 47; Ex. H (Statement).\n      15\n3\noccasions.  He did not use the medication for recreational purposes. Applicant was not\n8\non a regular dosage regimen and bouts of pain were irregular. While prescribed\nPercocet, he used pills prescribed to his father about 10 to 15 times to address pain\ncommencing when he visited his parents, and he did not have his own pills with him.  In\n9\nlight of his prescription and his medical condition, Applicant never considered whether\nusing his father\u2019s Percocet might be illegal.  He never used illegal drugs or illegally\n10\nused Percocet during the work day.\nIn 2007, Applicant was entertaining some friends. A friend who suffered from\nmigraines asked Applicant if he could have one of the Percocet pills that Applicant kept\nin his medicine cabinet. Applicant granted the request.  \nUltimately, Applicant quit using marijuana in June 2008, after becoming a father\nin May 2007 and getting married in July 2007.  His marijuana use after college was\n11\nsporadic. During the summer he was married and eventually quit using marijuana, he\nused marijuana socially with high school friends and his wife a couple of times. Today,\nhe rarely associates with these friends, all of whom are now married.  Their contact is\n12\nminimal, mostly through play dates for their children. He does not know if they still use\ndrugs. \nWhen Applicant quit using marijuana, he did so by quitting \u201ccold turkey.\u201d He had\nno difficulty with the process of eliminating his increasingly minimal use. He chose to do\nso for a variety of reasons. Having reached age 30, he realized he needed to comport\nhis behavior to his level of maturity. The birth of his child and the rush toward marriage\ntwo months later had been a \u201ccrash course on reality,\u201d emphasizing his need to get\nhimself \u201cin line and start being responsible for the other people in [his] life.\u201d  In light of\n13\ntheir situation, and their fast acquisition of a home in a new area, the couple decided to\ncommit themselves to their marriage and child, forego drugs in the future, and make a\n\u201cfresh start.\u201d  Both are committed to staying drug-free. Applicant has executed a\n14\ndocument indicating his willingness to have a security clearance revoked should he\never again abuse drugs.  He has never been referred for drug counseling or felt the\n15\n\n Exs. A-D (References).\n      16\n Tr. 45.\n      17\n Tr. 45-46.\n      18\n Tr. 62.\n      19\n Tr. 50.\n      20\n Tr. 52. Before his marriage, Applicant used to go out on weekends and imbibe alcohol. Today, he has\n      21\nan alcoholic beverage \u201cevery few weeks,\u201d usually with dinner or with friends Tr. 52. He partly attributed his\nminimal drinking of alcoholic beverages on the fact that \u201ceverybody has kind of gotten into the parenthood\nthing. So it is not really, it is not around.\u201d Tr. 53.\n Tr. 51.\n      22\n Tr. 53.\n      23\n Revised Adjudicative Guideline (AG) \u00b6 24.\n      24\n4\nneed to seek counseling. He has been drug-free since June 2008, nearly 21 months\nago. \nAt work, Applicant is a trusted and valued employee.  He has not had any\n16\nunexcused absences, and he has not been cited for any violations of company rules or\npolicies.  His present employer conducts drug screening. Applicant passed the one\n17\ndrug test he was administered while working for his current employer.  He has received\n18\n\u201ca broad spectrum of [drug] awareness training.\u201d19\nApplicant\u2019s social life has radically changed since starting a family. He spends\nmost of his time with his wife and daughter. Any available free time is spent working on\nhis house and chaperoning play dates for his child. He plays golf when he can, but\n\u201cpartying\u201d with friends is a social aspect of his life that had diminished by the late\n2000s.  His current use of alcohol is \u201calmost non-existent.\u201d  His current peers are\n20\n21\nmostly professional colleagues or fellow parents of young children who lead settled\nlives.  Applicant\u2019s wife is a social worker who has worked for the same employer for\n22\nabout three years. She does not have a criminal record or any dependency issues.\nThey socialize about once a month.23\nAnalysis\nUnder Guideline H, use of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can\nraise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because it may\nimpair judgment and because it raises questions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness\nto comply with laws, rules, and regulations.  \u201cDrugs\u201d are defined as mood and behavior\n24\naltering substances, and include drugs, materials, and other chemical compounds\nidentified and listed in the Controlled Substances Act of 1970, as amended, (e.g.,\nmarijuana or cannabis, depressants, narcotics, stimulants, and hallucinogens) and\n\n Id. at \u00b6 24(a)(1-2).\n      25\n Id. at 24(b).\n      26\n5\ninhalants and other substances.  \u201cDrug abuse\u201d is the illegal use of a drug or use of a\n25\nlegal drug in a manner that deviates from approved medical direction.  \n26\nApplicant admitted using and purchasing marijuana, using ecstasy and\nhallucinogenic mushrooms, and using Percocet prescribed for someone other than\nhimself. These admissions are sufficient to raise Drug Involvement Disqualifying\nCondition (DI DC) AG \u00b6 25(a) (\u201cany drug abuse\u201d). With a disqualifying condition raised,\nit is Applicant\u2019s burden to mitigate security concerns.\nWith regard to Applicant\u2019s relatively isolated use of ecstasy and his\nexperimentation with hallucinogenic mushrooms, those substances were used in 2001\nand 2003, respectively, and he has not again abused those drugs. When he \u201cborrowed\u201d\nPercocet from his father, he did so knowing he had a prescription for the medication of\nhis own at his own home, but the onset of pain occurred when he was visiting his\nparents. At the time, he did not understand that treating their prescriptions as fungible\ncould have legal consequences. Today, he understands the repercussions. With regard\nto the ecstasy, mushrooms, and borrowed Percocet, Drug Involvement Mitigating\nCondition (DI MC) AG \u00b6 26(a) (\u201cthe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent,\nor happened under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt\non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment\u201d) applies. To a\nlesser degree, it also applies to the 2007 incident when he permitted a friend to have\none of his personally prescribed Percocet. The incident was not recent, and, in light of\nApplicant\u2019s credible testimony, it is clear he did not understand the legal nuance of\ngranting permission to his friend, who had a migraine, to use one of his prescription\nmedications. This mitigating condition does not, however, apply to Applicant\u2019s use of\nmarijuana.\nAlthough Applicant quit using marijuana about 21 months ago, the circumstances\nunder which he foreswore the drug are significant. In short order, Applicant went from a\nsocially active bachelor to father and husband in what he concedes was a rushed\narrangement. Within a year, the reality of his new situation became apparent. He\nrecognized that he was older, more mature, and that, even though his use of marijuana\nhad become minimal, it was time for him to comport his behavior to that which was\nappropriate for a professional adult. Of equal importance was the joint decision by\nApplicant and his wife to genuinely work on becoming responsible adults, spouses, and\nparents. Although this decision was made a year after the birth of their child and their\nmarriage, their circumstances were unique and not traditional. They jointly committed to\ngive up all drugs and have stayed drug-free for nearly two years. \nDuring that time, Applicant shifted his focus to his family and his home. He no\nlonger focuses on a bachelor\u2019s lifestyle or the buddies with whom he used to use drugs.\nIn the interim, most of those friends have also matured, married, and become parents.\nToday, he has little to no contact with those who use drugs or circumstances in which\ndrugs may be present. Moreover, Applicant has signed a statement of intent with\n\n6\nautomatic revocation of clearance for any future drug use. These efforts are significant,\nas are the facts related to Applicant\u2019s minimal use of marijuana at the time he quit\ndrugs, the intervening period since he used other illegal substances, and his\nunderstanding of the legalities and responsibilities associated with prescription\nmedication. Such understanding and efforts are further fortified by the interdependent\nsupport offered between Applicant and his wife in their attempts to work on building a\nfamily and serving as role models for their child. Therefore, DI MC AG \u00b6 26(b) (a\ndemonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future such as: (1) disassociation\nfrom drug-using associates and cotnacts; (2) changing or avoiding the environment\nwhere drugs were used; (3) an appropriate period of abstinence; and (4) a signed\nstatement of intent with automatic revocation of clearance for any violation) apply.\nThere is no evidence that Applicant abused drugs, such as Percocet, prescribed to him,\nnor is their evidence treatment at a prescribed drug treatment program or facility was\nwarranted. Consequently, none of the remaining mitigating conditions are applicable.\nApplicant has been drug-free for approximately 21 months. He quit using drugs\n\u201ccold turkey\u201d without difficulty. He and his wife maintain a drug-free home and socialize\nin drug-free venues. Neither drugs, alcohol, or suspect influences remain in their lives\nas they endeavor to work on their marriage and their roles as responsible, professional\nparents. Drugs are no longer compatible with their lifestyle. Applicant credibly and\nunequivocally expressed his intent not to use drugs in the future. As a safeguard, he\nhas signed a statement of intent with automatic revocation of clearance for any violation\nconcerning illegal or improper drug use. His place of employment utilizes drug testing to\ncheck for drug abuse. Drug involvement security concerns are mitigated.\n.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of an applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant a security clearance\nmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the\nguidelines and the whole person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case, as well as the \u201cwhole person\u201d\nfactors.  Here, Applicant used illegal drugs and used his father\u2019s prescription drugs\n\n7\nillegally in his 20s, slowly phasing out his drug use until he was only a minimal\nmarijuana user in his very early 30s. His drug abuse was social and he knew it was\nproscribed. As he matured, however, his drug use diminished. When he suddenly found\nhimself a father and husband, the reality of his new situation took about a year to\naccept. Ultimately, he and his wife made the affirmative decision to quit drugs, eschew\ntheir use in the future, and focus on their new family. They have changed their lifestyle\nand their priorities. Neither has used drugs in nearly 21 months. \nIn his efforts to stay drug free, Applicant has more than self resolve for support.\nThe decision to quit drugs was jointly made with his wife. His employer utilizes drug\nscreening. Additionally, he has signed a letter of intent with automatic revocation of his\nsecurity clearance should he waver and return to drugs.\nApplicant\u2019s past use and abuse of Percocet presents a somewhat distinct\nsubcategory of drug abuse. Here, Applicant was initially prescribed the medication for\npain associated from chronic and recurring kidney stones, a condition that apparently\nruns in his family. For the most part, this condition is now managed through legally\navailable substances. Still, Percocet was prescribed and used. Not having specialized\nknowledge as to whether prescribed medications were fungible amongst family\nmembers and similarly situated patients, he did not think twice about using one of his\nfather\u2019s Percocet with his father\u2019s permission when kidney stone pain commenced while\nhe visited his parents and his own Percocet supply was unavailable. He similarly did not\ngive thorough thought to permitting a friend suffering from a migraine to take one of his\nown Percocet for pain. Today, Applicant understands the legality of using medications\nprescribed for others, regardless of whether one has their own prescription for the same\nmedication. Understanding such legalities, and in light of his current methods for\ndealing with kidney stone related pain, there is no evidence that such past sharing of\nprescription medication will be repeated. With security concerns regarding his drug\ninvolvement mitigated, I conclude it is clearly consistent with national security to grant\nApplicant a security clearance. Clearance is granted. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline H:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nFor Applicant\n\n8\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant a security clearance.\nClearance is granted.\nARTHUR E.

Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.  \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn August 27, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued \na Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under \nGuidelines J (Criminal Conduct), D (Sexual Behavior), and E (Personal Conduct). The \naction was taken under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense \nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) \npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the \nDepartment of Defense (DoD) for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on October 2, 2009, and elected to have \nthe case decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. Department Counsel \nMarch 19, 2010\n\n \n2 \n \nsubmitted the government\u2019s written case on December 7, 2009. A complete copy of the \nfile of relevant material (FORM) was provided to Applicant, who was afforded an \nopportunity to file objections and submit material to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the \nsecurity concerns. Applicant received the FORM on December 14, 2009. As of February \n18, 2010, he had not responded. The case was assigned to me on February 19, 2010. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is a 41-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He is seeking to \nretain a security clearance. He served on active duty in the United States Navy from \n1986 until he retired with an honorable discharge as a second class petty officer in \n2006. He attended college for a period, but it is unclear if he obtained a degree. He \nreported on a 2005 security clearance application that he was married since 1989. It is \nunclear if he is still married, but he appears to be at least separated. He reported four \nchildren, ages 20, 18, 9, and 8.1  \n \n \nApplicant was drinking at a party at a friend\u2019s home in June 2008. He was drunk \nand went to a bedroom where a 15-year-old girl had fallen asleep after drinking alcohol. \nHe performed inappropriate sexual acts on her while she was drunk or passed out.2   \n \n \nApplicant was arrested the next day and charged with the felony offenses of rape \nby foreign object \u2013 unconscious victim, and two counts of lewd act upon a child 14 or 15 \nyears of age. In August 2008, he pled guilty to a lesser included offense of the first \ncharge. He admitted to the court that he \u201cunlawfully attempted to penetrate the sexual \norgan of another with [his] fingers for the purpose of sexual gratification.\u201d In November \n2008, he was sentenced to 365 days in jail with credit for 7 days, supervised probation \nfor three years expiring in November 2011, attend counseling, pay restitution and a fine, \nand register as a sex offender. He is a registered sex offender and remains on \nprobation.3 \n \n \nIn September 2008, Applicant told a background investigator that on the night in \nquestion, he had between eight to ten drinks, a combination of beer, mixed drinks, and \nshots of tequila. He stated that he rarely drinks to intoxication and did not believe his \ndrinking affected his judgment or reliability. He stated that he had reduced his drinking, \nand he only had alcohol on one occasion since his arrest, when he drank two beers at \ndinner with his girlfriend. He stated that his arrest is common knowledge and he is not \nsusceptible to blackmail or coercion. Applicant\u2019s security officer is aware of his criminal \nrecord.4 \n \n \n                                                          \n1 Items 4, 5. \n \n2 Items 3, 5-10. \n \n3 Id. \n \n4 Items 5, 10. \n\n \n3 \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to \npotential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \n \n \n \n\n \n4 \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct  \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Criminal Conduct is set out in \nAG \u00b6 30: \n \nCriminal activity creates doubt about an Applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, \nand trustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s \nability or willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 31 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following are potentially applicable:  \n \n(a) a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses;  \n \n(c) allegation or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the \nperson was formally charged, formally prosecuted or convicted; and \n \n(d) individual is currently on parole or probation. \n \nApplicant committed a serious crime in June 2008. He remains on probation until \nNovember 2011. All of the above disqualifying conditions have been established.  \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.b alleges that Applicant is a registered sex offender. That is true, but it \ndoes not state any criminal conduct that is not already alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a. SOR \u00b6 1.b \nis concluded for Applicant.  \n \nFour Criminal Conduct mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 32 are potentially \napplicable:  \n \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n \n(b) the person was pressured or coerced into committing the act and those \npressures are no longer present in the person\u2019s life;  \n \n(c) evidence that the person did not commit the offense; and \n \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited \nto the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or \nrestitution, job training or higher education, good employment record, or \nconstructive community involvement. \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s criminal conduct was in June 2008, and he will be on probation until \nNovember 2011. I find under the circumstances that the conduct was recent. There was \nnothing so \u201cunusual\u201d about the circumstances leading to the crime that I can find that it \nis unlikely to recur. It adversely reflects on Applicant\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, \nand good judgment. AG \u00b6 32(a) is not applicable. There is insufficient evidence to \nwarrant the application of any other Criminal Conduct mitigating conditions. \n \nGuideline D, Sexual Behavior \n \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Sexual Behavior is set out in AG \n\u00b6 12: \n \nSexual behavior that involves a criminal offense, indicates a personality or \nemotional disorder, reflects lack of judgment or discretion, or which can \nsubject the individual to undue influence or coercion, exploitation, or \nduress can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness \nand ability to protect classified information. No adverse inference \nconcerning the standards in this Guideline may be raised solely on the \nbasis of the sexual orientation of the individual.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 13 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying conditions are potentially applicable:  \n \n(a) sexual behavior of a criminal nature, whether or not the individual has \nbeen prosecuted; \n \n(c) sexual behavior that causes an individual to be vulnerable to coercion, \nexploitation, or duress; and  \n \n(d) sexual behavior of a public nature and/or that reflects lack of discretion \nor judgment.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s sexual offense against a 15-year-old girl establishes all the above \ndisqualifying conditions.  \nConditions that could mitigate Sexual Behavior security concerns are provided \nunder AG \u00b6 14. The following are potentially applicable: \n(b) the sexual behavior happened so long ago, so infrequently, or under \nsuch unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and  \n(c) the behavior no longer serves as a basis for coercion, exploitation, or \nduress.  \n\n \n6 \n \n \nAG \u00b6 14(b) is not applicable for the same rationale discussed above. Applicant \nstated that his arrest is common knowledge. That has lessened, but not eliminated, his \nvulnerability to coercion, exploitation, and duress. AG \u00b6 14(c) is partially applicable.  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s actions were so egregious that Sexual Behavior concerns remain \ndespite the presence of some mitigation.  \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct  \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in \nAG \u00b6 15: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying condition is potentially applicable: \n \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s \nconduct, that creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or \nduress, such as . . . engaging in activities which, if known, may affect the \nperson\u2019s personal, professional, or community standing.  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s crimes led to a conviction and registration as a sex offender. That \nconduct created a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, and duress. AG \u00b6 16(e) is \napplicable. \n \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following \nare potentially applicable:  \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, \nor other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur; and \n \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress. \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \nAG \u00b6 17(c) is not applicable for the same rationale discussed under the Criminal \nConduct analysis. Applicant received some counselling as a requirement of his \nprobation. Details were not provided. I cannot make an affirmative finding from the \nlimited information in the record that the behavior is unlikely to recur. AG \u00b6 17(d) is \npartially applicable. Applicant\u2019s arrest is common knowledge, which has lessened his \nvulnerability to coercion, exploitation, and duress. AG \u00b6 14(e) is partially applicable.  \n \n \nIn sum, I conclude that Personal Conduct concerns are still present despite the \npresence of some mitigation.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guidelines J, D, and E in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 \n2(a) were addressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional comment.  \n \nI considered Applicant\u2019s honorable military service. However, he was a mature \nman when he sexually abused a 15-year-old girl in June 2008. He is a registered sex \noffender and remains on probation until November 2011. I have significant concerns \nabout his judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has not mitigated Criminal Conduct, Sexual Behavior, and Personal \nConduct security concerns. \n \n \n \n\n \n8 \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline J:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline D:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nParagraph 3, Guideline E:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 3.a:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nEdward W.

Eligibility \nfor access to classified information is denied.  \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn September 11, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) \nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under \nGuideline C, Foreign Preference. The action was taken under Executive Order (EO) \n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nadjudicative guidelines (AG).  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on November 13, 2009, and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge. The case was assigned to another administrative judge \non December 22, 2009. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on January 4, 2010, \nscheduling the hearing for January 28, 2010. Applicant\u2019s request for a continuance was \nApril 7, 2010\n\n \n2 \n \ngranted. The continuance request, Department Counsel\u2019s objection, and the previous \njudge\u2019s memorandum for the record are marked collectively as Hearing Exhibit (HE) I. \nThe case was reassigned to me on January 20, 2010. DOHA issued a second notice of \nhearing on January 22, 2010, and the hearing was convened as scheduled on February \n22, 2010. The Government offered Exhibits (GE) 1 through 3, which were received \nwithout objection. Applicant testified on her own behalf and submitted Exhibits (AE) A \nthrough J, which were admitted without objection. DOHA received the transcript of the \nhearing (Tr.) on March 2, 2010.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is a 44-year-old employee of a defense contractor. She held a \nclearance from the Department of Homeland Security. She is applying for Department \nof Defense industrial security clearance. She was born in Germany. She is a graduate \nof a German university. She was married in 1986 and divorced in 1987. She married a \nsecond time in 1992 and divorced in 2000. She married her current husband in 2001. \nShe has two children, ages 22 and 18.1  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s first two husbands were German citizens. Her current husband has \nbeen a U.S. citizen since birth. Applicant immigrated to the United States in 2002, and \nbecame a U.S. citizen in September 2006. She received a U.S. passport the following \nmonth. Her children live in the United States and both attend U.S. universities. Her \nmother, aunt, and two siblings still live in Germany.2 \n \n \nApplicant is dual citizen of the United States and Germany. She possesses a \nGerman passport that was issued in April 2002, and will not expire until April 2012. She \nused the German passport to travel to Germany in 2009. She used her U.S. passport \nwhen she entered and exited another country in 2007. She is unwilling to relinquish the \nGerman passport, and she intends to renew it upon its expiration. Her mother and aunt \nare both 70 years old. Her siblings do not live close to her mother and aunt. Applicant \nwants to keep her German passport in order to properly identify herself in Germany in \ncase she has to make a decision or sign any documents on their behalf, such as their \nadmission to a hospital or a nursing home. She stated that she needs the German \npassport as long as her mother and aunt are alive. She submitted a notarized sworn \nstatement that she will not use the German passport for travel purposes and will only \ntravel on her U.S. passport. She will not renew her German passport after her mother \nand aunt pass away. Applicant has not voted in any German elections since she \nbecame a U.S. citizen. She certified that she will not vote in German elections. She is a \nregistered voter and has voted in the United States.3 \n \n                                                          \n1 Tr. at 17-21, 31, 35; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1; AE D. \n \n2 Tr. at 24, 28, 31-32, 35; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1-3; AE B. \n \n3 Tr. at 23-25, 28-29, 35-340; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1-3; AE G, H. \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \nApplicant credibly testified that she is a loyal U.S. citizen. She is a generous \ndonor to U.S. charities. She does not donate to German charities. She pays her U.S. \ntaxes and does not have a criminal record. Except for holding a German passport, she \nhas received no other benefits from Germany since becoming a U.S. citizen. She has \nabout $16,800 in shares of a German company, as a retirement account. She also has \nabout $75,000 in checking and savings accounts in German banks. Her U.S. assets in \nchecking and savings accounts, 401(k), and annuities total about $420,000.4  \n \n \nApplicant submitted several letters attesting to her patriotism and loyalty to the \nUnited States. She is described as a proud American citizen with strong moral values, \nintegrity, and character.5 \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable decision.  \n \n                                                          \n4 Tr. at 26-36, 40-41; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; AE I, J. \n \n5 AE A. \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline C, Foreign Preference \n \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Foreign Preference is set out in \nAG \u00b6 9: \n \nWhen an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a \nforeign country over the United States, then he or she may be prone to \nprovide information or make decisions that are harmful to the interests of \nthe United States. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 10. One is potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(a) exercise of any right, privilege or obligation of foreign citizenship after \nbecoming a U.S. citizen or through the foreign citizenship of a family \nmember. This includes but is not limited to: \n(1) possession of a current foreign passport; and \n(7) voting in a foreign election. \n  \nApplicant possesses a current German passport, which is a right and privilege of \nforeign citizenship. AG \u00b6 10(a) is applicable to the information alleged under SOR \n\u00b61.a.(1).  \n \n  \nSOR \u00b6 1.a.(2) alleges that Applicant \u201cmaintained [her] German passport, in part, \nso that [she is] able to vote in future German elections.\u201d That information has not been \nestablished. Applicant has not voted in a German election since becoming a U.S. \ncitizen, and has no intention of voting there in the future. The information alleged under \nSOR \u00b6 1.a.(2) is concluded for Applicant. \n\n \n5 \n \nConditions that could mitigate Foreign Preference security concerns are provided \nunder AG \u00b6 11. Three are potentially applicable: \n \n(a) dual citizenship is based solely on parents\u2019 citizenship or birth in a \nforeign country; \n \n(b) the individual has expressed a willingness to renounce dual \ncitizenship; and \n \n(e) the passport has been destroyed, surrendered to the cognizant \nsecurity authority, or otherwise invalidated. \n \nApplicant actively exercised her German citizenship by using her German \npassport after she became an American citizen. She declared that she will not use the \npassport to travel. She is maintaining the passport to identify herself as a German \ncitizen should the need arise to assist her mother and aunt. As such, she is unwilling to \nrenounce the dual citizenship that accompanies the German passport. No mitigating \ncondition is completely applicable.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.       \n  \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guideline C in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(a) were \naddressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment.  \n \nApplicant was honest and forthright at her hearing. There is no evidence that \nApplicant is anything other than an intelligent, honest, trustworthy, and loyal U.S. \n\n \n6 \n \ncitizen. However, she was unable to mitigate the considerable security concerns raised \nby her possession of a current foreign passport.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has not mitigated Foreign Preference security concerns. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline C:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a.(1): \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a.(2): \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nEdward W.

Under Guideline E, personal conduct, Applicant was alleged to have deliberately falsified a November 2009 [sic] e-QIP by indicating that he had used marijuana five times and not fully disclosing the extent of his marijuana use (SOR 2.a). Applicant 1 admitted the Guideline H allegations, explaining that he used marijuana recreationally on no more than ten occasions over six years. He expressed his intent to abstain from any illegal drug use in the future because he realized in the summer of 2008 that it was inconsistent with his personal and professional career goals.

Marine, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Brian R. Sullivan, Esquire\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nMATCHINSKI, Elizabeth M., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant smoked marijuana once each in 2000 and in June 2002, and up to ten\nmore times from June 2004 until August 2008. The drug involvement concerns are\nmitigated by his change to a drug-free lifestyle. Personal conduct concerns are not\nsufficient to deny Applicant access because any minimization on his part was minimal\nand rectified at his first opportunity. Clearance is granted.\nStatement of the Case \nApplicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing\n(e-QIP) on November 25, 2008. On April 27, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and\nAppeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing the\nsecurity concerns under Guideline H and Guideline E that provided the basis for its\npreliminary decision to deny him a security clearance. The action was taken under\nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February\n20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial\nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended\nSeptember 30, 2009\n\nThe reference in the SOR to a November 25, 2009, e-QIP is attributed to inadvertent typographical\n1\nerror. The e-QIP (Ex. 1) is dated November 25, 2008. Neither party expressed confusion about which e-QIP\nApplicant was alleged to have falsified.\n2\n(Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on\nDecember 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense as of September 1,\n2006. \nApplicant received the SOR on April 30, 2009. On May 17, 2009, he answered\nthe SOR and requested a hearing before a DOHA administrative judge. The case was\nassigned to me on June 3, 2009, to consider whether it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant or continue a security clearance for him. On July 10, 2009, I\nscheduled a hearing for July 30, 2009.\nThe hearing was held as scheduled. The government initially submitted four\nexhibits, which were marked for identification (Ex. 1-4). Counsel for Applicant objected\nto the admission of proposed Exhibit 3, a report of personal subject interview, separate\nfrom Applicant\u2019s response to interrogatories (Ex. 2). Department Counsel then moved to\ninclude the report of subject interview in Exhibit 2, and her motion was granted without\nany objections. Accordingly, three government exhibits (Ex. 1, 2, 4) were entered into\nthe record without any objections. Applicant submitted three exhibits (Ex. A-C), which\nwere accepted into the record with no objections. Applicant and one witness also\ntestified on his behalf, as reflected in a transcript (Tr.) received on August 7, 2009.\nFindings of Fact\nIn the SOR, DOHA alleged under Guideline H, drug involvement, that Applicant\nused marijuana from about 2000 to at least August 2008 (SOR 1.a), and that he \u201cplaced\nmoney\u201d toward the purchase of marijuana in at least the summer of 2008 (SOR 1.b).\nUnder Guideline E, personal conduct, Applicant was alleged to have deliberately\nfalsified a November 2009 [sic] e-QIP by indicating that he had used marijuana five\ntimes and not fully disclosing the extent of his marijuana use (SOR 2.a).  Applicant\n1\nadmitted the Guideline H allegations, explaining that he used marijuana recreationally\non no more than ten occasions over six years. He expressed his intent to abstain from\nany illegal drug use in the future because he realized in the summer of 2008 that it was\ninconsistent with his personal and professional career goals. Applicant denied deliberate\nfalsification, and averred that he had given his best estimate at the time about the\nnumber of occasions on which he used marijuana. After considering the pleadings,\nexhibits, and transcript, I make the following findings of fact.\nApplicant is a 23-year-old associate software engineer who has worked for a\ndefense contractor since mid-October 2008 (Ex. 1, Tr. 30-31). He seeks a security\nclearance so that he can work on some classified projects (Tr. 55).\n\n3\nApplicant first smoked marijuana as a freshman in high school in the fall of 2000\n(Ex. 1, Tr.  41, 59). He last smoked marijuana in August 2008, the summer after he\ngraduated from college (Tr. 41). He does not recall the exact number of times that he\nused marijuana other than it was no more than ten times since the age of 16 (2002).\n(Ex. 2, Tr. 42, 48, 50). Applicant abstained from marijuana use from June 2002, after\nan adverse reaction (panic attack) from smoking the drug, until the fall of 2004. He\nsmoked the drug always with one or both of two friends from high school (Tr. 59). One\nof these friends went to the same university with him after high school. Applicant\nsmoked marijuana with him on one occasion during the fall of their freshman year. He\nclaims to not recall any other use in college (Tr. 62). Applicant did not purchase\nmarijuana himself, but on one occasion, he gave this friend some money toward a\npurchase of marijuana in the summer of 2008 at his friend\u2019s request (Ex. 2, Tr. 57). His\nfriends otherwise provided the marijuana at no cost to him (\u201cIt was always my friend just\nhad it.\u201d Tr. 58).\nApplicant did not allow his use of marijuana to impact his studies at the state\nuniversity, where he was in the Honors College and required to write, and present, a\nthesis during his senior year. Applicant was a member of the university\u2019s crew team\nfrom the spring semester freshman year until his junior year. He took the sport very\nseriously and did not smoke marijuana during crew season. During his senior year,\nApplicant wrote his honors thesis on robotics and he also worked as an intern writing\nsoftware programs for a local company involved in small business innovative research\ngrants from the government (Tr. 56). In May 2008, he earned his bachelor of science\ndegree in computer science with a grade point average of 3.66 (Tr. 33-36, 62-63).\nDuring the summer of 2008, Applicant continued working as an intern while\nresiding in his hometown (Ex. 1, Tr. 36). He smoked marijuana on at least one occasion\nthat summer, in August 2008. After he was called back for interviews by potential\nemployers (Tr. 56), he resolved to not use any illegal drug in the future because it was\nincompatible with his professional and personal goals (Ex. 2).\nIn October 2008, Applicant relocated to an adjacent state where he began\nworking for his present employer. On November 25, 2008, Applicant completed an e-\nQIP in application for a security clearance for his duties writing computer code (Tr. 32).\nHe responded \u201cYes\u201d to question 24.a, \u201cSince the age of 16 or in the last 7 years,\nwhichever is shorter, have you illegally used any controlled substance, for example,\nmarijuana, cocaine, crack cocaine, hashish, narcotics (opium, morphine, codeine,\nheroin, etc.), amphetamines, depressants (barbiturates, methaqualone, tranquilizers,\netc.), hallucinogenics (LSD, PCP, etc.), or prescription drugs?,\u201d and he indicated that he\nused marijuana five times from about June 2002 to present (Ex. 1, Tr. 39-41).\nOn December 15, 2008, Applicant was contacted by an investigator for the\ngovernment. Later that day, they met in Applicant\u2019s office at work where Applicant was\ninterviewed about his marijuana use. Applicant told the investigator that he had used\nmarijuana approximately ten times since the age of 16, the first time as a freshman in\nhigh school in the fall of 2000, and the last time in August 2008. Applicant named the\n\n4\ntwo friends with whom he had used the marijuana. He indicated that he stopped using\nmarijuana and did not intend to use it in the future because he realized it did not benefit\nhim and he did not want to lose his job over it. The investigator reported that Applicant\nalso stated that he had not been completely honest on his SF 86 about the number of\ntimes that he used marijuana because he was nervous that he would lose his job, but\nthat he realized during his subject interview that it was best to tell the truth (Ex. 2).\nOn March 11, 2009, DOHA forwarded interrogatories to Applicant, asking him to\nreview the enclosed investigator\u2019s summary of his interview and to verify its accuracy\n(Ex. 4). In his response of April 1, 2009, Applicant checked off \u201cYes\u201d as to whether the\ninvestigator\u2019s summary accurately reflected the information he had provided during his\ninterview. He offered no corrections, but added the following:\nThe intent of this letter is to reflect on my past use of marijuana and to\nprovide assurance of ceased future use. At this point, I now see my past\nuse as juvenile and an unnecessary deviation from my personal and\nprofessional goals. Realizing that I have now entered a new period in my\nlife by starting a professional career and moving from my home in [state\nname omitted], I have ceased my use of marijuana and wish to continue\nmy abstinence from this point forward. As a mark of seriousness on this\nissue, I would like to submit a signed statement indicating my intent to not\nuse again. Under DODD 5220.6, Enclosure 1, Section H, #26, this is listed\nas a condition that could mitigate security concerns.\nApplicant included as a separate attachment an unsigned, typewritten statement of his\nintent to abstain from the use of marijuana starting from March 31, 2009, with automatic\nrevocation of his clearance for any violation. The response to interrogatories, which\nincluded this statement, was signed and notarized (Ex. 2). \nOn April 27, 2009, DOHA issued the SOR, alleging in part that Applicant had\nfalsified his e-QIP by not fully disclosing the number of times that he had used\nmarijuana. In his response of May 17, 2009, Applicant denied that he deliberately\nmisrepresented his drug use when he completed his SF 86 and stated in relevant part,\n\u201cI signed a statement admitting my past use of marijuana and based on my best\nmemory and estimate at the time indicated that the number of occasions was five (5).\u201d\nHe explained that as the interview went on, he became \u201cextremely nervous\u201d that he may\nhave used it more frequently than previously reported, so he indicated that he may have\nused it on more than five occasions but not more than ten. He maintained that on the e-\nQIP and during his interview, he told the truth based on \u201c[his] best memory and belief.\u201d\n(Answer).\nApplicant testified at his hearing on July 30, 2009, about his December 2008\npersonal subject interview. As the interview neared its end, Applicant asked the\ninvestigator if he could correct a statement he had made previously about the number of\ntimes he had used marijuana. He \u201cstarted questioning whether it was five, four, six . . .\nand [he] was scared that maybe that wasn\u2019t as accurate as it could have been, so [he]\n\n5\nfelt more comfortable saying ten, because [he] knew it was no more than ten.\u201d (Tr. 47-\n48).  On cross-examination, Applicant testified that he made his \u201cbest guess\u201d on his e-\nQIP about the extent of his marijuana use (Tr. 66). He disclosed marijuana use to\n\u201cpresent\u201d on his e-QIP because he assumed August 2008 was present time (Tr. 67). He\ndenied ever telling the investigator that he had not been completely honest. Rather, he\nhad said to the investigator, \u201cI find this silly, or something like that, I don\u2019t want to lose\nmy job over something like this.\u201d (Tr. 73). He admits he was worried about his job, but\ncontinues to maintain that he was completely honest on his application (Tr. 74).\nAs of late July 2009, Applicant was sharing a rental unit with three others who\nwere employed in the area (Tr. 37). To the best of his knowledge, none of his house\nmates use illegal drugs (Tr. 52). Applicant had not used any illegal drugs since August\n2008. He socializes with a former college roommate who was on the crew team with\nhim before this roommate transferred to another university during the spring of their\nsophomore year. Their activities involve running and eating (Tr. 89). This friend, who\ntestified on Applicant\u2019s behalf, has never observed Applicant consume any illegal drug,\nto include marijuana (Tr. 90). He understands that Applicant used marijuana a couple of\ntimes in the past in high school (Tr. 93-94). In his experience, Applicant has been very\nloyal and supportive, hardworking, and very honest (Tr. 91-92).\nApplicant has not terminated his friendships with the two high school friends with\nwhom he smoked marijuana in the past, although he no longer sees them on a regular\nbasis. One friend still lives in their home state. Applicant has seen him three times since\nOctober 2008, twice back home and once \u201cmonths ago\u201d when this friend came to see\nhim (Tr. 79). Applicant\u2019s friend did not use marijuana in his presence and did not offer\nhim any marijuana during the three times they have gotten together (Tr. 75-80).\nApplicant has not told this friend that he is no longer using any illegal drugs \u201c[b]ecause I\nhaven\u2019t been using, it\u2019s not something we would just discuss, I guess.\u201d (Tr. 76).\nApplicant\u2019s other close friend from high school is presently attending a university nearby\nto Applicant. Applicant socialized with this friend sometime in April/May 2009 and again\nin June 2009. Applicant has not told this friend that he is no longer using marijuana (\u201cI\ndon\u2019t think it has come up\u201d). (Tr. 82).  Applicant testified he is unaware of whether either\nof these two friends still smoke marijuana (Tr. 76, 81). \nApplicant\u2019s work performance was evaluated at the end of his first three months\non the job. His performance was rated as competent overall. He had shown himself to\nbe a conscientious employee who paid attention to details (Ex. B). At his next appraisal\nin June 2009, Applicant was given an overall performance rating of superior.  He had\ntaken on challenging assignments and produced quality work each time. The director of\nengineering recommended that Applicant be given a $1,000 performance bonus (Ex. C,\nTr. 54).\nPolicies\nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the\nExecutive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security,\n\n6\nemphasizing that \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy\nv. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in\nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. These guidelines\nare not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior,\nthese guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative\nprocess. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and\ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious\nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The\nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person,\npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based\non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the\ngovernment must present evidence to establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and\nother evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or\nproven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The applicant has the ultimate burden of\npersuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship\ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government\nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk\nthat the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified\ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation\nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7\nof Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national\ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant\nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access\nto classified or sensitive information).\n\n7\nAnalysis\nGuideline H, Drug Involvement\nThe security concern about drug involvement is set out in AG \u00b6 24: \u201cUse of an\nillegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise questions about an individual\u2019s\nreliability and trustworthiness, both because it may impair judgment and because it\nraises questions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and\nregulations.\u201d Applicant smoked marijuana up to ten times while socializing with one or\nboth of two high school friends between 2000 and August 2008. AG \u00b6 25(a), \u201cany drug\nabuse,\u201d applies. The marijuana was given to him by his friends free of charge with the\napparent exception of the summer of 2008, when he contributed money toward the\npurchase of marijuana. AG \u00b6 25(c), \u201cillegal drug possession, including cultivation,\nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of drug\nparaphernalia,\u201d has limited applicability.\nIt is unclear how many times Applicant used marijuana during the summer of\n2008, but his use in August 2008 is too recent to fall within mitigating condition AG \u00b6\n26(a), \u201cthe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened under such\ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s\ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d\nThe evidence supports application of AG \u00b6 26(b)(4), \u201ca demonstrated intent not\nto abuse any drugs in the future, such as: (4) a signed statement of intent with\nautomatic revocation of clearance for any violation.\u201d During his subject interview in\nDecember 2008, Applicant indicated to a government investigator that he had ended his\nrecreational use of marijuana and did not intend any future use (Ex. 2). Then, in\nresponse to DOHA interrogatories, Applicant submitted a typewritten statement\nexpressing his willingness to abstain from the use of marijuana from March 31, 2009,\nwith automatic revocation of his clearance for any violation. Although the typewritten\nstatement was not signed, it was incorporated within his signed and notarized response\nto the interrogatories. Assuming that he would be required to complete a specific form\n(Tr. 69), Applicant reiterated in his SOR response that he would like to submit a signed\nstatement of his intent to refrain from future drug involvement. His statement provided\nwith his signed response to interrogatories is sufficient to satisfy AG \u00b6 26(b)(4).\nWith his relocation for his employment in October 2008, Applicant is no longer in\nthe same locale where he abused drugs in the past. There is no indication of illegal drug\ninvolvement by any of Applicant\u2019s current roommates or by the friend who rowed crew\nwith him in college and now frequently socializes with him.  AG \u00b6 26(b)(2), \u201cchanging or\navoiding the environment where drugs were used,\u201d applies. But Applicant also maintains\nhis friendships with the two persons involved in his abuse of marijuana in the past.\nWhile one friend still lives in their home state, Applicant and this friend have gotten\ntogether three times since October 2008. Applicant\u2019s other friend is attending a\nuniversity nearby to Applicant. Applicant saw him in June 2009 and before that in either\nApril or May 2009. Applicant testified, with no rebuttal from the government, that illegal\n\nApplicant recalled during his December 2008 subject interview, which took place less than one month\n2\nafter he completed his e-QIP, that he had a panic attack in June 2002 after smoking marijuana, and that he\nabstained thereafter for about two years. Applicant would have turned 16 in June 2002. It is not clear whether\nhis use of marijuana in June 2002 was before or after his birthday. Earlier use, including his first experience\nwith the drug in high school, would have fallen outside of the scope of the e-QIP inquiry.\n8\ndrugs were not involved in any of these visits. But in the absence of clear evidence that\nthese friends are no longer using marijuana, AG \u00b6 26(b)(1), \u201cdisassociation from drug-\nusing associates and contacts,\u201d does not apply. Applicant admitted at his hearing that\nhe does not know one way or the other whether these friends are currently using\nmarijuana.\nApplicant\u2019s case in mitigation is undermined somewhat by the fact that he has\nnot informed these close friends from high school that he is no longer using marijuana.\nEven though their recent contacts did not involve illegal drugs, Applicant could certainly\nhave brought up to his friends that he has foresworn any future illegal drug involvement.\nThe possibility of him being offered marijuana in the future cannot be ruled out based on\nthe evidence before me. However, his employment is likely to serve as a significant\ndeterrent to him using any illicit substances in the future. He was never a frequent user\nof marijuana, and did not seek out the drug when he used it. His present one year of a\ndrug-free lifestyle is sufficient for AG \u00b6 26(b)(3), \u201can appropriate period of abstinence,\u201d\nto apply, in light of his limited involvement in the past and his changed circumstances.\nGuideline E, Personal Conduct\nThe security concern about personal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 15:\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful\nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other\nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\nDOHA alleged personal conduct concerns because Applicant disclosed on his e-\nQIP that he used marijuana only five times since June 2004.  Applicant does not dispute\n2\nthat he had smoked marijuana approximately 10 times since age 16, which would have\nbeen from June 2002. Given he abstained after June 2002 until 2004, most of his illegal\ndrug use occurred during the time frame he listed on his SF 86. Applicant submits that\nthe discrepancy about the extent of his marijuana use (five versus up to ten times) was\nunintentional, and he made his \u201cbest estimate\u201d about the number of times he smoked\nmarijuana. \nTo meet its burden of intentional falsification, the government relies on an\nadmission against interest reportedly made by Applicant to the investigator during his\nsubject interview (\u201cThe subject stated that he was not completely honest on the SF 86\n\n9\nwhen providing the amount of times the subject used marijuana because he was\nnervous that he was going to lose his job . . . \u201d). Applicant denies he made that\nstatement to the interviewer, who did not testify: \nI never stated, I never told him that I was not completely honest, I told him\nthat I wanted to go back to a question, I just said I\u2019m trying to be\ncompletely honest here, and also during the course of the interview I said\nsomething about my job. I said I find this silly, or something like that, I\ndon\u2019t want to lose my job over something like this (Tr. 73).\nThe summary is not a verbatim recording of the interview. The investigator could have\nmisunderstood Applicant\u2019s motivations and reached his own conclusion that Applicant\nhad intentionally concealed the extent of his drug involvement when he completed his e-\nQIP. Applicant testified on direct examination that nervousness led him to rethink his\nmarijuana use (Tr. 45-45). Applicant was given the opportunity in April 2009 to review\nthe investigator\u2019s summary. Applicant verified its accuracy and made no effort to correct\nwhat the investigator wrote or to deny his reported admission that he had not been fully\nhonest about the number of times that he smoked marijuana. There is nothing in the\ninvestigator\u2019s summary to indicate that Applicant had estimated his marijuana use when\nhe completed his e-QIP.\nThe government must be assured that those persons with access to classified\ninformation can be counted on to fulfill their fiduciary obligations, including full candor\nabout a matter of potential security significance such as illegal drug use. It is difficult to\nsee what Applicant would have had to gain by omitting at most five uses of marijuana,\ngiven he had disclosed marijuana use to \u201cpresent\u201d on his e-QIP. The security concerns\nin AG \u00b6 16(a), \u201cdeliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from\nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used\nto conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or\nstatus, determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary\nresponsibilities,\u201d are only minimally established. \nThe investigator\u2019s report substantiates a good-faith effort by Applicant to correct\nthe record to reflect more accurately the extent of his drug abuse (\u201cthe subject realized\nduring the PRSI that it was best to tell the truth and be honest\u201d). Applicant\u2019s admission\nto drug use on the order of up to ten times versus the five originally reported was\nsufficiently timely (within weeks of his e-QIP and at his first opportunity), and voluntary,\nto apply mitigating condition AG \u00b6 17(a), \u201cthe individual made prompt, good-faith efforts\nto correct the omission, concealment, or falsification before being confronted with the\nfacts.\u201d \nApplicant\u2019s present denials of any intentional concealment are not fatal to\nhis case in mitigation when he has been the sole source of the information about his\ndrug use relied on by the government, and he brought the information forward. \n\n10\nWhole-Person Concept\nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative process factors listed\nat AG \u00b6 2(a):\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nApplicant\u2019s use of marijuana is attributed to his immaturity and to peer influences.\nHe has not used marijuana since shortly after graduating from college and beginning his\nprofessional career. Despite his relative youth, he realizes that illicit substance\ninvolvement is incompatible with his defense contractor employment and he is not likely\nto jeopardize his position by resuming involvement with illicit substances. \nWhatever concerns Applicant had about his employment, they did not prevent\nhim from candidly disclosing what was then very recent involvement with marijuana\nwhen he completed his e-QIP. He provided as accurate an accounting of his drug use\nas he could recall during his subject interview, and the government presented no\nevidence to indicate more extensive abuse. Applicant\u2019s employment evaluations show a\nlevel of performance and maturity on the job consistent with the good judgment,\nreliability, and trustworthiness that must be required of those persons with access. On\nbalance, the drug involvement and personal conduct concerns are safely in the past and\nare not likely to recur.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline H:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\n\n11\nParagraph 2, Guideline E:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.\nELIZABETH M. MATCHINSKI\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Coacher, Esquire, Department Counsel \n \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n \n \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \nO\u2019BRIEN, Rita C., Administrative Judge: \n \nBased on a review of the case file, pleadings, and exhibits, I conclude that \nApplicant has not mitigated the security concerns raised under the guideline for financial \nconsiderations. Accordingly, his request for a security clearance is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-\nQIP), signed on September 25, 2008, to request a security clearance required as part of \nhis employment with a defense contractor (Item 4). After reviewing the results of the \nensuing background investigation, adjudicators for the Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals (DOHA) were unable to make a preliminary affirmative finding1 that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s request.  \n \n1 \n \n \n                                                          \n \n \n1 Required by Executive Order 10865, as amended, and by DoD Directive 5220.6 (Directive), as \namended. \nFebruary 22, 2010\n\n \n2 \n \n \nOn September 17, 2009, DOHA issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons \n(SOR) that specified the basis for its decision: security concerns addressed in the \nDirective under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of the Revised Adjudicative \nGuidelines (AG). \n \nApplicant received the SOR on September 25, 2009. He signed a notarized \nAnswer on October 6, 2009, and requested a decision without a hearing. In his Answer, \nApplicant admitted all allegations in the SOR, except allegation 1.d. and 1.e. He also \nadmitted allegation 1.j., with explanation. On November 24, 2009, DOHA Department \nCounsel submitted a file of relevant materials (FORM) in support of the government\u2019s \npreliminary decision to deny Applicant's request to be granted a security clearance. The \nFORM contained nine documents, identified as Items 1 through 9. The FORM and \nattached Items were forwarded on November 30, 2009, and received by Applicant on \nDecember 10, 2009. He was given 30 days from the date he received the FORM to \nrespond. He did not submit a response. The case was assigned to me on February 4, \n2010, for an administrative decision based on the written record. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions in response to the SOR are incorporated herein as \nfindings of fact. After a thorough review of the pleadings, the FORM, and Applicant\u2019s \nresponse to the SOR, I make the following additional factual findings. \n \n \nApplicant is 59 years old. He has been self-employed since 1985. In 2008, he \nbegan working on a part-time basis for a federal contractor as a graphic designer. As of \nMay 2009, he worked from 20 to 40 hours per week. Since 2004, he has operated a \ndrug and alcohol recovery center, which currently  is located in his residence. (Items 4, \n5) \n \n \nApplicant married for the first time when he was 19 years old. He divorced his \nfirst wife approximately three years later. He married again in 1988 and divorced in \n2002. In 2005, Applicant married his third wife. He has three children aged 2, 4, and 22 \nyears. He and his wife separated in 2008. They share joint custody of the children. \n(Items 4, 5) \n \n \nThe SOR alleges the following 10 debts, which total $226,000 (Items 7, 8, 9).  \n \nTax Liens:   \n \n \nState tax lien of $23,062 (allegation 1.a.); \n \n \nFederal lien of $100,000 (allegation 1.j.) \n \nWithout noting which lien he was referring to, Applicant stated that he filed an \nextension in 2008, but could not afford to continue with the process (Item 6). He \nadmits poor money management, resulting in his failure to keep up with his tax \n\n \n3 \n \n \nfilings. The theft of $60,000 from his business made it difficult to pay his taxes. \nHe made some payments to the IRS, but as of January 2009, he had not made \nany payments within the previous year. He intended at that time to have an \naccountant file federal and state tax returns in July 2009. In his October 2009 \nAnswer to the SOR, he did not state whether he had filed the tax returns, and \nstated that he is not making payments. (Items 3, 5, 6) \n \nTelecommunications: one debt totaling $69,430 (allegation 1.b. [judgment]) The \ndebt is for advertising Applicant's business. As of November 2008, Applicant \nplanned to continue making payments until he is able to negotiate a settlement \namount. However, In October 2009, Applicant stated that the settlement amount \nthe creditor demanded was not possible because he does not have the funds. \n(Items 3, 5, 6) \n \nCredit card: $4,205 (allegation 1.c.) Applicant\u2019s original plan was to pay this debt \nwith equity from his house when the real estate market improves. The creditor \nhas offered settlements in the past, but Applicant did not have the funds to pay \nthe amount offered. (Items 5, 6) \n \nUnidentified creditor: $29 (allegation 1.i.) Applicant will pay the debt, and stated \nthat he might already have done so. (Item 3)  \n \nUtilities: $248 (allegations 1.e.) Applicant does not recognize this debt and \ndenies having service from this company. (Item 6) \n \nVending company: $28,617 (allegation 1.f.) This debt relates to a lease \nApplicant signed while running his business. He negotiated with the creditor, but \ndid not have the funds to pay the debt because of the failure of his business. The \ncreditor filed suit in April 2009, in an effort to seize various assets. Applicant \nstates that the judge did not allow seizure of the assets. As to the debt, he notes \nthat \u201csome day I will pay it.\u201d (Items 3, 5, 6) \n \nMedical:  \n \n$105 \u2013 unknown medical provider (allegation 1.d.) \u2013 In his interrogatory \nresponse, Applicant was unsure of the creditor for this debt. However, in \nhis Answer, he denied the debt, because he stated that he \u201cpaid it off; I \nhave not cleaned it up yet.\u201d He provided no documentation to support this \nclaim. (Item 6) \n \n$164 \u2013 medical center (allegation 1.g.) - Applicant admits to owing this \ndebt and intends to pay it. (Item 3) \n \n$2,417 \u2013 unknown medical provider (allegation 1.h. [judgment]) - Applicant \ndoes not recognize this debt. If it is valid, he intends to pay it. (Item 3) \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \n                                                          \n \nIn response to the FORM, Applicant failed to provide documentation to support \nhis statement that he paid allegation 1.d., that he has \u201cpaid them several times over\u201d as \nto allegation 1.c., or that he \u201cprobably\u201d already has paid the $29 debt at allegation 1.i. \nHe stated that he would pay the remaining debts when he could.2 \n. \nApplicant submitted a personal financial statement indicating a net monthly \nincome of $1,200, and additional income of $10,000 from the recovery center he \noperates, for a total of $11,200. He listed monthly expenses of $9,900 and debt \npayments of $6,900, for a total monthly outlay of $16,800. These figures result in a \nnegative monthly net remainder of $5,600. Applicant did not include payments of SOR \ndebts on this expense sheet. (Item 6) \n \nFor 25 years, Applicant operated his own business. In about 2003, he hired an \naccountant who stole more than $60,000. In addition, Applicant billed approximately \n$200,000 per year with a large defense contractor. The contractor\u2019s account manager, \nwho had referred jobs to Applicant, left that company, and thereafter Applicant no longer \nreceived assignments from the contractor client. He did not indicate when this event \noccurred. However, these two events severely damaged his business, and he has been \nstruggling financially since that time. (Items 3, 5) \n \nIn 2006, Applicant adjusted to these changes by moving to an area with a lower \ncost of living. He purchased a foreclosed home, intending to repair it and later use the \nequity to pay debts and improve his credit. The house value has increased from the \npurchase price of $850,000 to an appraised value of $1.25 million in January 2009. He \nalso uses his residence as an alcohol and drug addiction recovery center, which \nimproved his cash flow. Applicant believes that he is in a solid financial position and \nstated, \u201cMy credit is depleted, but the equity I need to pay off my debts is here in my \nhome. My plan worked and I will make people whole some day when I can.\u201d He also \nstated, \u201cI will pay my debts and will have a prudent reserve some day as a result of \ninvesting in my home. The equity is there, stuck for now, but is existent.\u201d (Items 3, 5) \n \nApplicant has also had family difficulties in the past several years. He supported \nhis terminally ill sister for the last two years of her life. Her care prevented him from \nmaintaining his usual income level from his business. He also spent time and resources \nhelping his brother, who died about the same time as his sister. (Item 3) \n \nApplicant did not state whether he has participated in financial counseling. He \nnoted in his Answer that he chose not to pursue bankruptcy, which is a legitimate path \nthat an applicant can consider to resolve overwhelming debt. Other than his own \nstatements, he did not provide character references, performance evaluations, or other \ndocuments on which to base an assessment of his character. As Applicant chose to \nhave his case decided on the basis of the written record, it is difficult to assess his \ncredibility. \n \n \n2 As of May 2009, Applicant also owed approximately $4,000 in loans from three friends. These debts are \nnot alleged in the SOR. \n\n \n5 \n \n \n                                                          \nPolicies \n \nEach security clearance decision must be a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndetermination based on examination of all available relevant and material information, \nand consideration of the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in the Revised \nAdjudicative Guidelines (AG).3 Decisions must also reflect consideration of the factors \nlisted in \u00b6 2(a) of the Guidelines, commonly referred to as the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept.  \nThe presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not determinative \nof a conclusion for or against an applicant. However, specific applicable guidelines \nshould be followed whenever a case can be measured against them as they represent \npolicy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to classified information. In this \ncase, the pleadings and the information presented by the parties require consideration \nof the security concerns and adjudicative factors addressed under Guideline F \n(Financial Considerations). \n \nA security clearance decision is intended only to resolve whether it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest4 for an applicant to either receive or continue to \nhave access to classified information. The government bears the initial burden of \nproducing admissible information on which it based the preliminary decision to deny or \nrevoke a security clearance for an applicant. Additionally, the government must be able \nto prove controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If the government meets its burden, it \nthen falls to the applicant to refute, extenuate or mitigate the government\u2019s case.  \n \nBecause no one has a \u201cright\u201d to a security clearance, an applicant bears a heavy \nburden of persuasion.5 A person who has access to classified information enters into a \nfiduciary relationship with the government based on trust and confidence. Therefore, the  \ngovernment has a compelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the \nrequisite judgment, reliability and trustworthiness of one who will protect the national \ninterests as his or his own. The \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard \ncompels resolution of any reasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in \nfavor of the government.6 \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nAG \u00b618 expresses the security concern pertaining to financial considerations: \n \n \n3 Directive. 6.3. \n \n4 See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988). \n \n5 See Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, 531. \n \n6 See Egan; Revised Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 2(b). \n\n \n6 \n \n \nFailure or inability to live within one's means, satisfy debts, \nand meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, \nlack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and \nregulations, all of which can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. An individual who is financially over-\nextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to \ngenerate funds. Compulsive gambling is a concern as it may \nlead to financial crimes including espionage. Affluence that \ncannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern. It may indicate proceeds from financially \nprofitable criminal acts. \n \n \nThe record evidence shows that Applicant\u2019s unpaid debts of approximately \n$226,000 remain unpaid. In addition, he failed to file state and federal tax returns and \ntax liens have been placed against him. The federal lien alone amounts to $100,000. \nApplicant's history of failing to meet his financial obligations supports application of \ndisqualifying conditions AG \u00b619 (a) (inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts), AG \u00b619 \n(c) (a history of not meeting financial obligations) and AG \u00b6 19(g) (failure to file annual \nfederal, state, or local income tax returns as required or the fraudulent filing of the \nsame) apply.  \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 20, the following potentially mitigating conditions are relevant:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under \nsuch circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the \nperson's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected \nmedical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual acted \nresponsibly under the circumstances;  \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or \nthere are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control;  \nand \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts. \n \n \nAs of the date the SOR was issued, Applicant had more than $200,000 in \ndelinquent debt. His financial problems are not in the distant past, because these debts \nremain unpaid. He intends to use his home equity to pay his debts, but has no \nimmediate plan to access that equity. Moreover, with his large negative monthly \nremainder, it cannot be predicted when his situation will be resolved, or that new \ndelinquencies will not occur in the future. AG \u00b6 20(a) cannot be applied. \n\n \n7 \n \n \n                                                          \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b) is relevant because Applicant\u2019s business suffered two events that \nseverely damaged it: the theft of assets by an accountant, and the loss of business from \nApplicant's largest client. These were events that he could not have predicted. However, \nwithout knowing the dates of these events, it is difficult to determine when they occurred \nin relation to when his debts became delinquent. Applicant earns a limited income from \npart-time employment. It appears from his personal financial statement that he does not \nearn substantial income from the residential center. Applicant's limited income \ncontributes to the difficulty in bringing his debts under control. Applicant's relocation, his \nhome purchase, and the increase in the house\u2019s value are positive signs. However, his \nlong-range plan to use the equity in his home to pay down his debts is a future plan, \nwhich may or may not be realized. He has taken no other steps toward resolving his \ndebt. Only partial mitigation is available under AG \u00b6 20(b). \n \n \nIt does not appear from the record that Applicant received financial counseling to \nassist him in developing a budget, establishing payment plans, or resolving his debts. \nAG \u00b6 20(c) cannot be applied.  \n \n \nApplicant has provided no documentation supporting his statement that he made \nsome payments on the telecommunications debt. He has no payment plans in place. \nThere is no evidence indicating that Applicant's debts are in the process of being \nresolved. There is no evidence that he has attempted to tap into his current equity by \nobtaining a home equity loan. The Appeal Board defines \u201cgood-faith\u201c as acting in a way \nthat shows reasonableness, prudence, honesty and adherence to duty or obligation.7 \nPromises to act in the future are insufficient to constitute good-faith efforts. Although an \napplicant is not required to have paid every debt, he or she must show a reasonable \nplan for repayment and actions to support the plan. Although Applicant plans to some \nday use his equity to pay his debts, he gives no indication of when that will be, and has \ntaken no steps to implement the plan. AG \u00b6 20(d) does not apply. Overall, the partial \nmitigation available under AG \u00b6 20(b) is insufficient to outweigh the fact that Applicant \ncarries a very large debt load and has taken no steps to resolve it. I find against the \nApplicant on Guideline F. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s security eligibility by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all \nthe circumstances. I have evaluated the facts presented and have applied the \nappropriate adjudicative factors under the cited Guideline. I have also reviewed the \nrecord before me in the context of the whole-person factors listed in AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \n \n7 ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2004). \n\n \n8 \n \n \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nApplicant is 59 years old. His income decreased when his business suffered \nsubstantial losses from theft by an employee and the departure of his major client. \nThese factors, as well as his admitted mismanagement of his finances, contributed to \nthe significant debt load of more than $200,000 that he accrued over the past several \nyears. Although he states that he will some day pay his creditors with the equity in his \nhome, there is no evidence of a concrete plan to do so, nor any steps taken in that \ndirection.

The record evidence\nshows Applicant has a history of financial problems, which is ongoing and not under\ncontrol. There is insufficient evidence to explain, extenuate, or mitigate the security\nconcerns stemming from his history of financial problems. Accordingly, as explained in\nfurther detail below, this case is decided against Applicant.\nJune 22, 2010\n\n  This case is adjudicated under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry,\n1\nsigned by President Eisenhower on February 20, 1960, as amended, as well as DoD Directive 5220.6,\nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program, dated January 2, 1992, as amended\n(Directive). In addition, the Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified\nInformation (AG), effective within the Defense Department on September 1, 2006, apply to this case.  The AG\nwere published in the Federal Register and codified in 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 154, Appendix H (2006). The AG replace\nthe guidelines in Enclosure 2 to the Directive.   \n2\nStatement of the Case\nActing under the relevant Executive Order and DoD Directive,  on October 1,\n1\n2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (the Agency) issued a statement of\nreasons (SOR) explaining it was unable to find it is clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant Applicant access to classified information. The SOR is similar to a\ncomplaint, and it detailed the factual basis for the action under the security guideline\nknown as Guideline F for financial considerations. The SOR also recommended that the\ncase be submitted to an administrative judge to decide whether to deny or revoke\nApplicant\u2019s security clearance.  \nApplicant answered the SOR in a timely fashion and requested a hearing. The\ncase was assigned to me December 3, 2009. The hearing took place February 2, 2010.\nThe hearing transcript (Tr.) was received February 16, 2010. \nThe record was kept open until March 1, 2010, to allow Applicant to submit\nadditional documentary evidence. His post-hearing submission was a bit haphazard (it\nwas initially misdirected and submitted piecemeal in two major parts). It also contains\nduplications, which were removed and placed in the blue correspondence folder of the\ncase file along with Department Counsel\u2019s cover letters describing Applicant\u2019s\nsubmissions. In addition to Applicant\u2019s Exhibits A and B admitted at hearing, the\nfollowing post-hearing documents are admitted without objections:\n\u2022\nExhibit C\u2013Applicant\u2019s cover letter, dated March 6, 2010;\n\u2022\nExhibit D\u2013Correspondence from consumer law firm, dated February 5, 2010;\n\u2022\nExhibit E\u2013One page of a credit report, dated March 6, 2010, showing disputes;\n\u2022\nExhibit F\u2013Applicant\u2019s military retiree account statement, dated December 2009;\n\u2022\nExhibit G\u2013Letter of reference, dated February 16, 2010;\n\u2022\nExhibit H\u2013Letter of reference, undated;\n\u2022\nExhibit I\u2013Account statement from AAFES, dated February 2, 2010;\n\u2022\nExhibit J\u2013Paid-in-full letter, dated February 22, 2010;\n\u2022\nExhibit K\u2013Paid-in-full letter, dated May 26, 2008;\n\u2022\nExhibit L\u2013Form 1099-R for Applicant\u2019s 2009 military retirement pay;\n\u2022\nExhibit M\u2013Bank account statement, dated February 11, 2010;\n\u2022\nExhibit N\u2013Bank credit line statement, dated January 27, 2010; and\n\u2022\nExhibit O\u2013Copy of money order, dated February 15, 2010.\n \n\n Exhibit F. \n2\n Exhibit L. \n3\n Tr. 70. \n4\n Tr. 47\u201348.\n5\n Exhibits 1\u20137. \n6\n3\nFindings of Fact\nBased on the record evidence as a whole, the following facts are established by\nsubstantial evidence.\nApplicant is a 52-year-old employee of a federal contractor. He is seeking to\nobtain a security clearance, although he held one in the past. He married in 1982 and\ndivorced in 2004. He and his wife reconciled within months of divorce and have since\nlived together unmarried. There are no minor children in his household. \nApplicant\u2019s employment history includes more than 20 years of honorable military\nservice in the U.S. Army, which ended with his retirement in 1998. He retired as a senior\nnoncommissioned officer (pay grade E-7), and he receives taxable retired pay of $1,448\nmonthly;  he received taxable retired pay of $17,379 in 2009.\n2\n3\nAfter retiring from the military, Applicant\u2019s employment history has been sporadic,\nto include periods of unemployment and underemployment. He worked for a series of\ncontractors from May 1998 to April 2001. He was then underemployed as a cashier for\nabout a year. He was unemployed from April 2002 to April 2004. He was then\nunderemployed as a school custodian from April 2004 to July 2006, when he was\nunemployed again until November 2006. He then worked a series of jobs as a shuttle\ndriver and security officer from November 2006 to May 2008. He began his current\nemployment as a instructor for a defense contractor in May 2008. He reports an annual\nincome of $59,000 for this job.\n  \nApplicant has a history of financial problems, which he does not dispute, for the\nlast ten years.  He attributes his financial problems to two main causes. First, he points\n4\nto his then spouse who neglected bill-paying responsibilities when he was working\noverseas. He returned from overseas in about 2000,  and he then learned his wife had\n5\nspent money on other matters. This circumstance led to their divorce. Second, Applicant\nwent through a period of heavy drinking (e.g., as much as a pint of vodka daily) that\nresulted in financial problems as well. Applicant is now sober, and he has been so since\nabout November 2006. \nThe SOR alleges 12 delinquent debts with various creditors for a total of about\n$16,000, and his debts are established by the evidence.  One of the debts in an unpaid\n6\njudgment, several are medical debts in collection, and the others are consumer debts.\n\n Exhibit B at 2 of 7. \n7\n Exhibits  J and O.\n8\n Exhibit K\n9\n Exhibit E. \n10\n Exhibits F and I. \n11\n Exhibit N. \n12\n Tr. 83. \n13\n Exhibit M. \n14\n Exhibit A. \n15\n Tr. 81. \n16\n Exhibit B. \n17\n4\nIn his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted all the debts except for six that he claimed\nwere paid. As far as can be determined, he did not present documentary proof-of-\npayment for any of the debts in the SOR. \nApplicant presented documentary proof-of-payment for debts not in the SOR as\nfollows: (1) a $71 medical collection account;  (2) a credit account placed for collection;\n7\n8\nand (3) a wireless account placed for collection.  In addition, he presented documentary\n9\nproof of the following: (1) he is disputing two accounts;  he is making $171 monthly\n10\npayments on a government debt (AAFES) via involuntary deduction from his military\nretiree pay;  and he is making payments on a bank credit line (similar to a credit\n11\ncard).12\nApplicant has little money in the bank, had but $5 in savings, and is living\npaycheck-to-paycheck.  His bank account statement confirms these circumstances, as\n13\nit shows an account balance of $107 as of February 11, 2010.  The statement also\n14\nshows year-to-date overdraft fees of $32. Moreover, according to his budget, he spends\n$490 monthly on cigarettes and alcohol.  He denies drinking alcohol, and he explained\n15\nthat his now ex-wife mistakenly wrote alcohol on the document.16\nThe best evidence of Applicant\u2019s financial situation is likely a September 2009\ncredit report presented by Applicant.  In addition to the unpaid judgment for $673, the\n17\ncredit report reflects 11 adverse accounts, one of which was a past-due installment\nloan, and one of which is a paid $71 medical collection account. The other nine\ncollection or charged-off accounts have a combined balance of about $4,293, for a total\nof $4,966 when added to the unpaid judgment. The installment loan is noteworthy\nbecause the credit report shows Applicant obtained the loan to buy a vehicle for about\n$26,000 in November 2007. The term of the loan is for 72 months with a monthly\n\n Exhibit D. \n18\n Exhibits G and H. \n19\n Department of Navy v.

Department of Defense, 275 F.3d 988, 994 (10  Cir. 2002) (no right to a\nth\nsecurity clearance).\n 484 U.S. at 531.\n21\n Directive, \u00b6 3.2. \n22\n Directive, \u00b6 3.2. \n23\n ISCR Case No. 02-18663 (App. Bd.

Both individuals vouch for Applicant and recommend him for a\n19\nsecurity clearance.  \n \nPolicies\nThis section sets forth the general principles of law and policies that apply to an\nindustrial security clearance case. To start, the only purpose of a clearance decision is\nto decide if an applicant is suitable for access to classified information.\nIt is well-established law that no one has a right to a security clearance.  As\n20\nnoted by the Supreme Court in the case of Department of Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe clearly\nconsistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they\nmust, on the side of denials.\u201d  Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive,\n21\nany doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified\ninformation will be resolved in favor of protecting national security.  \nA favorable clearance decision establishes eligibility of an applicant to be granted\na security clearance for access to confidential, secret, or top-secret information.  An\n22\nunfavorable decision (1) denies any application, (2) revokes any existing security\nclearance, and (3) prevents access to classified information at any level.  \n23\nThere is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for\naccess to classified information.  The Government has the burden of presenting\n24\n\n Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.14.\n25\n Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n26\n Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n27\n Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n28\n ISCR Case No. 01-20700 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002) (citations omitted).\n29\n Executive Order 10865, \u00a7 7.\n30\n AG \u00b6\u00b6 18, 19, and 20 (setting forth the security concern and the disqualifying and mitigating conditions). \n31\n6\nevidence to establish facts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted.  An\n25\napplicant is responsible for presenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate\nfacts that have been admitted or proven.  In addition, an applicant has the ultimate\n26\nburden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.  In Egan, the Supreme\n27\nCourt stated that the burden of proof is less than a preponderance of the evidence.28\nThe DOHA Appeal Board has followed the Court\u2019s reasoning, and a judge\u2019s findings of\nfact are reviewed under the substantial-evidence standard.29\nThe Adjudicative Guidelines set forth the relevant standards to consider when\nevaluating a person\u2019s security clearance eligibility, including disqualifying conditions\n(DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) for each guideline. In addition, each clearance\ndecision must be a commonsense decision based upon consideration of all the relevant\nand material information, the pertinent criteria and adjudication factors, and the whole-\nperson concept. \nA person granted access to classified information enters into a special\nrelationship with the Government. The Government must be able to have a high degree\nof trust and confidence in those persons to whom it grants access to classified\ninformation. The decision to deny a person a security clearance is not a determination\nof an applicant\u2019s loyalty.  Instead, it is a determination that an applicant has not met the\n30\nstrict guidelines the President has established for granting eligibility for access.\nAnalysis\nUnder Guideline F for financial considerations,  the suitability of an applicant\n31\nmay be questioned or put into doubt when that applicant has a history of excessive\nindebtedness, financial problems or difficulties, or financial irresponsibility. A security\nconcern typically exists due to significant unpaid debts. The overall concern under\nGuideline F is that: \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\n\n AG \u00b6 18.  \n32\n AG \u00b6 19(a).  \n33\n AG \u00b6 19(c). \n34\n AG \u00b6 19(f). \n35\n AG \u00b6 20 (a) \u2013 (f) (setting forth six mitigating conditions). \n36\n7\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to\nprotect classified information.  \n32\nSimilarly, an individual who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible,\nunconcerned, negligent, or careless in properly handling and safeguarding classified\ninformation.   \nThe record here supports a conclusion that Applicant has a history of financial\nproblems or difficulties. This history raises concerns because it indicates inability or\nunwillingness to satisfy debts  and a history of not meeting financial obligations  within\n33\n34\nthe meaning of Guideline F. The facts are sufficient to establish these two disqualifying\nconditions. In addition, a third disqualifying condition applies because the evidence\nshows his financial problems were linked to his alcoholism, although he has been sober\nsince late 2006.35\nUnder Guideline F, there are six conditions that may mitigate security concerns:36\n(a) The behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred\nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast\ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment;\n(b) The conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely\nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business\ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or\nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;\n(c) The person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is\nunder control;\n(d) The individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or\notherwise resolve debts;\n(e) The individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the\npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides\n\n AG \u00b6 2(a)(1) \u2013 (9).\n37\n8\ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides\nevidence of actions to resolve the issue; and \n(f) The affluence resulted from a legal source of income.\nThe most pertinent here are subparagraphs (b) and (d) based on Applicant\u2019s\ndivorce, the periods of unemployment and underemployment, and his efforts to repay.\nBut the credit in mitigation is insufficient to overcome the security concerns. The\nevidence shows Applicant has done little to repay, settle, or otherwise resolve the debts\nat issue in the SOR. Given his longstanding history of indebtedness, his decision to take\non a $563 monthly car payment in late 2007 is inexplicable.  The evidence also shows\nthat his financial problems are ongoing and likely to continue. He does not have firm\ncontrol or a comprehensive knowledge of his indebtedness. He has not established a\ntrack record of repayment that could be used to measure the likelihood that he will\nsuccessfully resolve his indebtedness in the near future. Although Applicant is sincere\nand genuinely wants to take care of his delinquent debts, the record is insufficient to\nmake any safe predictive judgments that Applicant will put his financial house in good\norder anytime soon.     \nTo conclude, the facts and circumstances surrounding Applicant\u2019s ongoing\nfinancial problems justify current doubts about his judgment, reliability, and\ntrustworthiness. Following Egan and the clearly-consistent standard, these doubts are\nresolved in favor of protecting national security. In reaching this conclusion, I gave due\nconsideration to the whole-person concept  and Applicant\u2019s favorable evidence.\n37\nNevertheless, Applicant did not meet his ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a\nfavorable clearance decision. This case is decided against Applicant. \nFormal Findings\nThe formal findings on the SOR allegations are as follows:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.a\u20131.l:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of the record as a whole, it is not clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance.

Mendez, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nMETZ, John Grattan, Jr., Administrative Judge:\nBased on the record in this case,  Applicant\u2019s clearance is denied.\n1\nOn 8 March 2010, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under Guidelines\nF (Financial Considerations), C (Foreign Preference), B (Foreign Influence), and E\n(Personal Conduct).  Applicant timely answered, and requested a hearing. DOHA\n2\nassigned the case to me 14 July 2010, and I convened a hearing 17 August 2010.\nDOHA received the transcript (Tr.) 24 August 2010.\nMarch 31, 2011\n\n2\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant admitted SOR allegations 1.a, 1.b, 1.c, 3.a, 3.b, 3.c, 3.d, 3.e, 3.f, 4.b,\nand 4.c. He denied allegations 1.d, 1.e, 2.a, and 4.a. He is a 57-year-old security officer\nemployed by a defense contractor since October 2007. However, he has been\nemployed as a security officer, sometimes working for two employers, since February\n2003. It appears he was unemployed for many years before January 2001. He has not\npreviously held a clearance.\nApplicant was born in Liberia in June 1953. He grew up there, married, and\nraised a family. In the early 1990s, Applicant held three senior government positions by\nappointment of the Liberian president. As a consequence of these positions, Applicant\nheld a Liberian diplomatic passport.\nIn 1992, after receiving death threats during a time of political turmoil in Liberia,\nApplicant fled Liberia for the U.S. where he petitioned for, and obtained, asylum. In\n1995, he obtained asylum for his wife and his minor children. He became a naturalized\nU.S. citizen in November 2007. He obtained his first U.S. passport in October 2008.\nApplicant\u2019s Liberian diplomatic passport had an original expiration date of July\n1992. However, for reasons that do not appear in the record, the Liberian embassy\nextended the validity of the passport for three years in February 1993, for another three\nyears in February 1997, and for an additional year in September 2003.\nApplicant\u2019s adult son and daughter and two half brothers are resident citizens of\nLiberia. None of them have any connection to the Liberian government. Applicant has\nregular contact with his children; he has very little contact with his half brothers.\nApplicant\u2019s wife is a Liberian citizen, and legally resident in the U.S. Her U.S. citizenship\napplication is pending.\nApplicant is founder and bishop of a church he established in January 2001. The\nchurch maintains buildings in the U.S. and in Liberia. Applicant also owns a partially-\ncompleted home in Liberia valued at $80,000\u2013125,000. Applicant stays there when he\nis in Liberia, and he also uses it as lodging for visiting clergymen to spare them the hotel\nexpense. Applicant traveled to Liberia in 2002 and 2008, both times related to his\nchurch.\nOn Applicant\u2019s April 2008 clearance application (GE 1), he failed to disclose his\nemployments with the Liberian government. Despite the clear language of the question\nasking him if he had ever been employed by a foreign government, Applicant claimed\nhe did not disclose the employments because he no longer held them. Applicant\ndisclosed that he had held a foreign passport, but failed to disclose that it was a\ndiplomatic passport and falsely claimed that he surrendered it to U.S. immigration\nofficials when he became a U.S. citizen. Applicant disclosed he had owned a home in\nLiberia but (not alleged as a falsification in the SOR) did not disclose that he still owned\nthe home. Indeed, his clearance application suggested he had not owned the home\n\n3\nsince 1992. During a January 2009 interview with a government investigator about his\nclearance, Applicant claimed he surrendered his Liberian passport to the State\nDepartment when he got his U.S. passport in October 2008. Instead, he submitted his\npassport as part of the documentation to get his U.S. passport. The Liberian passport\nwas returned to him in due course, and Applicant still has it, although it has again\nexpired.\nThe SOR alleges, and government exhibits confirm, five delinquent debts totaling\nover $21,000. Applicant denies two debts totaling less than $200. He admits the rest.\nApplicant cites no particular causes for his indebtedness, other than a condition inherent\nin being a security officer, of not being scheduled for enough hours, even when working\ntwo jobs. The single biggest debt (SOR 1.a) is for a credit card that Applicant has used\nto pay church expenses. That debt has now grown to over $18,000. In 2009, the\ncreditor offered to settle the debt for $9,000, paid in three equal monthly payments, but\nApplicant lacked the funds to take advantage of the offer (GE 4).\nApplicant claims, without corroboration, to have reached repayment plans with\nsome of his creditors. He documented one $100 payment to the creditor at 1.b, but\nacknowledges (Tr. 49) that he only makes occasional payments. He claimed, without\ncorroboration, to have agreed to make eight monthly payments of $400 to the creditor at\n1.b, but he also lacks the funds to make that payment.\nPolicies\nThe adjudicative guidelines (AG) list factors to evaluate a person\u2019s suitability for\naccess to classified information. Administrative judges must assess disqualifying and\nmitigating conditions under each issue fairly raised by the facts and situation presented.\nEach decision must also show a fair, impartial, and commonsense consideration of the\nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2(a). The applicability of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is\nnot, by itself, conclusive. However, specific guidelines should be followed when a case\ncan be measured against them, as they are policy guidance governing the grant or\ndenial of a clearance. Considering the SOR allegations and the evidence as a whole,\nthe relevant adjudicative guidelines are Guideline F (Financial Considerations),\nGuideline C (Foreign Preference), Guideline B (Foreign Influence), and Guideline E\n(Personal Conduct).\nSecurity clearance decisions resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s security clearance. The Government\nmust prove, by substantial evidence, disputed facts alleged in the SOR. If it does, the\nburden shifts to applicant to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the Government\u2019s case.\nBecause no one has a right to a security clearance, the applicant bears a heavy burden\nof persuasion.\nPersons with access to classified information enter into a fiduciary relationship\nwith the Government based on trust and confidence. Therefore, the Government has a\ncompelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the required judgment,\n\nSee, Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988).\n3\n\u00b6 19.(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; (c) a history of not meeting financial obligations;\n4\n\u00b6 20 (a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that\n5\nit is  unlikely to recur . . . \n\u00b6 20.(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control . . . and\n6\nthe individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;\n\u00b6 20.(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and there are clear indications that\n7\nthe problem is being resolved or is under control;\n\u00b6 20.(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.\n8\n\u00b6 10(a) exercise of any right, privilege, or obligation of foreign citizenship after becoming a U.S. citizen or\n9\nthrough the foreign citizenship of a family member. This included but is not limited to: (1) possession of a\ncurrent foreign passport; (b) action to acquire or obtain recognition of a foreign citizenship by an American\ncitizen;\n4\nreliability, and trustworthiness of those who must protect national interests as their own.\nThe \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels deciding any\nreasonable doubt about an Applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the Government.3\nAnalysis\nThe Government established a case for disqualification under Guideline F, and\nApplicant did not mitigate the security concerns. Applicant\u2019s financial problems seem to\nbe almost an inevitable consequence of his employment as a security officer and the\ninconsistent working hours available to him. Applicant has had financial problems for\nseveral years, and it seems he has little prospect for increased earnings that would\nallow him to meet his financial obligations.4\nApplicant meets none of the mitigating factors for financial considerations. His\nfinancial difficulties are both recent and multiple.  He produced no evidence of\n5\ncircumstances beyond his control, and he has not acted responsibly in addressing his\ndebts.  He has received no credit or financial counseling, nor has he demonstrated that\n6\nhis financial problems are under control, or that he has a plan to bring them under\ncontrol.  He has not made a good-faith effort to satisfy his debts.  I conclude Guideline F\n7\n8\nagainst Applicant.\nThe government did not establish a case for disqualification under Guideline C.9\nUnder U.S. immigration law, a legal permanent resident is required to maintain a valid\nforeign passport. It is not actually clear from the record that Applicant met this\nrequirement, but there is no evidence that his foreign passport was valid after he\nobtained his U.S. citizenship, and he did not renew the passport after getting his U.S.\ncitizenship. Further, none of the conduct alleged by the Government as evidence of dual\ncitizenship, except for passive ownership of property in Liberia, occurred after Applicant\n\n\u00b6 11(c) exercise of the rights, privileges, or obligations of foreign citizenship occurred before the individual\n10\nbecame a U.S. citizen or when the individual was a minor;\n\u00b6 6.\n11\n\u00b6 7 (a).\n12\n5\nbecame a U.S. citizen.  There is no evidence that Applicant is required to be a Liberian\n10\ncitizen to continue to own property there. None of the conduct cited by the Government\nsuggests that Applicant has a preference for Liberia over the U.S. I resolve Guideline C\nfor Applicant.\nThe Government established a case for disqualification under Guideline B, and\nApplicant only mitigated some of the security concerns. Under Guideline B (Foreign\nInfluence), an applicant\u2019s foreign contacts and interests may raise security concerns if\nthe individual 1) has divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, 2) may be\nmanipulated or induced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in\na way contrary to U.S. interests, or 3) is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by any\nforeign interest. Foreign influence adjudications can and should consider the identity of\nthe foreign country in which the foreign contact or financial interest is\nlocated\u2014including, but not limited to, whether the country is known to target U.S.\ncitizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a risk of terrorism.11\nEvaluation of an individual\u2019s qualifications for access to protected information requires\ncareful assessment of both the foreign entity\u2019s willingness and ability to target protected\ninformation, and to target expatriates who are U.S. citizens to obtain that information,\nand the individual\u2019s susceptibility to influence, whether negative or positive. More\nspecifically, an individual\u2019s contacts with foreign family members (or other foreign\nentities or persons) raise security concerns only if those contacts create a heightened\nrisk or foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion.12\nIn this case, the argument for disqualification under Guideline B is not persuasive\nregarding the citizenship of his spouse who resides in the U.S. as a legal permanent\nresident, his relatives who are resident citizens of Liberia, or his nearly-20-year-old\nemployment by the Liberian government. Considering first the foreign country involved,\nthe Government raised no concerns related to the Liberian government.\nConsidering Applicant\u2019s situation in relation to the Liberian government, the\nGovernment produced no evidence that there was any risk, much less a heightened\nrisk, of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion because of\nApplicant\u2019s limited family contacts in Liberia. None of the family members is connected\nto the Liberian government, and Applicant\u2019s government service there ended nearly 20\nyears ago. Applicant\u2019s wife is a legal permanent resident of the U.S. Consequently,\nthere are no security concerns arising from these aspects of Applicant\u2019s association with\nLiberia. However, Applicant\u2019s decade-long religious ministry in Liberia, his travel to\nLiberia to further that ministry, and his maintaining his property there to further that\n\n\u00b6 16.(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant and material facts from any personnel\n13\nsecurity questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, . . . [or]\ndetermine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness. . .;\n\u00b6 17(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, concealment, or falsification\n14\nbefore being confronted with the facts;\n6\nministry shows ongoing contacts with Liberia that heighten the risk that Applicant might\nbe influenced to provide information to Liberia. I resolve Guideline B against Applicant.\nThe Government established a case for disqualification under Guideline E, and\nApplicant did not mitigate the security concerns. Applicants are expected to give full and\nfrank answers during the clearance process. Applicant\u2019s failure to disclose his past\nemployment by the Liberian government and his misrepresentation of the status of his\nLiberian diplomatic passport, both on his clearance application and during his subject\ninterview, constitute a deliberate falsification or evasiveness inconsistent with the\ncandor required of applicants.  \n13\nNone of the Guideline E mitigating conditions apply. The concealed information\nwas relevant to a clearance decision. Applicant did not disclose this adverse information\nuntil later in the clearance process.  Applicant\u2019s failure to disclose this information\n14\ndemonstrates a lack of candor required of cleared personnel. The Government has an\ninterest in examining all relevant and material adverse information about an applicant\nbefore making a clearance decision. The Government relies on applicants to truthfully\ndisclose that adverse information in a timely fashion, not when they perceive disclosure\nto be prudent or convenient. Further, an applicant\u2019s willingness to report adverse\ninformation about himself provides some indication of his willingness to report\ninadvertent security violations or other security concerns in the future, something the\nGovernment relies on to perform damage assessments and limit the compromise of\nclassified information. Applicant\u2019s conduct suggests he is willing to put his personal\nneeds ahead of legitimate Government interests. I resolve Guideline E against\nApplicant.\nA whole person analysis of the facts in this case requires no different result.\nApplicant\u2019s ongoing involvement with his religious ministry in Liberia, falsification of his\nclearance application regarding his past foreign connections to Liberia, and his\ncontinuing financial problems argue against granting Applicant\u2019s access to classified\ninformation.\nFormal Findings\nParagraph 1.

For the following reasons, the Board\naffirms the Judge\u2019s unfavorable decision. \nThe Judge made the following findings: In 1997 Applicant and his wife purchased a\nresidential home facility for senior citizens.  They purchased the business with very limited due\ndiligence examination of the records of the business and completed the purchase as individual sole\nproprietors, and not in corporate or partnership form.  Applicant claimed they produced a profit from\nthe business until 2006, although he provided no profit and loss statements or other business records\ncovering their operations.  Beginning in 2006, the operating costs of the business increased\nsubstantially.  Applicant and his wife could no longer cover their operating costs.  To make up their\noperating deficits, they used their personal and business credit cards.  By June 2007, matters had\nworsened to the point where Applicant and his wife were forced to prioritize their debts, and they\nfailed to pay their business payroll taxes as they were required to do.  They also borrowed from their\n401(k) retirement accounts.  These actions did not satisfy the arrearages and shortfalls.  In January\n2008, the building owner did not renew the lease, and Applicant and his wife abandoned the\nbusiness.  By 2010, Applicant and his wife had accumulated arrearages of $13,000 in state payroll\ntaxes, $160,000 in federal payroll taxes, $5,538 in back state personal taxes and $43,296 in back\nfederal personal taxes.  Besides their major tax accruals, Applicant and his wife accumulated almost\n$500,000 in various consumer debts.  The state of the evidence is such that their personal debts\ncannot be distinguished from their business-related debts.  Applicant and his wife filed for Chapter\n7 bankruptcy and received a discharge in September 2008.  The discharged debts included unsecured\nportions of their home mortgage and the unsecured credit card and consumer debt.  Not discharged\nwere their local property taxes and their state and federal income and payroll taxes.  In 2007 and\n2009, Applicant and his wife entered into installment agreements with their state\u2019s franchise tax\nboard to repay delinquent personal state taxes.  They completed an installment agreement with the\nIRS in 2007 to repay personal federal taxes.  They are in compliance with the state franchise tax\nboard and the IRS and currently owe a little less than $12,000 on the former and $38,236 on the\nlatter.  They still owe the IRS $160,000 and the state $13,323 in withheld state payroll taxes.  Before\nthe hearing, Applicant and his wife had not made any voluntary attempts to resolve their back\npayroll taxes.  The only tax debt that they have been able to document as paid to date is their local\nproperty tax.  In March 2010, Applicant and his wife submitted an offer in compromise to the IRS\nfor the outstanding payroll taxes.  At this time, the IRS is still processing their offer and it is\nunknown when or how they will respond to Applicant\u2019s compromise offer.  \nThe Judge reached the following conclusions: While Applicant\u2019s many unsecured personal\nand business debts were discharged in his Chapter 7 bankruptcy, his tax debts have not been\ndischarged.  Failure to escrow and remit withheld escrow taxes collected from employees represents\na serious fiduciary breach and exposes the fiduciary to potential criminal liability.  At this time,\n\n1\u201c[T]he individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts[.]\u201d\n3\nApplicant awaits acceptance of his settlement proposal from the IRS, and there is no documentation\nto resolve the state payroll taxes.  Applicant does not provide adequate explanations as to why he\nand his wife did not make earlier attempts to arrange payment with state and IRS tax authorities\nregarding the payroll taxes.  Without more financial information, it is impossible to determine what\nportion of his Chapter 7 bankruptcy debts were business related and which debts were personal ones.\nJudging from the number of refinanced mortgages Applicant and his wife completed between 1999\nand 2006 and the size of the accumulated debts they accrued before 2008, it is difficult to avoid the\nconclusion that they were making business and personal decisions that exceeded their earnings\ncapabilities.  Mitigation credit to Applicant is very limited based on the available record.  He and\nhis wife can be credited with making some documented efforts to resolve some of their debts and\nstabilize their finances.  However, the remaining state and federal tax debts are collectively quite\nlarge and involve potentially serious breaches of state and federal fiduciary responsibilities.\nApplicant\u2019s efforts to compromise his payroll tax debts have not achieved fruition to date and\npreclude him from mitigating security concerns over his ability to restore his personal finances to\nacceptable levels of stability and surmount doubts about his ability to discharge his fiducial duties\nover accounts entrusted to his stewardship.  While Applicant is to be commended and encouraged\nin his repayment efforts, more tangible proofs of success are necessary to satisfy minimum standards\nof security eligibility.  \nApplicant asserts that he has acted responsibly in terms of dealing with his debts, and that\nthe Judge has not explained what was irresponsible about his \u201capproach.\u201d  Applicant states that the\nJudge\u2019s adverse conclusion appears to rest on the view that he has not demonstrated responsible\nbehavior with regard to his IRS payroll tax debt.  Applicant then argues that the Board has\npreviously noted that an applicant is not required to be debt-free nor to develop a plan for paying\noff all of his debts immediately or simultaneously.  All that is required is that an applicant act\nresponsibly given his circumstances and develop a reasonable plan for repayment.  Applicant argues\nthat the Judge has not explained what he should have done under the circumstances that he has not\nalready done to rectify his poor financial condition.  Applicant\u2019s assertions do not establish error on\nthe part of the Judge.\nIn making his argument, Applicant cites language contained in the Board\u2019s decision in ISCR\nCase No. 08-06567 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 29, 2009).  That case is factually dissimilar from this one in\nthat the cited case contained evidence that the applicant\u2019s financial situation arose out of\ncircumstances beyond his control and the applicant had successfully resolved his two largest debts\nin addition to some smaller ones.  The Judge reached no similar conclusions in this case and the\nevidence does not warrant such conclusions.  Regarding actions taken by Applicant to address his\nconsiderable debt, the Judge concluded that Applicant was entitled to partial application of\nMitigating Condition \u00b6 20(d).1  However, the Judge reasonably explained why this partial\napplication was insufficient to overcome the government\u2019s security concerns, given the size of\nApplicant\u2019s debt delinquencies and the fact that, outside of the Chapter 7 bankruptcy discharge,\nthere was little evidence to establish that Applicant was making meaningful progress toward the\nsettlement and/or payment of his numerous tax delinquencies.   \n\n4\nAs the trier of fact, the Judge has to weigh the evidence as a whole and decide whether the\nfavorable evidence outweighs the unfavorable evidence, or vice versa.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-\n10320 at 2 (App. Bd. Nov. 7, 2007).  A party\u2019s disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the\nevidence, or an ability to argue for a different interpretation of the evidence, is not sufficient to\ndemonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence or reached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-17409 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2007).\nIn this case, the Judge weighed the mitigating evidence offered by Applicant against the seriousness\nof the disqualifying conduct and considered the possible application of relevant conditions and\nfactors.  He adequately discussed why the disqualifying conduct established under Guideline F was\nnot mitigated.  In particular, the Judge focused on Applicant\u2019s violation of his duty as an employer\nto tender payroll taxes to the government when discussing the larger issue of judgment and trust\nconcerns implicit in financial cases.   \n \nThe Board does not review a case de novo.  The favorable evidence cited by Applicant is not\nsufficient to demonstrate the Judge\u2019s decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g.,\nISCR Case No. 06-11172 at 3 (App. Bd. Sep. 4, 2007).  After reviewing the record, the Board\nconcludes that the Judge examined the relevant data and articulated a satisfactory explanation for\nhis decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.\u2019\u201d Motor\nVehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n of the United States v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983)\n(quoting Burlington Truck Lines, Inc. v. United States, 371 U.S. 156, 168 (1962)).  \u201cThe general\nstandard is that a clearance may be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests of the\nnational security.\u2019\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  Therefore, the\nJudge\u2019s ultimate unfavorable security clearance decision is sustainable.\nOrder\nThe decision of the Judge denying Applicant a security clearance is AFFIRMED.\nSigned: Jeffrey D.

Howry, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro se\n______________\n Decision\n______________\nWESLEY, Roger C., Administrative Judge:\nBased upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility\nfor access to classified information is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case\nOn September 15, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA),\npursuant to Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992,\nand Department of Defense (DoD) Regulation 5200.2-R, issued a Statement of\nReasons (SOR) to Applicant, which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the\npreliminary affirmative determination of eligibility for granting a security clearance, and\nrecommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a security\nclearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.\nApplicant responded to the SOR on October 6, 2009, and requested a hearing.\nThe case was assigned to me on November 9, 2009, and was scheduled for hearing on\nFebruary 24, 2010. The hearing was convened on that date. At hearing, the\nAugust 17, 2010\n\n2\nGovernment's case consisted of ten exhibits (GE). Applicant relied on two witnesses\n(including himself) and 14 exhibits (AE).  The transcript (R.T.) was received on March 9,\n2010.\nProcedural Rulings and Evidentiary Issues\n      \nBefore the close of the hearing, Applicant requested leave to supplement the\nrecord with documented arrangements with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to settle\nhis payroll tax indebtedness. For good cause shown, Applicant was granted 14 days to\nsupplement the record. The Government was afforded two days to respond. Within the\ntime permitted, Applicant supplemented the record with an IRS offer in compromise of\nhis payroll tax debt, and canceled checks for the month of March 2010. Applicant\u2019s\nsubmissions were admitted as AEs P and Q.  \nAfter the record closed, Applicant submitted identical letters addressed to himself\nand his wife, dated August 6, 2010, advising them that were still processing their\ncompromise offer, and expected to contact them within 45 days.  Department Counsel\noffered no objection to admitting the letters, and they were accepted as Applicant\u2019s\nexhibit R.\nSummary of Pleadings\nUnder Guideline F, Applicant is alleged to have (a) petitioned for Chapter 7 bank-\nruptcy protection in June 2008 (discharged in September 2008); (b) be indebted to his\nstate\u2019s franchise tax board in the amount of $5,858; (c) incurred a federal tax lien\ncovering federal income taxes owed in the amount of $43,290; (d) be indebted to the IRS\nfor federal taxes totaling more than $180,000; and (e) accumulated delinquent debts with\ntwo creditors in the respective amounts of  amounts of $16,542 and $1,529. \nIn his response to the SOR, Applicant admitted each of the allegations. He\nclaimed that his listed debts are business-related to a residential home facility that he\nand his wife started in October 1997. He further claimed to have established a payment\nplan with the state to satisfy his personal state tax obligations, and to have retained a tax\nattorney to negotiate with the IRS to satisfy his personal federal tax debts.  He explained\nhe had fallen behind with his mortgage payments (covered by subparagraph 1.p), and to\nhave satisfied the debt covered by subparagraph 1.q.  He stated that he is an Air Force\nveteran with over 20 years of active military service and 13 years of experience working\nin the defense industry.\n                                               \nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 54-year-old administrator of a defense contractor who seeks a\nsecurity clearance. The allegations covered in the SOR and admitted to by Applicant are\nincorporated herein and adopted as relevant and material findings. Additional findings\nfollow.\n\n3\nBackground\nApplicant is married and has three children from this marriage, in addition to a\nstepchild from his wife\u2019s former marriage. GE 1. Applicant enlisted in the Air force in\n1976 and served 20 years of active duty before his retirement in 1996. See GE 1 and AE\nD.  His DD Form 214 notes a number of awards and citations that he received during his\nAir force enlistment.  \nIn January 1997, Applicant and his wife purchased a residential home facility for\nseniors from the building owner for about $30,000 and leased back the building housing\nthe facility. Tr. 56, 60-61, 71-72, 101-23. They purchased the business with very limited\ndue diligence examination of the residential center\u2019s business records and completed\ntheir purchase individually as sole proprietors, and not in a corporate or partnership form.\nTr. 57, 67, 72. The facility was state-licensed in his wife\u2019s name, exclusively. Tr. 102,\n124. By the terms of their business arrangement, Applicant\u2019s wife became the\nadministrator of the facility and in charge of its daily operations. Tr. 59. She had served\nas the facility\u2019s administrator under the previous ownership for over 10 years while\nworking another job, and was familiar with the business. Tr. 73, 122-23. Applicant\nbecame the facility\u2019s chief financial officer and fulfilled his duties on a part-time basis. GE\n4.\nMost of the residents in their facility were Social Security recipients who were\ncharged $947 a month for rent and care. See GE 4. Applicant claimed they produced a\nprofit from the business until 2006. However, they provided no profit and loss statements\nor other business records covering their operations.  Without any earnings statements, it\nis impossible to calculate the facility\u2019s actual revenues and operating costs for any of the\nyears the facility was in operation. \nBeginning in 2006, labor and other operating costs associated with Applicant and\nhis wife\u2019s operation of their 49-bed facility designed to house elderly residents (60 and\nabove) increased substantially. See GEs 2 and 4; Tr. 56-59, 126-32. Because of reduced\noccupancy (i.e., from 49 beds to an occupancy range of 41 to 43) between 2006 and\n2007, and state-imposed restrictions on how much they could increase their resident rent\nand care charges, they could no longer cover their operating expenses. To cover their\noperating deficits, they used their personal and business credit cards. See GE 4; Tr. 60-\n61, 72-73, 94-95, and 112-20.\nBy June 2007, Applicant and his wife had fallen further behind in their business\nand credit card accounts. Tr. 72.  With their increasing debts, they determined they could\nno longer carry on with the business. To save cash, they prioritized their debts and failed\nto pay their business payroll taxes to state and federal taxing authorities as they were\nrequired to do. Tr. 73. They borrowed from their 401(k) retirement accounts to meet their\nbusiness obligations, but ran out of other income sources. Tr. 78. After exhausting their\nbusiness and personal credit cards in their attempts to cover their operating debts and\nexpenses, they still fell short of what they needed to meet their monthly payroll and avert\noperating losses for the facility.  Tr. 72.   \n\n4\nAs part of their efforts to salvage their business, Applicant and his wife offered to\narrange a sale of the business to the building owner, but without success. Tr. 61, 96.\nEven after Applicant and his wife failed to meet their lease obligations in August 2007,\nthe building owner declined to place the building and leased premises up for sale.  Tr.\n96-97.\nNot until October 2007 did the building owner place his property on the market for\nsale. Tr. 98-100. He encountered difficulties, however, in selling the business and the\nbuilding at his asking price. Tr. 99-101. Applicant\u2019s wife noted that the building owner\nreceived several offers in October 2007, but declined them all. Tr. 99. The state licensing\nauthority even offered to assume operations of the facility, but the lessor would not\nentertain the state\u2019s offer.  \nIn December 2007, the building lessor issued an eviction notice to Applicant and\nhis wife. Tr. 100. This placed considerable hardship on the operators of the facility who\nfaced the challenging prospects of trying to place the remaining 23 residents of the\nfacility.  Tr. 100-01.  When the building owner did not renew their lease in January 2008,\nthey abandoned their leased center. Tr. 100.  Neither Applicant nor his wife received\nanything from the lessor who assumed control of the facility after they departed.  Tr. 100-\n01. \nApplicant attributed a confluence of factors to their inability to raise more revenue\nto save their business: Limited ability to expand the facility\u2019s occupancy due to state\nrestrictions on increasing occupancy rates and minimum wage increases that affected\ntheir direct labor costs in running the facility. They lost about eight beds in the 2006-2007\noperating period (from 49 to between 41 and 43 on average), and, as a result, could no\nlonger cover their operating costs and produce a profit. Tr. 94-95, 108-11.\nAccrued debts and efforts to resolve them\nFaced with increased burdensome state regulations and increased taxes on their\nfacility, Applicant and his wife withheld state and federal  payroll taxes collected from\ntheir employees between 2006 and 2008.  By March 2010, these non-remitted payroll\ntaxes exceeded $13,000.00 in withheld state payroll taxes and $160,000 in withheld\nfederal payroll taxes. See GE 4 and AE N. During this two-year period, they also\naccumulated $5,538 in back state personal taxes and accrued $43,296 in back federal\npersonal taxes.  See GEs 4 and 7.  Credit reports indicate that the IRS filed tax liens\nagainst them to cover personal taxes owed for tax years 2006 and 2007, as of December\n2009.  See GE 3 and AE C. \nBesides their major tax accruals, Applicant and his wife accumulated almost\n$500,000 in various consumer debts (mostly credit cards). See AE 7; Tr. 74-75. Because\ntheir credit reports, interview summaries, and testimony do not distinguish their personal\ndebts from their business-related debts associated with the operation of their facility,\ntheir personal and business-related debts cannot be clearly identified and distinguished.\n\n5\nAfter briefly exploring Chapter 13 measures to resolve their debt situation,\nApplicant and his wife elected to  petition for Chapter 7 bankruptcy protection in June\n2008.  See GEs 4 and 7; Tr. 61-63. In their bankruptcy petition, they scheduled $423,278\nin total secured claims. The largest of their scheduled secured claims, was a  $386,663\nfirst mortgage, which  represented the refinanced mortgage they completed in January\n2006. See GE 7 and AE J; Tr. 77-78. They allocated $93,663 of this secured claim to\nunsecured debt. GE 7. Credit reports indicate Applicant and his wife financed the\npurchase of their home in March 1999 with a $136,000 mortgage. GE 2.  Between March\n1999 and January 2006, they refinanced their home several times before they placed a\nfirst mortgage on the property in January 2006.  See GEs , 2, 3, 6, 8, and 10.  \nIn December 2009, their mortgagee (creditor 1.p) filed a notice of default and\nelection to foreclose its first trust deed and copied Applicant and his wife with its\nrecorded filing. See AE J. The mortgagee cited Applicant\u2019s delinquent mortgage\npayments totaling $41,409, as of December 2009. AE J. Their property is currently\nvalued around $238,000 (see AE K), and they estimate they currently owe approximately\n$393,000 on their first mortgage on the property.  Tr. 77.\nMore recently, Applicant and his wife initiated efforts to modify their mortgage\nthrough a third-party intermediary were unsuccessful. See GE 4; AE J. Because\nApplicant and his wife did not reaffirm their first mortgage in their bankruptcy petition,\nthey expected no deficiency. Tr. 68-69. But since June 2008, they have continued to live\nin their home while paying nothing towards the back mortgage obligations. Without any\nchance of modifying their mortgage, they face almost certain non-judicial foreclosure of\ntheir home by May 2010.  AE J: Tr. 88-89.\nIn their Chapter 7 petition, Applicant and his wife scheduled unsecured priority\nclaims of $160,748.  Of these priority claims, $13,323 was allocated to state payroll taxes\nfor 2006 through 2008 and $7,920 for state income taxes for 2006.  GE 7. They allocated\n$139,505 to federal income and payroll taxes owed the IRS from 2006 to 2008.  GE 7. \nBesides their secured and unsecured priority claims, Applicant and his wife listed\nunsecured claims in their Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition of approximately $499,000.  GE\n7. Included in their scheduled unsecured claims were three credit card accounts that\nwere reduced to judgment in December 2007 in the total amount of $57,212.  GE 3.  The\ncreditor recorded its judgment as a lien against Applicant\u2019s property in February 2008.\nGE 4.  Credit records document that the judgment was discharged in bankruptcy.  See\nGE 3.\nAggregate secured and unsecured claims scheduled by Applicant and his wife in\ntheir Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition exceeded $1 million. GE 7. They received a Chapter\n7 discharge in September 2008 in what amounted to a no-asset case (AE A), and\ndocumented post-petition financial counseling. AE G.  Discharged debts encompass the\nunsecured portions of their home mortgage and all of the scheduled unsecured claims.\nNot discharged were their local property taxes (creditor 1.q) and their state and federal\nincome and payroll taxes.  See GE 7.  \n\n6\nFailing to achieve any loan modification to avert foreclosure of their home,\nApplicant and his wife contacted a credit counseling firm in February 2010.  See AE J.\nNo lists of identified creditors and payment schedules are furnished, and it is unclear\nwhat benefits they derived (if any) from their contact with the credit counseling service.\nSee AE J.\nIn November 2007, Applicant and his wife completed an installment agreement\nwith their state\u2019s franchise tax board to repay the reported delinquent state personal\ntaxes they owed for tax year 2006 in the aggregate amount of $7,980.  See AE H; Tr. 63.\nThey agreed to monthly payments of $221 a month, subject to automatic deduction.\nApplicant and his wife made their required monthly payments before they filed for\nChapter 7 bankruptcy protection, but suspended their payments during the pendency of\ntheir bankruptcy. The post-bankruptcy notice they received from the franchise tax board\nin November 2008 reported a $7,559 balance due on their delinquent 2006 personal\ntaxes. \nIn June 2009, Applicant and his wife entered into a new installment agreement\nwith their state\u2019s franchise tax board to repay their computed back state taxes ($12,757)\nfor the tax years of 2006 and 2007. See AE B. They agreed to the automatic deduction\nof $300 a month. Updated summaries furnished by the franchise tax board indicate that\nApplicant and his wife are in payment compliance with their agreement and currently\nowe a little less than $12,000 for both years.  See AE H. \nApplicant and his wife completed an installment agreement with the IRS in\nNovember 2007 to repay their owed federal income taxes owed for the tax year of 2006.\nSee AE I. Initially, they agreed to remit $600 a month to cover the calculated $24,408\nowed for the tax year of 2006. Records indicate that Applicant and his wife complied with\nthe terms of their payment agreement before they petitioned for Chapter 7 bankruptcy\nprotection.  AE I; Tr. 65. \nApplicant and his wife revised their installment agreement following their\nbankruptcy discharge to cover their unpaid 2006 ($13,351) and 2007 ($24,884) personal\nfederal taxes. Under the terms of their revised installment agreement with the IRS,\nApplicant and his wife increased their monthly installment payments to $2,000 a month.\nSee AEs I and O.  By all accounts they have been compliant with their revised payment\nterms.  See AEs I and O; Tr. 80-81. They currently owe the IRS approximately $38,236\nfor their personal taxes for 2006 and 2007.  AE O.\nIn their most recent personal financial statement, Applicant and his wife list their\nhome with an assessed value of $238,000 and a first mortgage on the property in the\namount of $393,000. AE K. They reported net monthly income of $10,517 and net\nmonthly expenses of $6,615 (which presumably includes the $2,300 monthly payments\nthey committed for back state and federal income taxes). See AE K. They reported\nscheduled monthly debt payments of $645. This left them with a reported net monthly\nremainder of $3,257. AE K. Their reported debt payments do not include any rent or\n\n7\nmortgage payments, and it remains unclear how long they will be able to remain in their\nresidence without any monthly mortgage or rental payments.\nApplicant and his wife still owe the IRS approximately $160,000 in withheld payroll\ntaxes for taxes collected  from their employees for the tax years of 2006 and 2007. See\nGE N; Tr. 67-68.  And they still owe over $13,323 in withheld state payroll taxes.  See\nGE 7. Applicant claims his wife pays these state taxes through individual garnishment\nproceedings, but provides no documentation to corroborate his claims. Tr. 63-64. How\nmuch of the outstanding state payroll taxes have been discharged, and whether\nApplicant is at any risk to garnishment in the near future remain unanswered questions. \nBefore the hearing, Applicant and his wife had not made any voluntary attempts to\nresolve their back payroll taxes with either the federal or state taxing authorities. The\nonly tax debt they have been able to document as paid to date is their local property tax\ndebt owed to creditor 1.p. See AE E; Tr. 71-72.\n \nOn March 2010, Applicant and his wife submitted an offer in compromise to the\nIRS. See AE P.  In their Form 656 submission, they cite uncollectibility as the basis of\ntheir compromise submission and offer monthly payments of $1,775 for 24 months (for a\ntotal payout of around $44,000) in satisfaction of their federal payroll tax debt. They\nremitted checks of $1,775 and $150 with their compromise submission, and provided\ncopies of the canceled checks. AE Q. However, they  have not documented any IRS\nacceptance of their payroll tax compromise offer, and it cannot be determined from the\nevidence developed whether the IRS will accept Applicant\u2019s offer, or what additional\npayment conditions the agency will impose, should it elect to compromise the debt.  At\nthis time, the IRS is still processing their offer (see AE R), and has provided no clues of\nwhen or how they will respond to Applicant\u2019s compromise offer.\nEndorsements\nApplicant is well regarded by his current and past supervisors.  He is credited with\nbeing a reliable and trustworthy security manager and administrator with responsibilities\nover corporate credit card accounts. See AE F. Both character references characterize\nApplicant as honest and skilled in his assigned duties and as a credit to his employer.  \nPolicies\nThe AGs list guidelines to be used by administrative judges in the decision-\nmaking process covering DOHA cases. These guidelines take into account factors that\ncould create a potential conflict of interest for the individual applicant, as well as\nconsiderations that could affect the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to\nprotect classified information. \nThese guidelines include \"[c]onditions that could raise a security concern and may\nbe disqualifying\u201d (disqualifying conditions), if any, and many of the \"[c]onditions that\ncould mitigate security concerns.\u201d They must be considered before deciding whether a\n\n8\nsecurity clearance should be granted, continued, or denied. The guidelines do not\nrequire administrative judges to place exclusive reliance on the enumerated disqualifying\nand mitigating conditions in the guidelines in arriving at a decision. Each of the\nguidelines is to be evaluated in the context of the whole person in accordance with AG \u00b6\n2(c). \nIn addition to the relevant AGs, administrative judges must take into account the\npertinent considerations for assessing extenuation and mitigation set forth in AG \u00b6 2(a)\nof the AGs, which are intended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and impartial\ncommonsense decision based upon a careful consideration of the pertinent guidelines\nwithin the context of the whole person. The adjudicative process is designed to examine\na sufficient period of an applicant\u2019s life to enable predictive judgments to be made about\nwhether the applicant is an acceptable security risk. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s conduct, the relevant guidelines are to be\nconsidered together with the following AG \u00b6 2(a) factors: (1) the nature, extent, and\nseriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which\nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\npermanent behavioral chances; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for\npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or\nrecurrence.\n   \nViewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following adjudication\npolicy factors are pertinent herein:\nFinancial Considerations\nThe Concern: Failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts\nand meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of\njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which\ncan raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and\nability to protect classified information. An individual who is financially\noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate\nfunds.  Compulsive gambling is a concern as it may lead to financial\ncrimes including espionage.  Affluence that cannot be explained by known\nsources of income is also a security concern.  It may indicate proceeds\nfrom financially profitable criminal acts. AGs, \u00b6 18.\nBurden of Proof\nUnder the Directive, a decision to grant or continue an applicant's request for\nsecurity clearance may be made only upon a threshold finding that to do so is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest.  Because the Directive requires administrative\njudges to make a commonsense appraisal of the evidence accumulated in the record,\nthe ultimate determination of an applicant's eligibility for a security clearance depends, in\n\n9\nlarge part, on the relevance and materiality of that evidence. As with all adversarial\nproceedings, the judge may draw only those inferences which have a reasonable and\nlogical basis from the evidence of record. \nThe Government's initial burden is twofold: (1) It must prove any controverted\nfacts alleged in the Statement of Reasons, and (2) it must demonstrate that the facts\nproven have a material bearing  to the applicant's eligibility to obtain or maintain a\nsecurity clearance.  The required showing of material bearing, however, does not require\nthe Government to affirmatively demonstrate that the applicant has actually mishandled\nor abused classified information before it can deny or revoke a security clearance.\nRather, consideration must take account of cognizable risks that an applicant may\ndeliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information.\nOnce the Government meets its initial burden of proof of establishing admitted or\ncontroverted facts, the burden of persuasion shifts to the applicant for the purpose of\nestablishing his or her security worthiness through evidence of refutation, extenuation, or\nmitigation of the Government's case.\nAnalysis  \nApplicant was the chief financial officer of a residential center for seniors that he\nand his wife purchased in 1997, and operated for over ten years before succumbing to\ndeteriorating economic conditions and eventual abandonment of the business. For the\nlast three years of his facility\u2019s operation, he and his wife (who operated the facility on a\nfull-time basis) failed to pay state and federal income taxes, while withholding state and\nfederal payroll taxes, and failed to remit them as legally required. During these final\nyears of operation, they accumulated large credit card debts, and defaulted in the\nmortgage on their home. \nBoth the IRS and the state\u2019s franchise tax board filed tax liens to cover back taxes\nowed by Applicant and his wife to the federal and state authorities. While Applicant\u2019s\nmany unsecured personal and business debts (almost $500,000 worth) were discharged\nin his Chapter 7 bankruptcy, his tax debts have not been discharged. Between their\npersonal state and federal tax obligations, Applicant still owe over $200,000 in\nundischarged state and federal personal and payroll taxes. Through refinancing\ninitiatives, they have added almost $250,000 in secured debt to their property and now\nface almost certain foreclosure in the near future. With limited net income at their\ndisposal of just over $10,000 a month, they are obligated to make monthly installment\npayments to state and federal taxing authorities in excess of $2,300. And they have\ncommitted to make monthly $1,775 payments to the IRS under a compromise proposal\nthey have pending with the IRS covering their withheld payroll taxes.\nWhether or not the IRS will accept Applicant\u2019s compromise proposal is an open\nquestion. Failure to escrow and remit withheld escrow taxes collected from employees\nrepresents a serious fiduciary breach and exposes the fiduciary to potential criminal\nliability. At this time, Applicant awaits acceptance of his settlement proposal from the\n\n10\nIRS, and documents no tangible efforts to resolve withheld payroll taxes owed to his\nstate\u2019s taxing authority. The only pre-bankruptcy tax accrual that he has been able to\nresolve is the local property tax owed to creditor 1.q.  \nGarnishment proceedings were initiated by the state against Applicant\u2019s wife to\nrecoup the state\u2019s share of withheld payroll taxes for the covered years. Applicant\nremains vulnerable to state enforcement action as well for as long as these taxes remain\nunpaid.\n         Security concerns are raised under the financial considerations guideline of the\nAGs where the individual applicant is so financially overextended as to indicate poor self-\ncontrol, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, which can\nraise questions about the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information, and place the person at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to\ngenerate funds. Applicant\u2019s accumulation of creditor card and real estate debts, in\naddition to his accrual of significant state and federal tax liens and payroll tax arrearage,\nwarrant the application of two of the disqualifying conditions (DC) of the Guidelines for\nfinancial considerations: DC \u00b6 19(a) \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts\u201d and DC \u00b6\n19(c) \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d\nApplicant\u2019s debts are attributable in part to recurrent revenue shortages caused by\na combination of overly restrictive state restrictions on the operators of residential home\nfacilities (like the one operated by Applicant and his wife), and reduced occupancy rates.\nSee AE 4. Efforts to transfer their facility to either the state or a private party were\nunsuccessful and prompted their seeking Chapter 7 protection, mortgage modification\nrelief, and installment agreements with state and federal tax authorities. Their efforts to\ndate have yielded mixed results.\nTo date, Applicant has not been able to effectuate a compromise settlement with\nthe IRS on withheld payroll taxes owed by himself and his wife, jointly and severally, for\ntax years 2006 and 2007, based on the ground that the taxes are not collectible/.  by\nboth of his companies, and the IRS has reportedly declared these debts uncollectible.\nApplicant provides no documentation of this reported uncollectible status, or IRS\nguidelines for considering compromise offers concerning non-remitted payroll taxes.\nWithout any documented dissolution of the proprietary enterprise he claims to have\nclosed with his wife in 2008, ascertainment of IRS enforcement intentions cannot be\nmade without considerable speculation.  \nApplicant does not provide adequate explanations either as to why he and his wife\ndid not make earlier attempts to arrange payment with state and IRS tax authorities\nregarding their owed payroll taxes. Nor has he provided any documented operating\nledgers, journals, and profit and loss statements covering his residential center\u2019s\nperformance during any of the years of the center\u2019s operation. \nWithout more financial information it is impossible to determine what portion of his\nscheduled unsecured debts in his Chapter 7 bankruptcy were business-related, and\n\n11\nwhich of the scheduled debts were personal ones. Judging from the number of\nrefinanced mortgages Applicant and his wife completed between 1999 and January\n2006, and the size of the accumulated debts they accrued before 2008, it is difficult to\navoid conclusions that they were making business and personal decisions that exceeded\ntheir earnings capabilities.\nSince the hearing, Applicant initiated some follow-up efforts to resolve his\noutstanding payroll tax obligations associated with his operation of his residential center.\nHe has received no acceptance from the IRS to date on his very modest compromise\noffer, and has been told only to expect IRS contact within 45 days.  How and when the\nIRS determines to respond are open questions.  \n Payroll taxes that an employer withholds from an employee never belong to the\nemployer, but rather are held in a constructive trust for the federal government. As a\ntrustee, the employer has a fiduciary duty to properly report and turn over all withheld\ntaxes to the U.S. Government.  Withholding of payroll taxes and failing to escrow them\nrepresents a serious fiducial breach and exposes the violator to potential criminal liability.\nWhile it would be premature to speculate what reactions the IRS might have to\nApplicant\u2019s compromise offer, it is not at all certain the IRS will accept the offer.\nComplicating Applicant\u2019s payroll tax problem is his documented failure to date to make\ncontact with the state\u2019s payroll tax authority to explore compromise arrangements with\nthe state taxing authority.\nMitigation credit to Applicant is very limited based on his furnished proofs. True,\nhe and his wife paid off the local property tax bill (creditor 1.q), and they exerted\nconsiderable efforts in working with third parties to modify their mortgage obligations,\nalbeit without success. Moreover, two of the documented state/federal tax liens\n(associated with creditors 1.b and 1.c) are covered by installment agreements that\nApplicant and his wife have honored from inception. They both completed a successful\nbankruptcy covering debts that are in part business-related.  And any potential deficiency\nliability from the expected foreclosure of their home was discharged in their Chapter 7\nbankruptcy. So, they can be credited with making documented efforts to resolve some of\ntheir debts and stabilize their finances.\nHowever, the remaining state and federal tax debts are collectively quite large\n(over $170,000 allocated between the state and federal payroll obligations for 2006 and\n2007) and involve potentially serious breaches of state and federal fiduciary\nresponsibilities. IRS resolution of Applicant\u2019s compromise offer is likely to be time-\nconsuming, and not susceptible to any easily predictable outcome.  Further, it is less\nthan certain at this juncture whether Applicant and his wife will ever be able to settle his\nstate\u2019s reported payroll tax debt for tax years 2006 through 2008.  Currently, his wife is\nbeing garnished for the unpaid state payroll taxes.  As a co-owner of their proprietary\nbusiness, Applicant remains jointly and severally liable for payment of the outstanding\nstate payroll taxes.  Without satisfaction assured, though, he remains potentially exposed\nto state tax enforcement action (inclusive of garnishment  for any unpaid balance. \n\n12\nOf all of the proven debts listed in the SOR, Applicant is only able to document (a)\ndischarge of creditors with unsecured non-priority claims covered in his Chapter 7\npetition; (b) payment of his local property tax debt; and (c) installment agreements with\nstate and federal taxing authorities covering his personal tax obligations for tax years\n2006 and 2007. The remaining portions of his aggregate debt accruals remain\nunresolved. \nAccordingly, the payroll tax debts linked to the residential center that Applicant\nand his wife owned and operated between 2006 and 2008 are unresolved and remain\nhis legal obligation and responsibility, even if the IRS considers the underlying taxes no\nlonger collectible.  As a result, MC \u00b6 20(a), \u201cthe behavior happened so long ago, was so\ninfrequent, or occurred under circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast\ndoubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment,\u201d cannot be applied\nto Applicant\u2019 situation. MC \u00b6 20 (d), \u201cthe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay\noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts,\u201d has some applicability based on\nApplicant\u2019s documented payments, his bankruptcy discharge, and his installment\nagreements with his state\u2019s franchise tax board and the IRS.                                             \n        \nBecause Applicant and his wife have elected to obtain post-bankruptcy\ncounseling, he may take only limited advantage of MC \u00b6 0(c), \u201cthe person has received\nor is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear indications that the\nproblem is being resolved or is under control.\u201d  While there is some reason to anticipate\nfuture resolution of his federal payroll tax issues based on his documented written\ncompromise offer, he has produced no tangible progress with the IRS to date.  Nor does\nhe provide any tangible evidence of repayment efforts with the state authority\nresponsible for enforcing his state payroll tax obligation. Considered together, Applicant\u2019s\nefforts are not enough to warrant any more than partial application of MC \u00b6 20(c).  \nHolding a security clearance involves the exercise of important fiducial\nresponsibilities, among which is the expectancy of consistent trust and candor.  Financial\nstability in a person cleared to access classified information is required precisely to\ninspire trust and confidence in the holder of the clearance.  While the principal concern of\na clearance holder\u2019s demonstrated financial difficulties is vulnerability to coercion and\ninfluence, judgment and trust concerns are implicit in financial cases (as here).\nWhole person assessment does not help Applicant to overcome the judgment\nlapses associated with his payroll tax debt accumulations and consumer judgment\nconcerns. His active duty military service with the Air Force and long work history in\nproviding conrtact support for the defense contractors he has been associated with are\ncommendable and encouraging. His failure, though, to diligently monitor and ensure\ntimely payroll tax payments to his state and federal tax authorities in connection with his\nresidential home business reflects a lack of adequate attention to his fiducial duties of\nmeeting his business\u2019s  tax obligations.  \nApplicant\u2019s efforts to compromise his accrued payroll tax debts have not achieved\nfruition to date and preclude him from mitigating security concerns over his ability to\n\n13\nrestore his personal finances to acceptable levels of stability and surmount doubts about\nhis ability to discharge his fiducial duties over accounts entrusted to his stewardship.\nThese concerns are not mitigated under the whole person concept.\nTaking into account all of the facts and circumstances surrounding Applicant\u2019s\ndebt accumulations, his earnest but still significantly unresolved steps to discharge his\noutstanding tax debts, and the absence of sufficient efforts to demonstrate his financial\nresponsibility and trustworthiness in managing his finances, Applicant does not mitigate\nsecurity concerns related to his proven debt delinquencies.  While Applicant is to be\ncommended and encouraged in his repayment efforts, more tangible proofs of success\nare necessary to satisfy minimum standards of security eligibility. \nUnfavorable conclusions warrant with respect to the allegations covered by\nsubparagraphs 1.d through 1.o of the SOR.

Marine, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nMALONE, Matthew E., Administrative Judge:\nBased upon a review of the pleadings and exhibits, Applicant\u2019s request for\neligibility for a security clearance is denied.\nOn October 25, 2007, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for\nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP) to obtain a security clearance required for his job with\na defense contractor. After reviewing the results of Applicant\u2019s background\ninvestigation, adjudicators for the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) sent\ninterrogatories to Applicant to obtain clarification of and/or additional information about\nadverse information in his background.  Based on the results of the background\n1\ninvestigation, including Applicant\u2019s response to the interrogatories, DOHA adjudicators\nMarch 19, 2010\n\n Required by Executive Order 10865, as amended, and by DoD Directive 5220.6 (Directive), as amended.\n2\n Adjudication of this case is controlled by the revised adjudicative guidelines, approved by the President on\n3\nDecember 29, 2005, which were implemented by the Department of Defense on September 1, 2006. Pending\nofficial revision of the Directive, these guidelines take precedence over the guidelines listed in Enclosure 2\nto the Directive.\n See Directive, Enclosure 3, Section E3.1.7. The FORM included six documents (Items 1 - 6) proffered in\n4\nsupport of the government\u2019s case.\n2\nwere unable to make a preliminary affirmative finding  that it is clearly consistent with\n2\nthe national interest to continue Applicant\u2019s access to classified information. On\nSeptember 30, 2009, DOHA issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR)\nalleging facts which raise security concerns addressed in the revised adjudicative\nguidelines (AG)  under Guideline F (financial considerations).\n3\nOn November 3, 2009, Applicant responded to the SOR and requested a\ndecision without a hearing. On November 19, 2009, Department Counsel prepared a\nFile of Relevant Material (FORM)  in support of the government\u2019s preliminary decision.\n4\nApplicant received the FORM on November 30, 2009, and was given 30 days to file a\nresponse to the FORM. Applicant did not submit a response before the deadline, and\nthe case was assigned to me on March 5, 2010.\nFindings of Fact\nThe government alleged that Applicant has not filed his federal income tax\nreturns for the tax years from 2003 through 2007 (SOR \u00b6 1.a); that he did not file his\nstate income tax returns for the same period (SOR \u00b6 1.b); and that he owes a $4,681\ndelinquent debt that was unpaid as of the SOR (SOR \u00b6 1.c). Applicant admitted without\nexplanation all three allegations. (FORM, Item 3) In addition to the facts entered in the\nrecord through Applicant\u2019s admissions, I make the following findings of relevant fact.\nIn response to e-QIP question 28.a, Applicant disclosed that he has not filed his\nfederal or state tax returns since 2003.

He served on active duty in the U.S.\n\n Directive. 6.3.\n5\n See Department of the Navy v.

He and his current wife have been married since\nSeptember 2005. He was previously married from September 1978 until he and his first\nwife divorced in October 1987. (Form Item 4)\nPolicies\nEach security clearance decision must be a fair, impartial, and commonsense\ndetermination based on examination of all available relevant and material information,\nand consideration of the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in the revised\nAdjudicative Guidelines (AG).  Decisions must also reflect consideration of the factors\n5\nlisted in \u00b6 2(a) of the new guidelines. Commonly referred to as the \u201cwhole person\u201d\nconcept, those factor are:\n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nThe presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not\ndeterminative of a conclusion for or against an applicant. However, specific applicable\nguidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against them as they\nrepresent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to classified\ninformation. In this case, the pleadings and the information presented by the parties\nrequire consideration of the security concern and adjudicative factors under AG \u00b6 18\n(Guideline F - financial considerations).\nA security clearance decision is intended to resolve whether it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest  for an applicant to either receive or continue to\n6\nhave access to classified information. The government bears the initial burden of\nproducing admissible information on which it based the preliminary decision to deny or\nrevoke a security clearance for an applicant. Additionally, the government must be able\nto prove controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If the government meets its burden, it\nthen falls to the applicant to refute, extenuate or mitigate the government\u2019s case.\nBecause no one has a \u201cright\u201d to a security clearance, an applicant bears a heavy\nburden of persuasion.  A person who has access to classified information enters into a\n7\nfiduciary relationship with the government based on trust and confidence. Thus, the\ngovernment has a compelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the\n\n See Egan; Revised Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 2(b).\n8\n The summary of Applicant\u2019s May 5, 2008, subject interview reflected that he had not filed returns in 2002\n9\neither.\n4\nrequisite judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness of one who will protect the national\ninterests as his or her own. The \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard\ncompels resolution of any reasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in\nfavor of the national interest.8\nAnalysis\nFinancial Considerations\nThe security concern about Applicant\u2019s finances, as stated in AG \u00b6 18, is that: \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.\nThe available information supports the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a - 1.c. Further,\nApplicant admitted that he did not file federal or state income tax returns between 20039\nand 2007. He also owes a debt of $4,681, which has been delinquent since May 2009.\nAvailable information requires application of the disqualifying conditions listed at AG \u00b6\n19(a) (inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts) and AG \u00b6 19(g) (failure to file annual\nFederal, state, or local income tax returns as required or the fraudulent filing of the\nsame).\nBy contrast, the record contains no information that would mitigate or extenuate\nthe adverse security implications of the government\u2019s information. As of December 30,\n2009, Applicant had not presented any information showing the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.c was\npaid, or that he had filed his past-due tax returns as he said he would when he was\ninterviewed for his clearance in May 2008. Applicant\u2019s claim that he may not actually\nowe taxes for the years at issue does not negate the security concerns raised by his\nunwillingness to comply with his annual filing requirement. Accordingly, none of the\nmitigating conditions listed at AG \u00b6 20 apply, and the security concerns about\nApplicant\u2019s finances remain unchanged.\nWhole Person Concept\nI have evaluated the facts presented and have applied the appropriate\nadjudicative factors under Guideline F. I have also reviewed the record before me in the\ncontext of the whole person factors listed in AG \u00b6 2(a). Applicant, a 58-year-old defense\ncontractor, is presumed to be a mature, responsible adult. He has been steadily\nemployed by the same company since 1988. Without additional information about his\n\n See footnote 5, supra.\n10\n See footnote 8, supra. \n11\n5\njudgment, reliability, and trustworthiness, positive inferences to be drawn from his age\nand his stable employment history are not enough to overcome the security concerns\nabout a recent delinquent debt and his failure to file his tax returns for the past eight\nyears. A fair and commonsense assessment  of all available information creates\n10\ndoubts about Applicant\u2019s suitability to hold a clearance that his response has not\nadequately addressed. Because protection of the national interest is paramount in these\ndeterminations, such doubts must be resolved in favor of the government.11\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by section\nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the foregoing, it is not clearly consistent with the national interest\nto grant Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.

Duffy, Esquire, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: James H. White, Jr., Esquire \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nHOGAN, Erin C., Administrative Judge: \n \nOn May 5, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under Guideline J, \nCriminal Conduct, for Applicant. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the \nrevised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, \n2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after \nSeptember 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nOn May 30, 2009, Applicant answered the SOR and requested a hearing \nbefore an Administrative Judge. Department Counsel was prepared to proceed on \nJune 17, 2009. The case was assigned to me on June 18, 2009. DOHA issued a \nnotice of hearing on June 23, 2008, and I convened the hearing as scheduled on July \n13, 2009. The government called no witnesses and offered Exhibits (Gov Ex) 1 \nthrough 3, which were admitted without objection. Applicant\u2019s counsel called five \nwitnesses, including Applicant, and submitted 26 documents which were marked as \nApplicant Exhibits (AE) A \u2013 Z and admitted without objection. DOHA received the \nAugust 7, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n \ntranscript of the hearing (Tr) on July 30, 2009. Based upon a review of the case file, \npleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified information is \ngranted. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn her Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the factual allegation but denies \na security concern remains under criminal conduct.    \n \nApplicant is a 35-year-old employee of a Department of Defense contractor \nseeking to maintain her security clearance.  She has held a security clearance since \nNovember 1991. She is a high school graduate and is close to completing her \nbachelor\u2019s degree. From July 1998 to December 2001, she served on active duty in \nthe United States Navy. She separated as an E-5 with an honorable discharge. She is \ndivorced and has no children. (Tr at 55-57; Gov 1; AE Z)   \n \nIn January 2000, Applicant married a man who had two sons from a previous \nmarriage. Her husband had primary physical custody of the children.  He told \nApplicant to physically discipline the children with a leather belt whenever they lied.  \nEvery time one of the children lied, they were to be punished with five strikes from a \nbelt. Applicant followed her husband\u2019s wishes. She admits to hitting her two stepsons \nwith a belt on at least 40 \u2013 50 occasions over a five year period. Her husband also \ndisciplined the children in this manner. (Tr at 57, 111-114; Gov 2) \n \nOn May 2, 2004, Applicant disciplined the youngest son for lying by striking his \nbuttocks with a leather belt.  The next day, school officials noticed bruises on the boy\u2019s \nback, buttocks and hip area and reported what they observed to Child Protective \nServices. On May 7, 2004, which was a Friday, Applicant received a voice mail from a \ndetective telling her there was a warrant out for her arrest. She contacted the detective \nand told him that she would turn herself in the following Monday. She spent the \nweekend with a friend and turned herself in on Monday. (Tr at 107-108, 116-120; Gov \n2) \n \nApplicant was charged with Injury to a Child (2 counts), a third degree felony. \nOn October 11, 2004, Applicant pled guilty to the charges. She was found guilty and \nsentenced to a five-year suspended prison sentence, ten years of probation, a $1,500 \nfine and $228 court costs.  The court outlined numerous conditions for probation. The \nconditions included avoiding further criminal arrests, staying away from controlled \nsubstances, not associating with persons with felony criminal records, keep gainfully \nemployed, monthly reporting to a probation officer, not leaving the state without \npermission, completing 300 hours of community service, attending an outpatient \naggression control and therapy treatment program, abstaining from alcohol \nconsumption, having no contact with the victims, taking a parenting class and \nattending an outpatient psychotherapy treatment program. (Tr at 60-64, 115; Gov 2 at \n9-15)   \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \nApplicant and her husband separated in May 2004. Their divorce was final in \nApril 2005. She has not seen her stepsons since May 2004. (Tr at 71-72) She suffered \nfrom post-traumatic stress disorder after her arrest. She loved her stepsons and had \ndifficulty dealing with the loss of her husband and two stepsons. (Tr at 64; Gov 2)   \n \nIn November 2007, Applicant moved to another state to accept a new job. As \nrequired under the terms of her probation, she requested the court\u2019s permission before \nmoving to another state.  Her probation case was transferred to the state where she \nmoved. She sees her probation officer at least once a month. Her job requires travel. \nShe requests permission from her probation officer in advance every time she travels \nout of state. Her probation officer wrote a letter on her behalf indicating that Applicant \nhas complied with all the conditions of supervision. She has recommended Applicant \nfor early release from probation. (Tr at 66; AE A) Action on the request is pending. \n \nWhen she was arrested in May 2004, Applicant promptly reported her arrest to \nthe security office of her company. She was aware that the arrest could affect her \nsecurity clearance. (Tr at 68-69)  She listed the charge and conviction on her security \nclearance application as well as on subsequent employment applications. (Tr at 72-73; \nAE S; AE V; AE Z)    \n \nApplicant has not been arrested or formally charged with criminal offenses \nsince the May 2004 arrest. Since the conviction, Applicant has worked to better herself \nas a person. She cannot take away the conviction. She can only learn from it and \nmove on. She has benefited from the counseling and the classes she took as required \nby her sentence. She attended anger management counseling. She took a parenting \nclass.  She saw a counselor for post-traumatic stress disorder. She loves her job and \ntakes her job seriously. (Tr at 98-101)  \n \n \nSeveral witnesses testified on Applicant\u2019s behalf. The operations manager of \nApplicant\u2019s office has known her for two years. He speaks with her about two to four \ntimes a week. He describes her as \u201cserious, capable, and informed.\u201d The clients rely \nheavily on Applicant. She is reliable and demonstrates good judgment. He was initially \nreluctant to hire her because of her felony conviction but decided to do so because \nshe was highly recommended. He recommends her for a security clearance. (Tr at 14-\n27) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s immediate supervisor testified over the phone. She hired Applicant \nin November 2007. Applicant fully disclosed her criminal conviction during the \ninterview process. She works with Applicant daily when she is not on travel. She \ndescribes Applicant as an outstanding employee. When Applicant began to work for \nthe company they were six months behind. Applicant reduced the backlog within three \nmonths. She is very reliable and very aware of the rules pertaining to the collection of \nclassified information. She is honest and has a lot of integrity. She recommends \nApplicant for a security clearance. (Tr at 42-51) \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \n \nA program analyst with Applicant\u2019s company has known her for five years. They \nwork together on projects. They see each other approximately twice a week. She and \nApplicant are also good friends outside of work. Applicant told her about her arrest \nand conviction because of their friendship. She describes Applicant as very reliable \nand trustworthy. She and Applicant attend the same church. The program analyst\u2019s \nhusband is the pastor of the church. He also testified on Applicant\u2019s behalf. He has \nknown Applicant for two years. He sees Applicant every week when she is not \ntraveling. She visits with them in their home and takes part in church activities. (Tr at \n30-39) \n \n \nThe branch chief of one of Applicant\u2019s military customers states he has known \nApplicant for over 10 years. He notes Applicant is very honest. She has been a \nvaluable employee to him and others he supports. She is very trustworthy and \ndependable in her work habits. Prior to starting with her current company, she told him \nthat she was on probation for an abuse case but it would not affect her performance. \n(AE V) \n \n \nApplicant has received numerous accolades and awards for her duty \nperformance. (AE B - AE D; AE G \u2013 AE Q; AE X; AE Y) Her performance reports are \nsuperior. (AE T; AE U; AE W) She is an outstanding employee and people think highly \nof her.    \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In \naddition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative \nguidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are \nuseful in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 \n2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record.  \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \ngovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration \nof the possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nCriminal Conduct \n \n \nThe security concern raised under the criminal conduct guideline is set forth in \n\u00b6 30 of the Revised Adjudicative Guidelines: \n \n \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and \n \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability \n \nor willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations. \n \nThere are two Criminal Conduct Disqualifying Conditions (CC DC) which apply \nto Applicant\u2019s case. CC DC \u00b6 31(a) (a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses) \nand CC DC \u00b6 31(c) (allegation or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether \nthe person was formally charged, formally prosecuted or convicted) apply with respect \nto Applicant\u2019s May 2004 arrest for two counts of injury to a child, a third degree felony. \nShe pled guilty to the charges and was still on probation as of the date of the hearing. \nAs such, CC DC \u00b6 31(d) (individual is currently on parole or probation) is also \napplicable to Applicant\u2019s case.  \n \nThe Government produced substantial evidence to raise the CC DC \u00b6\u00b6 31(a),  \n31(c), and 31(d). The burden shifted to Applicant to produce evidence to rebut, \nexplain, extenuate, or mitigate the security concerns (Directive \u00b6E3.1.15). An applicant \nhas the burden of proving a mitigating condition, and the burden of disproving it never \n\n \n6 \n \n \nshifts to the government (See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. September 22, \n2005.)   \n \n  The following Criminal Conduct Mitigating Conditions (CC MC) potentially \napply to Applicant\u2019s case: \n \nCC MC \u00b6 32(a) (so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior \nhappened, or it happened under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment) \napplies. It has been over five years since Applicant\u2019s arrest. She has not been \narrested since that time. While Applicant\u2019s conduct was serious, it is unlikely that she \nwill repeat similar conduct in the future. Consideration is given to the fact that she \ndisciplined her stepsons at the express wishes of her husband. They are now divorced \nand she has had no contact with her husband and two stepsons for years. She now \nlives in another part of the country. She has complied with all of the terms of her \nprobation and is highly regarded by her superiors and co-workers.  She has been \nforthcoming with her employers about the arrest and conviction. Applicant\u2019s criminal \nconviction does not cast doubt on her current reliability, trustworthiness and judgment.   \n \nCC MC \u00b6 33(d) (there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not \nlimited to the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or \nrestitution, job training or higher education, good employment record, or constructive \ncommunity involvement) applies.  Applicant\u2019s arrest in May 2004 was the first and only \ntime that she has been arrested. She has followed the terms of her probation. Her \nprobation officer has recommended her for early release from probation. She has a \ngood employment record and volunteers with her church in her spare time. Applicant \nhas learned a painful lesson. Since that time, she has moved on with her life in a \npositive manner. She is not a security risk.  \n \nApplicant has mitigated the criminal conduct concern. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the \napplicant\u2019s conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should \nconsider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n\n \n7 \n \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I considered Applicant\u2019s favorable \nwork history and her record of no subsequent criminal conduct over a period of five \nyears. I considered the fact that this was the only time Applicant was ever arrested. I \nconsidered that while Applicant admits to striking her two stepsons with a belt on \nnumerous occasions, she believed she was carrying out her husband\u2019s wishes with \nregard to disciplining the children. She and her husband are now divorced and she is \nnot involved in her stepsons\u2019 lives. She has moved to another part of the country and \ncontinues to excel in her career path. She has been truthful and forthcoming with her \nsecurity office, her employers, and friends about her arrest and conviction. She has \ntreated the arrest and conviction as a painful learning experience. She has \nsuccessfully complied with the terms of her probation. Her probation officer has \nrecommended her for early release from probation. Applicant demonstrated that she is \nnot a security concern. She mitigated the concerns raised under criminal conduct.    \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline J:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.
