    "summary": "Findings of Fact The SOR contains six allegations of disqualifying conduct under AG G, Alcohol Involvement (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. through 1.f.), and four allegations of disqualifying conduct under AG J, Criminal Conduct (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a. through 2.d.). In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the six AG G allegations and the four AG J allegations. Applicant\u2019s admissions are admitted herein as findings of fact. (SOR; Answer to SOR.) 3 Applicant is 30 years old, never married, and employed as a senior consultant by a federal contractor. In 2003, he received a Bachelor of Science degree in Marketing. He has worked for his current employer since June 2008. He has not previously held a security clearance. (Ex. 1; Tr. 33-37.) In 1998, when he was about 18 years old, Applicant was at a party at the home of a girl he knew. He joined with a group of other young people at the party who decided to steal the television set and radio from the girl\u2019s parent\u2019s home. Applicant helped to carry off the speakers to the family\u2019s radio. Applicant was arrested and charged with Theft, Under $300. He cooperated with police, provided evidence against his accomplices, and was not prosecuted. (Tr. 40-41.) Applicant began drinking alcohol in about 1998, when he was approximately 17 or 18 years of age. In January 1999, he was cited for Possession of Alcohol Under 21.

Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance is denied. \n \nApplicant completed and certified an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations \nProcessing (e-QIP) on August 26, 2008. On November 2, 2009, the Defense Office of \nHearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) \ndetailing the security concerns under AG G, Alcohol Involvement and AG J, Criminal \nConduct. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense \nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) \npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the \nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nOn November 12, 2009, DOHA received Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR and his \nrequest for a hearing before an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on \nMarch 30, 2010\n\n \n2 \n \n \nJanuary 4, 2010. I convened a hearing on February 26, 2010, to consider whether it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for \nApplicant. The Government called no witnesses and introduced six exhibits, which were \nmarked Ex. 1 through 6 and admitted to the record without objection. Applicant testified \non his own behalf, introduced no exhibits, and called no witnesses. I left the record open \nuntil March 5, 2010, so that Applicant could, if he wished, provide additional information \nfor the record. On March 4, 2010, Applicant filed one exhibit, which was marked as his \nEx. A and admitted to the record without objection. DOHA received the hearing \ntranscript (Tr.) on March 5, 2010. \n \n \n \n \n \n \nProcedural Matters \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s hearing was originally scheduled for February 10, 2010. A Notice of \nHearing, dated January 14, 2010, was sent to Applicant notifying him of the February \n10, 2010 hearing date. On February 10, 2010, federal agencies in the vicinity of \nWashington, D.C. were closed for public safety reasons as the result of two \nsnowstorms, and it was necessary to cancel Applicant\u2019s hearing. When federal offices \nreopened on February 12, 2010, Applicant and Department Counsel agreed that his \nhearing would be rescheduled for February 26, 2010, and a Notice of Hearing reciting \nthe change was issued on February 17, 2010. On February 24, 2010, Applicant notified \nDepartment Counsel that he had not yet received the Notice of Hearing for the February \n26, 2010 hearing. Department Counsel then sent Applicant an e-mail copy of the Notice \nof Hearing. \n \n \nAt issue, then, is whether Applicant received notice 15 days in advance of his \nhearing, as required under \u00b6 E3.1.8. of the Directive. At his hearing, Applicant, after a \nthorough discussion of the 15-day notice provision, stated that he was prepared to go \nforward with his hearing and believed he had adequate time to prepare for the hearing \non February 26, 2010. He affirmatively waived his right to assert that, because he had \nnot received his Notice of Hearing 15 days in advance of his hearing, he had insufficient \ntime to prepare. (Tr. 10-13.)  \n \n \nIn his response to the SOR, Applicant amended the allegation at \u00b6 1.f. by striking \n\u201c2009\u201d after \u201cJuly\u201d and writing \u201c2008\u201d instead. At the hearing, Department Counsel \nmoved to amend the allegation at \u00b6 1.f. to conform to Applicant\u2019s handwritten change \nand the record evidence as found in Ex. 6. Applicant did not object to the amendment, \nand it was granted. (Answer to SOR; Tr. 26-27.)       \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nThe SOR contains six allegations of disqualifying conduct under AG G, Alcohol \nInvolvement (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. through 1.f.), and four allegations of disqualifying conduct \nunder AG J, Criminal Conduct (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a. through 2.d.). In his Answer to the SOR, \nApplicant admitted the six AG G allegations and the four AG J allegations. Applicant\u2019s \nadmissions are admitted herein as findings of fact. (SOR; Answer to SOR.) \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \n                                           \n \nApplicant is 30 years old, never married, and employed as a senior consultant  \nby a federal contractor. In 2003, he received a Bachelor of Science degree in Marketing. \nHe has worked for his current employer since June 2008. He has not previously held a \nsecurity clearance.  (Ex. 1; Tr. 33-37.) \n \n \nIn 1998, when he was about 18 years old, Applicant was at a party at the home \nof a girl he knew. He joined with a group of other young people at the party who decided \nto steal the television set and radio from the girl\u2019s parent\u2019s home. Applicant helped to \ncarry off the speakers to the family\u2019s radio. Applicant was arrested and charged with \nTheft, Under $300. He cooperated with police, provided evidence against his \naccomplices, and was not prosecuted. (Tr. 40-41.) \n \n \nApplicant began drinking alcohol in about 1998, when he was approximately 17 \nor 18 years of age. In January 1999, he was cited for Possession of Alcohol Under 21. \nHe pleaded guilty, was sentenced to community service, and fined. Before he was 21 \nand able to consume alcohol legally, he drank alcohol to intoxication once or twice a \nmonth. (Ex. 3; Tr. 42-45.) \n \n \nIn 2002, when he was 22 years old, Applicant went to a bar, where he drank \nabout six to eight beers. On the way home, he was arrested and charged with (1) \nDriving or Attempting to Drive under the Influence,1 (2) Driving or Attempting to Drive a \nVehicle While Impaired by Alcohol, and (3) Exceeding Posted Speed Limit. Applicant \npleaded guilty to Count (1).2 He was sentenced to two years of supervised probation3 \nand fined. As a condition of his probation, Applicant was required to abstain from using \nalcohol and to attend a six-week outpatient alcohol-treatment program. He attended the \nalcohol-treatment program and also resumed drinking alcohol weekly about six months \nafter he began his probation.  After Applicant\u2019s first year of supervised probation, his \nprobation officer placed him on unsupervised probation, beginning in June 2003. He \ncontinued to drink a six-pack of beer weekly. (Ex. 1; Ex. 2 at 2; Tr. 46-54.) \n \n \nApplicant also used marijuana. He estimated that, during his college years, he \nused marijuana about 15 times. In June 2003, he was arrested and charged with (1) \nCDS Possession with Intent to Distribute and (2) Possession of Marijuana. He was \nfound guilty of Count (2) and it was placed on the Stet Docket. Count (1) was dismissed. \nApplicant was ordered by the court to complete a 26-week substance-abuse treatment \nprogram. He attended and completed such a program.  (Ex. 1; Ex. 2; Ex. 4; Tr. 54-59, \n79-80.) \n \n \n1 Applicant stated that the charge was Driving While Intoxicated (DWI) and not Driving Under the \nInfluence (DUI). (Tr. 47-48.) \n \n2Counts (2) and (3) were placed on the Stet Docket for one year. \n  \n   \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \n                                           \n \nApplicant\u2019s drug possession conviction occurred while he was on probation for \nhis 2002 conviction for Driving or Attempting to Drive Under the Influence. His probation \nofficer put him back on supervised probation. Applicant stated that he has not used an \nillegal drug since June 2003. He further stated that he was last in the presence of \nindividuals who were using illegal drugs \u201cmore than four years\u201d ago.  (Tr. 59-62.) \n \n \nApplicant became interested in playing poker. He went to a private home and \nplayed poker several times. He knew that those running the poker game were making a \nprofit on the gambling proceeds and that the activity was illegal. In February 2005, the \nhouse where he was playing poker was raided by police, and he was arrested and \ncharged with illegal gambling. He pleaded guilty to the offense and was sentenced to \ncommunity service. Applicant now goes to Las Vegas on occasion, where he \nparticipates in legal gambling.  (Ex. 3 at 3-4; Tr. 62-66.) \n \n \nIn May 2008, Applicant and a friend went to a bar, where Applicant consumed \napproximately eight beers. On the way home, Applicant, who was driving, was arrested \nand taken to the police station. At the station, he was given a breathalyzer test which \nshowed his blood alcohol content to be 0.13 %. Applicant was charged with (1) Driving \nWhile Impaired By Alcohol, (2) Driving, Attempting to Drive Vehicle While Under the \nInfluence, Per Se (3) Driving, Attempting to Drive While Under the Influence,4 and (4) \nFailure to Drive Right of Center. On September 5, 2008, Applicant pleaded guilty to \nCount (1)5. Counts (2), (3), and (4) were nolle prossed.  (Ex. 3 at 3-4; Ex. 5; Tr. 67-69.) \n \n \nApplicant was sentenced to 60 days in jail, with 50 days suspended, and three \nyears of probation.6 His probation will end in September 2011. Under the terms of his \nprobation, Applicant was not permitted to drink alcohol or to use any illegal drugs. His \ndriver\u2019s license was restricted for 45 days: his driving was limited to traveling to and \nfrom work and to and from alcohol-treatment class. Currently, under the terms of his \ndriver\u2019s license, he is prohibited from consuming alcohol and driving a vehicle. (Ex. 5; \nTr. 70-72.) \n \n \nOn July 28, 2008, Applicant voluntarily sought substance-abuse treatment at an \nalcohol-treatment facility. With a counselor, he completed a questionnaire intended to \nmeasure substance abuse or dependence. Official records of the alcohol-treatment \nfacility reveal that two of his answers were diagnostic of alcohol abuse. Clinical notes in \nthe official records of the alcohol-treatment facility state: \u201cClient meets criteria for \n \n4 Charges (2) and (3) were identified as separate traffic violations under the state statute. \n  \n5 Applicant stated that the charge he pleaded guilty to was DUI, Driving Under the Influence of Alcohol. \n(Tr. 68-69.) \n \n6Applicant claimed that his probation officer told him his probation ran for only two years. If that is true, he \nis currently on probation, and his probation will end in September 2010. (Tr. 70-71.) \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \n                                           \nalcohol abuse . . . .\u201d7  On February 17, 2009, Applicant completed the six-month \noutpatient treatment program, with the following prognosis: \u201cGood prognosis based on \nclient completing treatment goals, and [c]omplying with all treatment recommendations. \nClient was also one of the best [p]articipants in group discussions, and was seen as a \nleader in the group.\u201d  (Ex. 6; Tr. 75-77.) \n \n \nSince completing the program, Applicant has not participated in any aftercare \ntreatment or counseling. He does not attend Alcoholics Anonymous or any other \nsupport program. (Tr. 77-78.) \n \n \nApplicant continues to drink alcohol on holidays and special occasions. He last \ndrank alcohol to intoxication on December 31, 2009.  Additionally, he drank alcohol to \nintoxication at weddings in November 2009 and December 2009. (Tr. 78-79.) \n \n \nUnder cross-examination by Department Counsel, Applicant also admitted the \nfollowing: he has been late for work or missed work because of his consumption of \nalcohol; he has experienced hangovers: his last hangover was on January 1, 2010. He \nhas experienced a blackout because of his consumption of alcohol. (Tr. 81-82.) \n \n \nApplicant stated that the longest period that he has abstained from alcohol was \nabout six to eight months.  He does not believe that he has a drinking problem. He \ndrinks alcohol even though he acknowledges that he is forbidden from doing so under \nthe terms of his probation. (Tr. 82-85.) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s manager and supervisor, who has supervised Applicant since June \n2008, provided a letter of character reference. He praised Applicant\u2019s strong work ethic, \nhis positive attitude, and his dependability. He considers Applicant\u2019s work quality to be \nexcellent, and he considers Applicant to be a valued employee. (Ex. A.) \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n    Policies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the \nExecutive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security, and \nit has emphasized that \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the \nNavy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the \nauthority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine \nwhether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. \nat 527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant \nan applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.    \n \n \n \n7Applicant stated he was not seen by a physician or social worker while at the facility. It is unclear from \nthe record what the professional credentials were of the individuals who diagnosed Applicant\u2019s condition \nas alcohol abuse. (Ex. 6; Tr. 77.)  \n\n \n6 \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, an   \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, the administrative judge applies these guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \n  \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \nAnalysis \n \n \nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption \n \nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption, applies in this case to a determination of \neligibility for access to classified information. Under Guideline G, \u201c[e]xcessive alcohol \nconsumption often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment or the failure to \ncontrol impulses, and can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability.\u201d \n \n The following conditions could raise disqualifying security concerns under \u00b6 22 \nof the alcohol consumption adjudicative guideline: \n \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under \nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or \nother incidents of concern, regardless of whether the individual is \ndiagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent; \n \n(b) alcohol-related incidents at work, such as reporting for work in an \nintoxicated or impaired condition, or drinking on the job, regardless of \nwhether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol \ndependent; \n \n(c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired \njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol \nabuser or alcohol dependent; \n \n(d) diagnosis by a duly qualified medical professional (e.g., physician, \nclinical psychologist, or psychiatrist) of alcohol abuse or alcohol \ndependence; \n \n(e) evaluation of alcohol abuse or alcohol dependence by a licensed \nclinical social worker who is a staff member of a recognized alcohol \ntreatment program; \n \n(f) relapse after diagnosis of alcohol abuse or dependence and completion \nof an alcohol rehabilitation program; \n \n(g) failure to follow any court order regarding alcohol education, \nevaluation, treatment, or abstinence. \n \nI have considered all of the disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 22. I find that \nthere is insufficient record evidence to conclude that a duly qualified medical \nprofessionaI or a licensed social worker diagnosed Applicant with the condition of \nalcohol abuse. Therefore, I conclude that AG \u00b6\u00b6 22(d), 22(e), and 22(f) do not apply in \nthis case. However, I find that AG \u00b6\u00b6 22(a), 22 (b), 22(c), and 22(g) are applicable.  \n \n\n \n8 \n \n \nApplicant was cited for underage possession of alcohol in 1999. In 2002 and \n2008, he was arrested for driving while intoxicated or while under the influence of \nalcohol. He has consumed alcohol, in excess and at times to intoxication, from 1998 to \nat least May of 2008, when he was arrested for his second DUI. At his hearing, he \nadmitted that he had reported for work late or had missed work because of his \nconsumption of alcohol. He also admitted that he continues to drink alcohol to \nintoxication, even though the terms of the probation which he is currently serving do not \nallow it. He also denies that he has an alcohol problem. These facts raise security \nconcerns under AG \u00b6\u00b6 22(a), 22(b), 22(c), and 22(g). \n \nThe Guideline G disqualifying conduct could be mitigated under AG \u00b6 23(a) if \n\u201cso much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it happened under \nsuch unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on the \nindividual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d The disqualifying \nconduct could also be mitigated under AG \u00b6 23(b) if \u201cthe individual acknowledges his or \nher alcoholism or issues of alcohol abuse, provides evidence of actions taken to \novercome this problem, and has established a pattern of abstinence (if alcohol \ndependent) or responsible use (if an alcohol abuser).\u201d  If \u201cthe individual is a current \nemployee who is participating in a counseling or treatment program, has no history of \nprevious treatment and relapse, and is making satisfactory progress,\u201d then AG \u00b6 23(c) \nmight apply.  Finally, mitigation might be possible under AG \u00b6 23 (d) if \u201cthe individual \nhas successfully completed inpatient or outpatient counseling or rehabilitation along \nwith any required aftercare, has demonstrated a clear and established pattern of \nmodified consumption or abstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations, \nsuch as participation in meetings of Alcoholics Anonymous or a similar organization and \nhas received a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified medical professional or a \nlicensed clinical social worker who is a staff member of a recognized alcohol treatment \nprogram.\u201d  \n \n \n \nApplicant is now 30 years old. He admitted alcohol-related conduct in high \nschool, in college, and as a post-college professional. His most recent arrest for driving \nunder the influence of alcohol occurred in May 2008 and is therefore recent. He has \nparticipated in alcohol awareness education. He continues to drink alcohol to \nintoxication, he intends to drink alcohol in the future, and he denies that he has an \nalcohol problem. He drinks alcohol even though the terms of his current probation \nproscribe it.  Accordingly, I conclude that none of the Guideline G mitigating conditions \nfully applies to the facts of Applicant\u2019s case. \n \n \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct \n \n \n \nUnder the Criminal Conduct guideline \u201c[c]riminal activity creates doubt about a \nperson\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into \nquestion a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations.\u201d  \nAG \u00b6 30. \n \n\n \n9 \n \n \n \nApplicant, who is 30 years old, admits a criminal history that spans more a \ndecade. In 1998, he was arrested and charged with theft, under $300. In 1999, he was \ncharged with underage possession of alcohol. In 2002 and 2008, he pleaded guilty to \ndriving while intoxicated or driving under the influence of alcohol. In 2003, he was found \nguilty of marijuana possession. In 2005, he pleaded guilty to illegal gambling. He is \ncurrently serving court-ordered probation for his second driving offense related to \nalcohol. He admits that the terms of his probation prohibit alcohol consumption, and yet \nhe continues to consume alcohol. This behavior raises concerns under AG \u00b6\u00b6 31(a), \n31(c), 31(d), and 31(e). AG \u00b6 31(a) provides: \u201ca single serious crime or multiple lesser \noffenses.\u201d AG \u00b6 31(c) provides: \u201callegation or admission or criminal conduct, regardless \nof whether the person was formally charged, formally prosecuted or convicted.\u201d AG \u00b6 \n31(d) provides: \u201cindividual is currently on parole or probation.\u201d AG \u00b6 31(e) provides: \n\u201cviolation of parole or probation, or failure to complete a court-mandated rehabilitation \nprogram.\u201d \n \n \n \nTwo mitigating conditions might apply to Applicant\u2019s case.  If \u201cso much time has \nelapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it happened under such unusual \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s \nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment,\u201d AG \u00b6 32(a) might apply.  If \u201cthere is \nevidence of successful rehabilitation, including but not limited to the passage of time \nwithout recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or restitution, job training or higher \neducation, good employment record, or constructive involvement,\u201d then AG \u00b6 32(d) \nmight apply. \n \n \n \nThe record demonstrates that Applicant\u2019s criminal behavior, which began in 1998 \nand has continued to the present, is, therefore, recent. A supervisor provided a letter of \ncharacter reference indicating he valued Applicant as a good and reliable employee. \nHowever, Applicant has not yet established a record of sobriety to assure that his long-\nstanding criminal behavior and rule violations related to alcohol use are unlikely to \nrecur. His inability or unwillingness to comply with his probation by abstaining from \nalcohol use continues to cast doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, and good \njudgment.  I conclude that neither AG \u00b6 32(a) nor AG \u00b6 32 (d) applies. \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of an applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \n\n \n10 \n \n \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is a young adult who is \nwell educated and skilled. His employer considers him to be a dependable and an \nexcellent worker. \n \nAt the same time, Applicant has been arrested twice for driving a vehicle while \nunder the influence of alcohol. He has also been convicted of marijuana possession, \nand he pleaded guilty to illegal gambling. After his first alcohol-related arrest in 2002, he \nwas ordered to take a course in alcohol education. Even after being made aware of the \ndangers of drinking and driving, he was again arrested for driving under the influence of \nalcohol in 2008. After his second arrest for driving under the influence, Applicant \nvoluntarily enrolled in a substance abuse program. However, despite completion of the \nprogram, he continues to drink alcohol, which violates the terms of his existing \nprobation. He denies he has an alcohol problem and persists in drinking to intoxication. \nHe has a history of violating rules, laws, and legal orders, raising security concerns \nabout his judgment, trustworthiness, and reliability.   \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns arising from his alcohol \nconsumption and criminal conduct.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline G:  \n \nAGAINST  APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a. - 1.f.:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline J:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a. - 2.d.:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \n\n \n11 \n \n \n \n \n                                   Conclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_________________________________ \nJoan Caton Anthony \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Howry, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nWHITE, David M., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant accrued about $30,000 in delinquent debt between 2002 and 2005 while\nfounding and working in a start-up technology company. Once the company began\nearning enough money for him to draw a regular salary, he began paying off his debts. All\nbut two minor debts are fully resolved, and he has taken all possible steps to resolve\nthem. His company was bought by a major defense contractor, for whom he now works\nwith a substantial salary. Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and\ntestimony, eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \nApplicant submitted his security clearance application (SF 86) on September 3,\n2008. On November 20, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nissued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under\nGuideline F (Financial Considerations). The action was taken under Executive Order\n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as\namended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel\nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the\nAugust 9, 2010\n\n2\nadjudicative guidelines effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after\nSeptember 1, 2006. \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on December 18, 2009. He answered\nthe SOR in writing on January 28, 2010, and requested a hearing before an\nadministrative judge. Department Counsel was prepared to proceed on February 27,\n2010, and the case was assigned to me on March 10, 2010. DOHA issued a Notice of\nHearing on March 25, 2010, and I convened the hearing as scheduled on April 9, 2010.\nThe Government offered exhibits (GE) 1 through 9, which were admitted without\nobjection. Applicant offered exhibits (AE) A through H, which were also admitted without\nobjection, and testified on his own behalf. I granted Applicant\u2019s request to leave the\nrecord open until April 23, 2010, to permit submission of additional evidence. DOHA\nreceived the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on April 16, 2010. On April 19, 2010, Appellant\nsubmitted AE I, which was admitted without objection and the record was closed.\nFindings of Fact\nIn his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted that he formerly owed some of the\nSOR-listed debts, but denied that he presently owes any of them for the reasons\ndiscussed below. Applicant\u2019s admissions are incorporated into the following findings. \nApplicant is a 47-year-old program director, employed by a major defense\ncontractor since September 2007. He is married for the second time, with three adult\nchildren. He served one enlistment in the Army, from 1980 to 1984, during which he held\na Top Secret security clearance. (AR; GE 1; Tr. 10, 25, 84, 94-96.)\nApplicant and his first wife divorced in 2000. In 2002, he left his job and moved\nacross country to the state where she and their three children had relocated. He and two\nformer colleagues founded a technology company. He planned to live on his accumulated\nsavings until the company became profitable. That process took longer than anticipated\nand, although he moved in with his former wife and surrendered his car to the bank in a\nvoluntary repossession to minimize his expenses, he accumulated some debts that\nbecame delinquent. In 2005, the company became profitable enough that he could begin\ndrawing a regular salary and he began to resolve those debts. In 2007, his current\nemployer purchased the company and hired Applicant and his partners as employees.\nSince then, his annual salary has increased from $126,000 to $177,000, and he has\naccumulated about $97,000 in retirement savings. He also has about $14,000 in regular\nsavings. He recently purchased a home with a 30-year fixed rate mortgage, and has a\nmonthly budget surplus of about $1,300. (AR; AE A; AE B; AE H; Tr. 27-28, 74-77, 80-\n83.)\nThe debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a in a $40 medical bill. The creditor is not identified\non any of the record credit reports, and Applicant has been unable to identify who\nreported this matter to Equifax. No one has contacted him directly about this debt. He\nsubmitted internet requests to the credit bureaus seeking the identity of the creditor so he\ncould resolve the matter, but had no reply by the date of his hearing. After the hearing, he\n\n3\nsubmitted a letter to Equifax, the only credit bureau listing the debt, asking them to\nidentify the creditor or remove the entry from his credit report. If it is valid, he is able and\nwilling to pay it. This is the only delinquent debt reported on Applicant\u2019s April 3, 2010\ncredit report. (AR; GE 2; GE 9; AE I; Tr. 45-46, 52-53.)\nThe two delinquencies alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.i are duplicate listings of the\nsame debt held at different times by different collection agencies. It originated with the\nlandlord of the apartment Applicant moved out of when he moved into his ex-wife\u2019s house\nto reduce his living expenses. Applicant settled this debt in February 2007. (AR Att. B;\nGE 2; GE 7; Tr. 53-54, 66-71.)\nThe debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c and 1.g were apparently for the final month of\nelectricity and cable television services, respectively, in the apartment mentioned above.\nApplicant had not received those bills, and had two subsequent accounts with each\ncompany without being informed about them. He first learned about them when\ninterviewed concerning his credit report, and began inquiries to determine whether they\nwere valid. When they remained matters of concern on the SOR, he contacted both\ncreditors and just paid them in late January 2010 to resolve matters. (GE 4; AR Att. C; AE\nB Att. G; Tr. 55-56, 58-61.)\nApplicant also first learned about the $244 medical services account delinquency\nalleged in SOR \u00b6 1.d during his security interview. He had received no prior billing\nconcerning this account. After he was able to identify the creditor through researching his\ncredit report, he paid this amount during January 2010. (GE 4; AR Att. D; Tr. 56-57.)\nThe $3,343 debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.e involved a store credit card that Applicant\u2019s\nex-wife used. Applicant had no knowledge of this debt until his security interview. He\ncontacted the card-issuing company, who showed the account existed only in his ex-\nwife\u2019s name. That company, however, could not correct the credit bureau report without\naction by the store that issued the card. Applicant has written to the store to dispute their\nclaim that he owes this debt, but heard nothing in response. After his hearing, he wrote to\neach of the major credit bureaus explaining the situation and disputing this account. (AR\nAtt. E; AE I; Tr. 46-52.)\nSOR \u00b6 1.f alleges that a $9,678 credit card debt remained unpaid as of the date of\nthe SOR. This debt was one on which Applicant fell behind while trying to get his\nbusiness started. He contacted the creditor and settled this debt on May 20, 2005. It is no\nlonger reflected on his credit report. (AR Att. F; AE B Att. F; Tr. 57-58.)\nThe debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.h resulted from the voluntary repossession of\nApplicant\u2019s car discussed above. He settled this account with the collection agency on\nJune 14, 2005. He reported this settlement to the credit bureaus that formerly reported\nthe debt, and succeeded in having it removed from all of his credit reports. (AR Att. H; AE\nB Att. H & H1; Tr. 61-65.)  \n\n4\nThe debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.j was for another credit card account that became\ndelinquent in 2003. He settled this account with the collection agency and made his final\npayment in August 2007. (AR Att. J; GE 4 at 6; Tr. 71-72.)\nApplicant submitted letters and testaments from many friends and professional\ncolleagues praising his integrity, responsibility, and trustworthiness. (AE C through G.)\nHis demeanor and presentation throughout his hearing reflected his complete\nunderstanding of his financial situation, his maturity and intention to honorably repay all of\nhis legitimate debts, and his understanding of the importance of security matters.  \nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief\nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially\ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s\noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According\nto AG \u00b6\u00b6 2(a) and 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable\nguidelines in the context of a number of variables known as the whole-person concept.\nThe administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the\nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to classified\ninformation will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I\nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the\nevidence contained in the record. I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere\nspeculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201c[t]he applicant is\nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or\nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the\nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d Section 7\nof Executive Order 10865 provides that \u201c[a]ny determination under this order adverse to\nan applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no\nsense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d \nA person applying for access to classified information seeks to enter into a\nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\n\n5\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nAG \u00b6 18 expresses the security concern pertaining to financial considerations:\nFailure or inability to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially over-extended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. Compulsive\ngambling is a concern as it may lead to financial crimes including\nespionage. Affluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income\nis also a security concern. It may indicate proceeds from financially\nprofitable criminal acts.\nAG \u00b6 19 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be\ndisqualifying. Department Counsel asserted that the evidence would show the\napplicability of two of these potentially disqualifying conditions: \n(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nFrom 2002 to 2005, Applicant accumulated SOR-listed delinquent debts that\ntotaled about $30,000. He subsequently resolved all but two of these debts. One medical\nbill for $40 he can and would gladly repay but the credit bureaus have yet to respond to\nhim with the identity of the alleged creditor. He is also able to repay the other SOR-\nalleged delinquency that was incurred by his ex-wife if it is shown that he has any\nresponsibility for it. He has done all that he can to communicate with the credit bureaus to\nattempt resolution of both of these debts. He is fully solvent, with significant excess\nmonthly income over his regular living expenses. Accordingly, he has eliminated the\nformerly applicable security concerns under AG \u00b6 19(a). He is not under continuing\nfinancial duress, so he is no longer at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate\nfunds. The evidence established a brief history of not meeting some financial obligations\nwhile starting a new business from 2002 to 2005, raising potential security concerns\nunder AG \u00b6 19(c).\n\n6\nAG \u00b6 20 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising from the\nforegoing financial considerations. The potentially applicable mitigating conditions are:\n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred\nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt\non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;\n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond\nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn,\nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the\nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;\n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is\nunder control;\n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or\notherwise resolve debts; and\n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the\npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented\nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of\nactions to resolve the issue.\nMitigation under AG \u00b6 20(a) was fully established. Applicant\u2019s delinquencies arose\nbecause the new business he started with colleagues was not profitable as quickly as\nthey planned. After it became profitable, he repaid creditors and was subsequently\nbought out by his current employer. He earns a sufficient salary that recurrence is\nunlikely. His conduct throughout was honorable, and casts no doubt on his reliability,\ntrustworthiness, or judgment. Some mitigation under AG \u00b6 20(b) was also established.\nApplicant voluntarily left a comfortable employment situation to start a new company and\nbe closer to his children. He thought he had sufficient savings to survive the start-up\nperiod, but underestimated what he would need. Once he realized he could not draw a\nregular salary and still keep the business going, he drastically reduced his living\nexpenses, but still incurred some delinquent debt. As soon as the business became self-\nsustaining, he began resolving his outstanding debts. \nApplicant provided no evidence of financial counseling, but demonstrated his full\nunderstanding and capable management of his financial situation. He has fully resolved\nhis earlier delinquencies except one unidentifiable $40 medical debt, and a credit card\ndebt belonging solely to his ex-wife. He has more than sufficient resources to resolve\nboth of these matters when and if the legitimacy of the debts is determined. These are\nsubstantial steps in the right direction, creating substantial mitigation under AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(c)\nand (d). Moreover, Applicant demonstrated his present solvency and ability to avoid\nadditional delinquencies in the future. Applicant has taken all possible steps to dispute his\nresponsibility for the two unresolved delinquencies under AG \u00b6 20(e). \n\n7\nAs the Appeal Board has ruled concerning the successful mitigation of security\nconcerns arising from financial considerations, \u201c[a]n applicant is not required to show that\n[he] has completely paid off [his] indebtedness, only that [he] has established a\nreasonable plan to resolve [his] debts and has \u2018taken significant actions to implement that\nplan.\u2019\u201d ISCR Case No. 06-12930 at 2 (App. Bd. Mar. 17, 2008) (quoting ISCR Case No.\n04-09684 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Jul. 6, 2006)). This applicant has established and substantially\nimplemented an effective plan to resolve the debts that could formerly have given rise to\nsecurity concerns.\nWhole-Person Concept\nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the\nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the applicable guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the\npertinent facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant\u2019s conduct of security\nconcern was incurring some delinquent debts, which totaled about $30,000, between\n2002 and 2005. He fully resolved all but two of these debts, one of which involves $40 to\nan unidentified creditor, and the other of which, for about $3,000, he legitimately disputes\nowing. He has more than sufficient resources to pay these debts if shown to be valid, and\nhas contacted the credit bureaus and known creditors seeking the information needed to\nresolve them. His actions have fully mitigated the formerly applicable security concerns,\nand he has established a good-faith track record of financial responsibility. The record\ndemonstrates his ongoing ability to avoid any future delinquent debt, and his excellent\nperformance of responsible duties at work. Applicant\u2019s actions have eliminated any\ncontinuing potential for pressure, coercion, or duress. He demonstrated that his financial\nproblems are unlikely to recur. Applicant presented sufficient evidence to fully mitigate\nsecurity concerns arising from his brief history of failing to meet financial obligations, and\nhis former inability to pay some delinquent debts. The record generates significant\nconfidence as to his present eligibility and suitability for a security clearance.\n \n\n8\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as\nrequired by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a through 1.j:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly\nconsistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.\n                                             \nDAVID M. WHITE\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance is denied. \n \nOn February 20, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) \nissued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under \nGuidelines F. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of \nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative \nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective \nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on March 24, 2009, and requested an \nexpedited hearing before an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on \nFebruary 1, 2010. DOHA issued a Notice of Hearing on February 4, 2010. I convened \nthe hearing as scheduled on February 16, 2010. Applicant waived her right to 15 days \n \n1 \n \n \nMarch 30, 2010\n\n \n2 \n \n \n                                                          \nnotice. The government offered Exhibits (GE) 1 through 11. Applicant did not object and \nthey were admitted. Applicant testified and offered Exhibits (AE) A through O, which \nwere admitted without objection. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on \nFebruary 22, 2010.  \n \nProcedural Matters \n \n \nDepartment Counsel moved to amend the SOR by adding allegation \u00b6 1.h, to wit: \n\u201cfailed to file her annual federal income tax returns, as required, for 2001, 2002, 2003, \n2004, and 2005.\u201d Applicant did not object. Applicant was given the opportunity to \npostpone the remainder of hearing for at least 15 days to provide her with proper notice \nand time to prepare her response to the additional allegation. She understood her rights \nand agreed to proceed. The record was held open until March 3, 2010, to allow her to \nsubmit any additional information or documentation. She provided AE P through II.1 \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant admitted SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, and 1.c. She denied SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d, 1.e, 1.f, \nand 1.g. At her hearing she admitted SOR \u00b61.h. After a thorough and careful review of \nthe pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of fact.  \n \n \nApplicant is 55 years old. She is not married and has no children. She is a \ncollege graduate and has completed some post-graduate courses. She worked 19 \nyears for the federal government and resigned in June 1999, due to health reasons. \nShe held a secret security clearance while employed by the federal government. She \nthen began a career as a real estate agent. She worked for a company from 1999 to \n2002. She changed companies and worked for a new employer from March 2002 to \nMarch 2008. In March 2008, she left the real estate business and began working for a \nfederal contractor until April 2009. She was unemployed from April 2009 to September \n2009. She stated she did not terminate her employment under adverse conditions, but \nrather it was a job that did not suit her expertise and she was \u201cinvoluntarily let go.\u201d2 She \nobtained new employment with a federal contractor in September 2009, and worked \nuntil January 2010. She was offered a better job in December 2009, but it is contingent \nupon her obtaining a security clearance.3 Applicant stated that although she was \nemployed after 2002, her income was reduced due to the economic climate of the real \nestate market.4 \n \n \nApplicant broke her ankle in 2001, and she required three and a half months to \nrecover. She did not earn any income while she was convalescing. In 2002, she had \n \n1 Tr. 126-135. \n \n2 Tr. 83. \n \n3 Department Counsel provided information that Applicant is properly sponsored for a security clearance \nand there is proper jurisdiction in this case.  \n \n4 Tr. 40-42, 77-88; AE J. \n\n \n3 \n \n \n                                                          \nmedical issues that required two surgeries and she could not work most of the year \nbecause she was physically unable. In 2003, a ten-year relationship with a partner she \nlived with ended, and she had to establish a separate household. She stated this \nnegatively impacted her finances. In 2005 and 2006, she stated the real estate market \nwas declining and it affected her finances. She decided to leave the real estate \nbusiness sometime in 2008.5 \n \n \nApplicant did not file her 2001 federal income taxes on time. She explained that \nshe broke her ankle and had surgery in March 2001, and then got \u201csidetracked\u201d from \nfiling.6 Applicant did not file her 2002, 2003, 2004, and 2005 federal income tax returns \non time. She explained, \u201cI will say that it was like an ostrich with the head in the sand. I \nfelt overwhelmed.\u201d7 She also explained, \u201cI was so overwhelmed with my illness and the \nreal estate market wasn\u2019t doing well.\u201d8 Due to her illness she was trying to stabilize \nherself. She admitted she did not address her delinquent taxes until she was attempting \nto file for bankruptcy in 2007, so she could save her house from foreclosure.9  \n \nApplicant first attempted to file for bankruptcy in early 2007, and the IRS objected \nto the filing until Applicant filed her delinquent federal tax returns for 2001, 2002, 2003, \n2004, and 2005. She had not addressed her delinquent taxes before then. She \nunderstood that she was required to file her taxes each year, and had done so before \n2001. She did not have money withheld from her income during the years she did not \nfile. As part of her answer to the SOR, she provided a document from the IRS dated \nFebruary 6, 2009. It stated that Applicant, through her attorney, submitted all personal \nfinancial disclosure documents on December 29, 2008. Her case was then assigned to \na revenue officer for processing. The matter was being reviewed in order to make \npayment arrangements. The letter noted Applicant was cooperative and had some \nextenuating circumstances.10 \n \nApplicant provided a letter included with her answer to the SOR, and attached to \nInterrogatories to DOHA, dated September 12, 2008. 11 She stated:  \n \nMy finances have been stabilized since I secured a full-time position at \n[Company] on 31 March 2008. Prior to this I was self-employed as a Real \nEstate Associate Broker. The [r]eal [e]state market suffered through the \n \n5 Tr. 37-40 AE C. \n \n6 Tr. 92-94; Federal income taxes are required to be filed by April 15th of the following tax year. \n \n7 Tr. 97-98. \n \n8 Tr. 43. \n \n9 Tr. 37-43, 90-98, 119-121. \n \n10 Tr. 43-50, 94-98. \n \n11 GE 6. \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \n                                                          \nfailure crisis of the sub-prime market. With the loss of income, I searched \nfor full-time employment and my savings depleted. \n \n* * * \n \nWith a stable income I have been able to effectively meet my monthly \nobligations and begin to save in [Company\u2019s] 401K and investment \nprograms.  \n \nThank you for reviewing my financial status as I have accomplished \ncorrecting and stabilizing my financial future with capturing a great \nemployment opportunity with [Company] working on [military] [s]ystems. \n \nIn the same letter, Applicant also mentioned two accounts that were listed on her credit \nreport. She made a hand written notation that arrangements were made to pay one \naccount and the other was paid. She did not mention or address her delinquent tax \ndebts.  \n \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR dated March 24, 2009, she stated:  \n \nI found myself in a situation owing back taxes. I experienced illness that \nrequired several surgeries. Once I got back to work I found myself trying to \ncatch up on my bills. I later was diagnosed with diabetes and required \nconstant medical monitoring and expensive drugs to maintain my health. \nPaying my back taxes is one of the most important actions that face me. I \ncontacted the Internal Revenue Services to initiate a payment \narrangement. I have enclosed a letter from [the] Internal Revenue Service \ndated February 6, 2009, expressing my efforts to resolve this matter and \nestablish a payment arrangement. Payment arrangements should be \nfinalized during the week of March 30, 2009. \n \nApplicant stated she set up a voluntary payment plan in April 2009, with the IRS. \nShe was unable to implement the plan because she was unemployed until September \n2009. She stated she made a payment of $100 in 2008 to the IRS and another $50 \npayment some other time.12 Applicant\u2019s case was temporarily closed by the IRS on April \n29, 2009, and listed as \u201ccurrently not collectible.\u201d She was advised that she still owed \nthe delinquent taxes and penalties, and interest would continue to accrue. In addition, \nshe was advised that offsets of future tax refunds would be applied and her case was \nsubject to re-opening if her situation improved.13 Applicant did not contact the IRS to \nbegin payments when she got a job in September 2009 because she did not think she \nwould be staying in the job.14 She contacted the IRS in January 2010, to obtain a new \n \n12 Tr.106. \n \n13 AE D. \n \n14 Tr. 108. \n\n \n5 \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                          \nbalance on the amount of delinquent taxes she owes. A balance was not provided \nbecause the case in currently closed. She has not made any other payments.15  \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.c listed a delinquent balance for Applicant\u2019s federal income taxes of \n$62,802. She believes the amount is about a $61,000, but did not provide documentary \nproof. Applicant was collecting unemployment benefits, when she was not working. \nApplicant stated she filed her 2006, 2007 and 2008 tax returns on time.16 Applicant \nprovided proof she filed her 2007 and 2008 federal tax returns on time. Her 2006 federal \nincome tax return was filed on July 16, 2007.17 She provided documentation to show \nshe filed her 2001 and 2003 federal income tax returns on August 3, 2007. She filed her \n2002 federal income tax return on August 11, 2007. She filed her 2004 and 2005 federal \nincome tax returns on July 16, 2007.18  \n \nApplicant was delinquent in filing her state income tax returns for tax years 2001, \n2002, 2003, 2004, and 2005. She did not file her state income tax return for 2006 until \nJuly 16, 2007, when the deadline for filing was April 15th. Applicant provided copies of \nher 2001 through 2008 state income tax returns. She filed her 2001 and 2003 state \nincome tax returns on August 3, 2007. She filed her 2002 state income tax return on \nAugust 11, 2007. She filed her 2004, 2005, and 2006 state income tax returns on July \n16, 2007. Her 2007 and 2008 state income tax returns were filed on time. She did not \nprovide proof that she has paid the state income tax she owes.19  \n \nApplicant\u2019s Chapter 13 bankruptcy was filed in June 2007 and dismissed in \nAugust 2007. She filed another petition on September 17, 2007. She completed the \nmandatory credit counseling. Under Schedule F, Creditors Holding Unsecured \nNonpriority Claims, she listed consumer debt as $31,522.20 She filed an Amended \nChapter 13 plan on February 18, 2008. The Chapter 13 bankruptcy was dismissed on \nApril 9, 2008. Applicant stated she has also participated in credit counseling with a \nprivate enterprise that has helped her file the delinquent taxes returns. Applicant stated \nthat she has settled or paid the creditors that were listed in the bankruptcy.21  \n \n \n \n15 Tr. 47, 108. \n \n16 Tr. 103. \n \n17 Tr. 103-105; AE AA, BB, CC, DD, EE, FF, GG, HH, II.  \n \n18 Tr.52-54, 105. \n \n19 Applicant\u2019s failure to file and pay her state income taxes is not alleged and I have not considered it for \ndisqualifying purposes. However, I will consider it when analyzing her credibility, her financial situation, \nand the \u201cwhole-person.\u201d  \n \n20 GE 2. \n \n21 Tr. 113-114. \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \n                                                          \nApplicant purchased a house in 2003. The cost was $311,000. She paid $9,000 \nfor the down payment. She stated she also paid the closing costs on the house, which \nwas 6% of the cost of the house. She did not explain whether she actually paid $18,660, \nor if it was included in the financing. She explained that she had the funds for the \npayments from the equity in a house she had sold. When asked why she bought a \nhome in 2003, instead of renting and paying her taxes, she stated, \u201dI\u2019ve always owned a \nhouse ever since I was 29 years old. And I\u2019ve always lived in a house.\u201d22  \n \nApplicant stated she withdrew the balance of her 401(k) retirement account. She \npaid the taxes and penalty associated with the withdrawal. She used the money from \nthe account to pay her mortgage and for another debt not listed on the SOR.23 \n \n \nThe debt in SOR \u00b6 1.d ($786) was incurred in approximately 2007. Applicant \nstated she contacted the creditor twice in July 2008. She admitted she owes the debt \nand it is not paid.24  \n \n \nThe debt in SOR \u00b6 1.e ($845) was for a membership to a direct buying service. \nApplicant advised the creditor she would pay $50 a month on the debt beginning on \nFebruary 26, 2010. No payments have been made at the time of the hearing.25  \n \n \nThe debt in SOR \u00b6 1.f ($178) was for medical services. Applicant stated she did \nnot have health insurance for a period of time and paid many medical debts, but she is \ndiscovering other ones. She explained she would contact the credit bureau to determine \nwhat company owns this debt. She has not yet done so. The government conceded \nthey did not know the name of the creditor.26  \n \n \nThe debt in SOR \u00b6 1.g ($299) was incurred in September 2006, when Applicant \npurchased two 32-inch flat screen televisions at a cost of $1,799 for both. She stated \nthe debt is no longer on her credit report and she paid the remaining balance. Applicant \nprovided evidence, in her answer to the SOR, that there is a remaining balance of $75 \nowed on this debt. She purchased the item when the real estate market was depressed \nand she was not earning significant income.27  \n \n \nApplicant provided a copy of her work performance evaluation for the period of \nNovember 1997 to May 1998. It stated she was a dynamic professional who \n \n22 Tr. 98-100, 107. \n \n23 Tr. 48-49. \n \n24 Tr. 54-57. \n \n25 Tr. 58-61. \n \n26 Tr. 61-63. \n \n27 Tr. 63-71; Answer to SOR. \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \n                                                          \ndemonstrated intelligence and poise.28 Character letters described her as trustworthy, \nhard working, and capable of interacting with all levels of the command. She was \nrespected for her honesty and integrity, consistently showing good judgment and \nmaintaining a high ethical standard.29 \n \nApplicant explained that she has handled the financial aspects of real estate \ntransactions and she has high standards. She maintains a budget on a spreadsheet. \nShe owes some personal loans from her family, but does not owe any other delinquent \ndebts, nor does she have any new delinquent debts. She intends to pay her delinquent \ndebts.30  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \n \n \n28 Tr. 73-76; AE K. \n \n29  Tr. 73-76; AE L, M. \n \n30 Tr. 73-76, 111-118, 122-125. \n\n \n8 \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG & 18:  \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. I have \nconsidered all of the disqualifying conditions under AG & 19 and especially considered: \n \n(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts;  \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n \n(g) failure to file annual Federal, state, or local income tax returns as \nrequired or the fraudulent filing of the same. \n \nAppellant has delinquent debts that remain unpaid. She failed to timely file her \nfederal tax returns for tax years 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004, and 2005. She filed them in \n2007. Her delinquent federal taxes remain unpaid. I find there is sufficient evidence to \nraise the above disqualifying conditions.  \n \n\n \n9 \n \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. I have considered the following mitigating \nconditions under AG \u00b6 20: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control; and  \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s behavior is recent because her delinquent debts remain current and \nunpaid. They are not isolated. I find mitigating condition (a) does not apply. \n \n \nApplicant broke her ankle in 2001 and was unable to work for three and a half \nmonths. In 2002, she experienced other medical problems. In addition, the real estate \nmarket was depressed and her ten-year personal relationship ended. These events \nimpacted her finances and she fell behind in paying her bills. These circumstances were \nbeyond her control. She subsequently addressed and paid some of the bills. From 2001 \nto 2005, she failed to file her federal and state income tax returns on time. She did not \naddress her tax problems until she attempted to file bankruptcy and they became an \nissue. She eventually filed her delinquent returns in 2007. Some of the conditions \nregarding he finances were beyond her control and raise the application of mitigating \ncondition (b). However, her failure to file her federal income tax returns was within her \ncontrol. In order for mitigating condition (b) to be fully applicable, Applicant must have \nacted responsibly under the circumstances. Applicant continued to ignore her \nobligations to file her federal tax returns for six years. She did not address her taxes \nuntil she was thwarted from filing for bankruptcy. Her conduct continued for years, \ndespite her admission that she was aware of her legal obligation to file her taxes on \ntime. Exacerbating the problem was the fact she did not have any taxes withheld from \nher income while she was employed. Although she has been working with the IRS to \nresolve her problems, she did not notify them when she went back to work in \nSeptember 2009, to begin payments. She owes more than $61,000 with interest and \npenalties continuing to accrue. Applicant has other debts that also have not been \nresolved. Applicant did not act responsibly under the circumstances because she \n\n \n10 \n \n \nignored her tax obligations for six years. Therefore, I find mitigating condition (b) only \npartially applies.  \n \n \nApplicant stated she received financial counseling and she has a budget. \nApplicant has delinquent debts that are not resolved and her federal tax debt remains \nsignificant and unpaid. I find there are not clear indications the problem is being \nresolved. Although she has been cooperative with the IRS and mentioned a payment \nplan, nothing has been implemented and no payments have been made, other than two \nprevious payments totaling $150 .Applicant was working for several months and did not \nbegin making payments. At this juncture, she has not made a good-faith effort to resolve \nher delinquent debts or made progress in reducing her tax debt. It is too early to \nconclude that the problem is resolved or under control. I find mitigating conditions (c) \nand (d) do not apply.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant left federal employment \nand entered the real estate business. Due to economic conditions, the sale of real \nestate decreased and affected her financial stability. She also experienced serious \nmedical issues that prevented her from working for a period of time, along with the \ntermination of a ten-year relationship and incurrence of additional living expenses. \nThese factors impacted her ability to pay her debts on time. The most serious and \nsignificant debt is her delinquent taxes. Applicant failed to act responsibly in filing her \nfederal and state income tax returns for six years. Although, her personal situation may \nhave contributed to an initial delay, she later failed to comply and ignored her \nresponsibility after she obtained employment and her health improved. At this time, the \nrecord evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and \n\n \n11 \n \n \nsuitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant failed to \nmitigate the security concerns arising under the guideline for Financial Considerations.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.h: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nCarol G.

DOHA took action under Executive Order\n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as\namended; Department of Defense (DOD) Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial\nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended\n(Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) effective within the DOD on September\n1, 2006. \nIn a March 23, 2010, response, Applicant admitted nine of the ten allegations\nraised in the SOR under Guideline F. He also requested a hearing before a DOHA\nadministrative judge. DOHA assigned the case to me on October 20, 2010. The parties\nproposed a hearing date of December 16, 2010. A notice setting that date for the\nhearing was issued on November 5, 2010. I convened the hearing as scheduled. \nApplicant gave testimony, introduced four witnesses, and offered three\ndocuments, which were accepted into the record without objection as exhibits (Ex.) A-C.\nHe was given through December 27, 2010, to submit any additional documents. The\nFebruary 28, 2011\n\n Tr. 48. Applicant does not receive medical or disability payments for his condition.\n      1\n Id.\n      2\n2\nGovernment introduced 8 documents, which were accepted into the record without\nobjection as Exs. 1-8. The transcript (Tr.) of the proceeding was received on December\n29, 2010. In the interim, on December 16, 2010, Applicant forwarded two additional\ndocuments to Department Counsel. On December 29, 2010, Department Counsel\nforwarded those documents to me without objection. On December 30, 2010, they were\naccepted into the record as Exs. D-E and the record was closed. Based on a review of\nthe testimony, submissions, and exhibits, I find Applicant met his burden of mitigating\nsecurity concerns related to financial considerations. Clearance is granted.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 36-year-old proposal developer who has worked for the same\ngovernment contractor since June 2007. He is completing a bachelor\u2019s degree in\nbusiness and program management and is a certified motorcycle repairman. Applicant\nhas one minor child with a former spouse. He is currently separated from his present\nwife, with whom he also has a young child.\nApplicant joined the U.S. Army in 1995. In 1998, he married his first wife. The\ncouple ultimately had a child. While serving abroad in 2001, he contracted tuberculosis\nand was sent back to the United States for medical treatment. In 2002, he prepared for\ndeployment, but he did not have the lung capacity to adequately support operations at\nhis projected post. The decision was made to have Applicant medically separated from\nthe Army. He received a medical discharge in March 2003 at the rank of staff sergeant.1\nIn the interim, in June 2002, Applicant divorced his first wife and married his present\nspouse. At the time of his discharge, Applicant and his new wife earned approximately\n$50,000 per year, plus military benefits.\nBy April 2003, Applicant was enrolled in a 14-month motorcycle mechanics\ncertification program while his new wife was serving at a post in another state. They\nrelied on his wife\u2019s income, while Applicant was only receiving his GI Bill benefits and\nearning about $20,000 a year doing motorcycle repair work when jobs were available.\nIn retrospect, Applicant concedes that he did not adjust well to their reduced income.  In\n2005, his wife separated from the military, joined Applicant, and, after four or five\nmonths of unemployment, enrolled in college. Later that year, the couple had a child,\nwhich further stressed their finances. Applicant also attended college from 2006 until\n2007. Between 2003 and 2007, the couple acquired some debts.2\nIn June 2007, Applicant accepted a position with his current employer. Regular\nemployment helped stabilize Applicant\u2019s finances. In 2008, the couple separated and\ndecided to live apart. Applicant\u2019s wife kept primary custody of their child and Applicant\nprovided for the child regularly. In the summer of 2009, Applicant prepared to go\noverseas for a work assignment after receiving a promotion and a significant pay raise.\nWith this increase, he was able to meet all of his financial obligations without undue\n\n Tr. 30.\n      3\n Id.\n      4\n Tr. 31.

He worked with his estranged wife to devise a strategy to address their\ndelinquent debts.  \n3\nIn December 2009, Applicant arrived at his overseas office. Before going abroad,\nhis parents agreed to receive wire transfers of money from him and make payments to\nhis various creditors on his behalf. In this manner, he hoped to \u201cstart the road to\nrecovery\u201d on his delinquent debts.  As noted below, many of the debts at issue in the\n4\n2010 SOR were included in the list of debts to be paid on his behalf by his parents. In\nthis manner, progress was made on many of Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts and his credit\nhas improved significantly. Applicant recently replaced a failing truck with another\nvehicle on favorable loan terms.5\nThe SOR was issued in January 2010 and received by Applicant in March 2010.\nIn the SOR, the following debts are at issue:\n1.a \u2013 Collection for $100 \u2013 Paid.  This county utility account was satisfied in February\n6\n2010.\n1.b \u2013 Collection for $25 \u2013 Paid.  This debt was for a returned check. The Government\n7\naccepted evidence excised from Applicant\u2019s bank statement that this debt was satisfied\nin February 2010.  It is no longer reflected on Applicant\u2019s credit report.\n8\n9\n1.c \u2013 Collection for $272 \u2013 Paid.  This utility bill was posted as paid by February 1,\n10\n2010.\n1.d \u2013 Collection for $801 \u2013 Paid.  Ths debt was disputed. It was ultimately settled in\n11\nMarch 2010 by payment of $640.92.\n1.e \u2013 Collection for $4,020 \u2013 Unaddressed.  This debt was incurred for tax preparation\n12\nservices used by both Applicant and his estranged wife. The couple is working at\n\n Tr. 38-39.\n      13\n Tr. 37-38; Ex. 5, supra, note 6.\n      14\n Id.; see also Applicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR, dated Mar. 23, 2010.\n      15\n Tr. 38-39.\n      16\n Id..\n      17\n Tr. 39-41.\n      18\n Ex.

If the couple cannot agree to a method for paying this debt jointly, Applicant\nwill make payments on the debt when he has satisfied the debt noted at 1.h, below.13\n1.f \u2013 Collection for $299 \u2013 Paid.  This debt was incurred because of an accidental\n14\noverpayment of Applicant\u2019s GI Bill benefits in January 2010. It was repaid by March\n2010. 15\n1.g \u2013 Collection for $5,324 \u2013 Unaddressed.  This debt was incurred for mechanic\u2019s\n16\ntools. Applicant plans to satisfy this debt after repayment of the debts noted at 1.e and\n1.h.17\n1.h \u2013 Collection for $18,239 \u2013 In repayment.  This account is for student loans.\n18\nApplicant has been in timely repayment under a student loan rehabilitation program\nsince August 2010, when he initiated monthly payments through automatic payroll\ndeduction.  \n19\n1.i  \u2013 Collection for $4,252 \u2013 Favorably addressed.  This debt was incurred for an\n20\napartment rented and maintained by Applicant\u2019s estranged wife during their\nseparation.  Applicant submitted a notarized roommate release form on the apartment\n21\nentity\u2019s letterhead, dated January 21, 2010, showing that Applicant had relinquished\npossession of the unit in June 2008 and forfeited his lease responsibilities and security\ndeposit to his estranged wife.  He also provided evidence that the apartment declined\n22\nto prosecute the issue, and that the court was poised to dismiss the matter against him\nabsent good cause shown.23\n1.j \u2013 Collection issue with health club resulting in Contempt of Court arrest warrant for\nfailure to provide financial records (debt satisfied in October 2008) \u2013 Issue\n\n Tr. 43.\n      24\n Ex.

Applicant and a former gym had a dispute over a balance\nallegedly owed after Applicant\u2019s pulmonary issues led him to quit his membership. The\nmatter went to court, but Applicant missed his court appearance because he was on\ntemporary military duty away from his home.  When he was informed as to why an\n24\narrest warrant was issued, he paid the outstanding January 2008 debt.25\nApplicant provides timely child support for his two children.  He is on amicable\n26\nterms with both mothers and there have never been any financial issues with his\nspouses. Applicant adheres to a flexible budget that permits him to meet his needs and\ndebts.  \n27\nApplicant\u2019s student loan rehabilitation program ends in May 2011, at which point\nhis monthly student loan payments (for SOR allegation \u00b6 1.h) will be reduced\nsignificantly. He plans on using the differential funds to satisfy the two debts referenced\nin the SOR that have yet to be paid (SOR allegations \u00b6\u00b6 1.e and 1.g).  In order to\n28\nmaximize his ability to pay his debts, Applicant is not currently maintaining a savings\naccount or contributing to his company\u2019s 401k. He received financial counseling in\n2010, both formally and from professional peers. He sought to consolidate his\nremaining debts under one repayment schedule with one counseling group. Through no\nfault of his own, he was deemed ineligible to participate in its program.  \n29\nIn addressing his debts, Applicant used a specific strategy.  The debt owed for\n30\nthe apartment (SOR allegation \u00b6 1.i) and the gym (SOR allegation \u00b6 1.j) were\naddressed in 2008. He turned his attention to the rest of his debts when he received his\nlate-2009 pay raise. The majority of the remainder of his debts were addressed in 2010,\nwith about half addressed prior to Applicant\u2019s receipt of the SOR in March 2010.\nApplicant specifically planned to initially pay those debts he could first afford to pay,\nthen apply the amounts used on the satisfied debts toward his remaining debts. In the\ninterim, he entered the student loan rehabilitation program to get a better interest rate\non those loans and to reduce his monthly payments. Most of his progress was made\nafter December 2009, when he went abroad for work and began directing his mother to\nmake payments from his salary on his behalf.  Having successfully addressed eight of\n31\n\n See also ISCR Case No. 94-1075 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Aug. 10, 1995).\n      32\n ISCR Case No. 93-1390 at 7-8 (App. Bd. Jan. 27, 1995).\n      33\n6\nthe 10 debts noted in the SOR between 2008 and 2010, he is resolved to satisfy his two\nremaining debts (SOR allegations \u00b6\u00b6 1.e and 1.g) as expeditiously as possible.\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, an\nadministrative judge must consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations\nfor each guideline, the AG list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating\nconditions. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. Under AG \u00b6 2(c), this\nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-\nperson concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all reliable information about\nthe person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based\non the evidence contained in the record.\nThe Government must present evidence to establish controverted facts alleged\nin the SOR. An applicant is responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to\nrebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by\nDepartment Counsel. . . .\u201d  The burden of proof is something less than a\n32\npreponderance of evidence. The ultimate burden of persuasion is on the applicant.  \n33\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration\nof the possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard\nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible\nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified\ninformation.\nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \u201cThe clearly consistent standard\nindicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of\n\n Id.\n      34\n Id.\n      35\n AG \u00b6 18.\n      36\n Id.\n      37\n7\ndenials.\u201d  Any reasonable doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access\n34\nto sensitive information must be resolved in favor of protecting such sensitive\ninformation.35\nBased upon my consideration of the evidence, Guideline F (Financial\nConsiderations) is  the most pertinent to this case. Conditions pertaining to this AG that\ncould raise a security concern and may be disqualifying, as well as those which would\nmitigate such concerns, are set forth and discussed below.\nAnalysis\nGuideline F - Financial Considerations \nUnder Guideline F, \u201cfailure or an inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy\ndebts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about\nan individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information.\u201d  It\n36\nalso states that \u201can individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to\nengage in illegal acts to generate funds.\u201d  Following Applicant\u2019s medical discharge\n37\nfrom the Army, a period of underemployment, a reduction in his wife\u2019s salary, childbirth,\nand an inability to adjust to his reduced income led to Applicant\u2019s acquisition of\ndelinquent debt between 2005 and 2009. While the majority of those debts have since\nbeen paid, addressed, or put into repayment, two debts remain unaddressed. Such\nfacts are sufficient to raise Financial Considerations Disqualifying Condition (FC DC)\nAG \u00b6 19(a) (inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts) and FC DC AG \u00b6 19(c) (a history\nof not meeting financial obligations). With such conditions raised, it is left to Applicant to\novercome the case against him and mitigate security concerns. \nThe debts at issue are multiple in number. The majority of those debts were\naddressed within the past year. Applicant concedes that many of his earlier financial\nproblems were the result of his inability to adjust to his reduced income. Although\nApplicant is now more mature and in better financial circumstances, there is insufficient\nevidence to raise Financial Considerations Mitigating Condition (FC MC) AG \u00b6 20(a)\n(the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such\ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s\ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment). \nApplicant concedes that he did not adjust well to his reduced financial situation\nafter he was medically discharged from the Army for a pulmonary issue. His finances\nwere further hindered through a period of underemployment as a mechanic, his\n\n8\nestranged wife\u2019s period of unemployment after she was discharged from the military in\n2005, childbirth, 2008 separation, and the maintenance of separate residences. Each\nfactor contributed to Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties. Notwithstanding these obstacles,\nApplicant was able to address two debts in 2008, then start an aggressive strategy to\naddress the remainder of his debts in December 2009, after he received a pay raise\nthat enabled him to pay for more than his monthly essentials. Such facts are sufficient\nto raise FC MC AG \u00b6 20(b) (the conditions that resulted in the behavior were largely\nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn,\nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation) and the individual\nacted responsibly under the circumstances).\nApplicant has received financial counseling, both formally and through working\nwith professional peers to help address his debts. He devised a strategy to address\nthose debts. He also adopted a flexible budget that permitted him to make progress on\nhis debts while staying within budget. Eight of the 10 debts at issue have been\naddressed, and there is a clear plan for addressing the remaining two debts in a similar\nfashion. His credit score has improved and he is currently living within his means. He\nhas both the resolve and the resources to complete his strategy to address his debts.\nFC MC AG \u00b6 20(c) (the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control)\nand FC MC AG \u00b6 20(d), (the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue\ncreditors or otherwise resolve debts) apply. None of the other FC MCs apply.\nThe burden for mitigation in these proceedings is placed squarely on Applicant.\nThis case is not one of an individual investing in risky ventures or indulging in luxuries.\nIn his 20s, he contracted tuberculosis, a condition that unexpectedly led him to be\nmedically discharged from the Army. Unprepared for the workforce and with little\ntraining, he tried to make a living as a motorcycle mechanic, then attended college in\norder to pursue a career. Meanwhile, his marriage soured and debts were incurred.\nSince 2008, Applicant has worked diligently to rise in his area of expertise.\nConsequently, his salary has also risen. Two debts were addressed in 2008, with the\nmajority of the remainder of his delinquent debts addressed through a strategy first\nemployed in December 2009. By the time he received the SOR, he had begun work on\nover half of the debts at issue. Continuing with that strategy today, he has made\nsignificant progress on his debts and articulated a viable plan for addressing the\nbalance of the debt owed. The AG does not require that all one\u2019s delinquent debts must\nbe paid. It only requires that an applicant establish a reasonable plan to resolve the\ndebts, and that the applicant has taken meaningful actions to implement the plan. Here,\nApplicant has shown a workable and successful approach to addressing his debts that\nis suitable to his income and circumstances. I find that financial considerations security\nconcerns are mitigated.\nWhole-Person Concept\nUnder the whole-person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of an applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2 (a). Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate\n\n9\ndetermination of whether to grant a security clearance must be an overall\ncommonsense judgment based on careful consideration of the guidelines and the\nwhole-person concept. In addition, what constitutes reasonable behavior in such cases,\nas contemplated by FC MC \u00b6 20(b), depends on the specific facts in a given case. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case, as well as the \u201cwhole-person\u201d\nfactors. Applicant is a highly credible and candid 36-year-old proposal developer who\nhas worked for the same government contractor for over three years. His goal of\nserving this country through military service was cut short by a medical condition\nbeyond his control. Medically discharged, divorced, and without a career to fall back on,\nhe sought training to become a certified motorcycle mechanic, but the work proved to\nbe insufficiently lucrative. He attended college, then accepted a job with his current\nemployer, where he has risen in rank and salary over the past three years. During that\nperiod, he worked to address his delinquent debts as best he could within his income.\nDomestically, he has remained on amicable terms with his ex-wife and his estranged\nsecond wife. He has made timely child support a priority, and there is no indication that\nspousal assistance or child support has ever been an issue.  \nUsing knowledge gained from financial counseling and more seasoned peers,\nApplicant developed a strategy to address his delinquent debts.  With the help of his\nparents, who acted on his behalf while he was working abroad, Applicant has\naddressed all but two of the 10 debts at issue. Most of those debts were addressed\nbefore he received the SOR. He has been timely in his student loan rehabilitation\nprogram and he has a workable strategy to satisfy his two remaining debts. While he\nmay have been somewhat lackadaisical about his finances when he was freshly\ndischarged from the military, he has matured and shown an increasing appreciation of\nthe need for good credit. Having recently reaped the rewards of his improved credit with\na necessary automotive purchase, he is resolved to complete his plan successfully. \nOverall, Applicant has demonstrated a rising sense of responsibility\ncommensurate with personal maturation and increased resources. His success over the\npast year has been impressive. He showed that he has established and executed a\nreasonable and methodical plan to resolve his debts successfully. I conclude that\nApplicant is exhibiting responsible behavior and I have no concerns that he will fail to\nsimilarly honor his two remaining debts. Given all these considerations, there is\nsufficient evidence to mitigate Guideline F security concerns. Clearance is granted.      \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.j:\nFor Applicant\n\n10\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with national interest to grant Applicant a security clearance.\nClearance granted.\n__________________________\nARTHUR E.

He also took three\nrequired polygraph exams due to areas of concern. (Tr. 101.)\nDuring an SCI interview in April 2007, Applicant reported that he had driven on\nnumerous occasions while intoxicated, although he was never formally charged or\nconvicted of a Driving Under the Influence (DUI) or Driving While Intoxicated (DWI). (Tr.\n164; GE 5.) He indicated during the interview that he was probably over the legal blood\nalcohol limit to drive, but the police officers decided not to arrest him. Applicant reported\nthat since approximately 1978, he consumed, on the average, one or two alcoholic\n\n3\nbeverages a day. At that time, he did not believe he had an alcohol problem, although\nhis wife had mentioned to him on several occasions that she felt there was a problem\ndue to his daily drinking habit. As a result of the interview, he was referred to a\npsychologist. (Tr. 191.) \nIn an August 20, 2007 interview, Applicant was further questioned about his\nalcohol use. He reported he currently consumes one beer and a glass of wine with\ndinner every other day. He could not recall the last time he was intoxicated. (GE 4.)\nDuring that interview, he also reported that \u201che felt bad about his disclosure to the\nmedia\u201d in 2000, because he did not use \u201cthe proper chain of command.\u201d Applicant\nemphasized that the information was not classified. (GE 4.)\nA third SCI interview was conducted in November 2007. Applicant answered\nmore questions concerning his alcohol use. He reported that it took approximately\nseven drinks consumed over a two-three-hour period, for him to become intoxicated.\n(GE 4.) He estimated that he consumed alcohol to the point of intoxication five times per\nyear in the past five years. He acknowledged that on October 29, 2007, he consumed\nfour to five alcoholic drinks in a two or three hour period. He planned to take a taxi\nbecause he felt intoxicated, but there were no taxis. He then decided to drive his car to\nreturn to his hotel. (GE 4.) He further explained that he dismissed his wife\u2019s concern\nover his excessive use of alcohol in the past years. He denied having any problem with\nalcohol.\nAs a result of the discussions concerning Applicant\u2019s alcohol use, he was\nrequested to complete a psychological evaluation. In November 2007, a diagnosis of\nalcohol abuse by a government psychologist was made. He suggested that Applicant\nstop drinking. (Tr. 105.) The evaluation also revealed a history of failing to conform his\nbehavior to social norms. The psychologist opined that Applicant\u2019s long history of\ndecision-making is based on a risk/benefit ratio or on the likelihood that he will be\ncaught. (GE 4.) The agency psychologist rated Applicant a high risk for future instances\nof poor judgment, irresponsibility, and impulsivity.\nIt was not until his SCI investigation in 2007, that Applicant acknowledged that he\nintentionally \u201cleaked\u201d information to the media due to his frustrations with his military\nsuperiors (GE 4). He later acknowledged in 2007 that it was a mistake, and he should\nhave \u201cstaffed it internally.\u201d He expressed regret for his decision, despite the fact that it\nwas not classified information. He felt that it was not the \u201ccompany-man\u201d thing to do. (Tr.\n120.) He also admitted that he would never have told anyone at the time that he went\nthrough this unusual channel. He rationalized his decision because it was not\nspecifically against any Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ) article. (Tr.120.)\nIn January 2008, Applicant was denied his SCI clearance by another agency in\npart due to concerns about alcohol consumption and personal conduct. The decision\nconcluded that Applicant has proven an unwillingness to follow laws, rules, and\nregulations. It cited him for a long history of questionable decision-making. (GE 4.)\n\n4\nIn March 2008, Applicant requested a review (first level appeal) of the denial.\n(GE 7.) His appeal was reviewed. (GE 8.) In that review, it was noted that a concern\nwas that Applicant \u201cdecided that the rules pertaining to others should not pertain to him.\u201d\n(GE 8.) On June 10, 2008, the appeal was denied, and the original decision was\nsustained. (GE 9). Applicant did not appeal the decision further because he did not\nbelieve his DoD clearance would be affected. (Tr.101.) Applicant also explained that the\nnext appeal would occur before a panel of five, and to overturn the decision, there\nwould need to be a five-to-zero-vote. (Tr 189.)\nIn a September 2008 interview with OPM, Applicant reported that he \u201cwanted to\nfully disclose any possible security issues, including using illegal drugs. He wanted to be\nperfectly honest.\u201d He stated that the incidents from more than 20 years ago had been\ndiscussed in previous investigations in 1984, 1991, 1996, and 2002. (GE 3.)\nIn a November 2008 interview, Applicant reported to DOHA that an issue arose\nrelated to his alcohol use during his 2007 SCI investigation. When asked if he ever\nconsumed alcohol over the legal limit in the last 20 years, Applicant responded\n\u201capproximately one time per year.\u201d (GE 3.) He told the interviewer that he did not\nbelieve that he had a problem with alcohol. He has not sought any additional counseling\nconcerning alcohol.\nIn a March 2009 statement to accompany DOHA interrogatories, Applicant\nadmitted that he did not disclose any drug use during previous investigations. He\ndisclosed the use for the first time during the SCI interview in 2007. He also\nacknowledged that he had used illegal drugs while holding a security clearance in the\n1980s. He acknowledged the use in the investigation and interviews since 2007, but he\ndid not disclose any of the illegal drug use on any of his security clearance applications.\n(Tr. 157.) He also changed his statement concerning the 2000 email to the reporter.\nApplicant reported that he did not even receive a response after sending the email. (GE\n3.)\nIn February 2010, Applicant was evaluated by a psychologist who administered a\nmental status exam and a Substance Abuse Subtle Screening Inventory (SASSI-2).The\npsychologist opined that Applicant did not have an \u201cactive diagnosis of substance abuse\nor dependence.\u201d He completed a clinical interview and determined that alcohol has not\nimpacted Applicant\u2019s personal, social, or interpersonal relationships since 2007. (AE E.)\nAt the hearing, Applicant acknowledged that he consumed alcohol on a daily\nbasis until at least November 2007. (Tr. 158). However, when he was aboard ship, there\nwas no alcohol use. When not aboard ship, he said he had a beer on most days.\nApplicant believed that he has driven after drinking but he did not know whether he was\nover the \u201clegal\u201d limit. However, in his statement during his 2007 interview , he\n\u201cestimated that he has consumed alcohol to the point of intoxication five times per year\nin the past five years.\u201d He has driven while under the influence of alcohol on\napproximately three occasions in the past five years. The last such occasion occurred\non October 29, 2007. (GE 4.) He also introduced a blood alcohol concentration\n\n5\ncalculator (AE B) to show that given his weight and the amount of alcohol that he drank\nin the past, he would not have risen to the legal limit for intoxication.\nApplicant has not attended any counseling sessions for excessive alcohol\nconsumption. He claimed that he went to a VA hospital before preparing for the hearing\nto have an assessment. (Tr 177.) He also acknowledged that the 2007 diagnosis was a\nwake-up call, but he did not stop drinking. He also admitted that his wife had mentioned\nthe issue many times but he discounted her opinion. (Tr. 193.) He does monitor his\nalcohol intake before driving. (Tr. 196.) Since January 2010, he has not had any alcohol\nto drink. He explained that this was due to his diet. He still drives after drinking alcohol.\n(Tr. 107.)\nAt the hearing, when questioned, Applicant stated that he admits that he filled out\nnumerous security questionnaires, but never put down his drug use of more than 20\nyears ago on any security clearance applications. He knew that was a violation of\nUCMJ. He elaborated that he would have been basically admitting that he lied on the\nprevious applications. (Tr. 199.)\nApplicant\u2019s twenty-three-year friend, who has a distinguished Naval career,\ndescribes Applicant as a trustworthy person. However, he noted that the incident with\nthe journalist \u201cdid not show the most mature judgment, and that Applicant could have\nused his chain of command more effectively.\u201d (Tr. 38.) He believes that Applicant\nexercises moderation in alcohol use and does not combine drinking and driving. (Tr.\n30.) In sum, he describes Applicant\u2019s previous military and civilian experience as\nsomething of value. (Tr. 38.)\nA Navy colleague considers Applicant an honest person. He expressed some\nconcern, as a friend, about Applicant and his \u201cexercise of alcohol (diagnosis of alcohol\nabuse.\u201d Applicant\u2019s colleague does not believe that he would compromise national\nintegrity or any means of security. (Tr. 56.) However, Applicant\u2019s colleague was clear\nthat the use of the email in 2000 should have gone through a higher level within the\nNavy. (Tr. 53.)\nApplicant\u2019s 1984 flight instructor remembers him as an \u201coutstanding student.\u201d (Tr.\n73.) In 1995, Applicant had daily contact with his former instructor in a squadron.\nApplicant is described as a person with a strong performance record \u201cwho thinks out of\nthe box.\u201d His longtime associate has never seen Applicant intoxicated in social\nsituations. Applicant is described as a \u201ctop performer in the Navy\u201d who can be trusted.\n(Tr. 80.) He recommends him for a security clearance.\nApplicant submitted numerous letters of reference and commendations, including\na September 2000 designation as Battle Watch Captain. (AE C). This designation was\nin place when Applicant sent the email to the reporter. He submitted various\nqualifications and fitness reports. (AE I). Applicant was consistently described as a\nsuperb Naval officer. He stated that he never received any reprimands or disciplinary\nactions during his military career. \n\n6\nApplicant\u2019s current employer regards him as an outstanding member of the team.\n(AE G.) He states Applicant does a superb job and has his complete trust and\nconfidence. He also states he has seen Applicant socially on many occasions and that\nhe has never observed any behavior that would cause him to question Applicant\u2019s\nconduct, judgment, or integrity.  \nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief\nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially\ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which must be considered in\nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2,\nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the\n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable\ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a\ndecision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship\ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government\nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk\nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information.\nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to\npotential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.\n \n\n7\nSection 7 of Executive Order (EO) 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin\nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty\nof the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple\nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).\nAnalysis\nGuideline E, Personal Conduct\nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern pertaining to personal conduct:\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful\nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other\nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\nThe following will normally result in an unfavorable clearance action or\nadministrative termination of further processing for clearance eligibility:\n(a) refusal, or failure without reasonable cause, to undergo or cooperate\nwith security processing, including but not limited to meeting with a\nsecurity investigator for subject interview, completing security forms or\nreleases, and cooperation with medical or psychological evaluation; and,\n(b) refusal to provide full, frank and truthful answers to lawful questions of\ninvestigators, security officials, or other official representatives in\nconnection with a personnel security or trustworthiness determination.\nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be\ndisqualifying:\n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from\nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or\nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment\nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance\neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities;\n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information concerning\nrelevant facts to an employer, investigator, security official, competent\nmedical authority, or other official government representative;\n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is\nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single\nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-\n\n8\nperson \nassessment \nof \nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness,\nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and\nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the person may not\nproperly safeguard protected information;\n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any\nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse\ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information\nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment,\nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply\nwith rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the\nperson may not properly safeguard protected information. This includes\nbut is not limited to consideration of:\n(1) untrustworthy or unreliable behavior to include breach of\nclient confidentiality, release of proprietary information,\nunauthorized release of sensitive corporate or other\ngovernment protected information:\n(2) disruptive, violent, or other inappropriate behavior in the\nworkplace; \n(3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations; and,\n(4) evidence of significant misuse of Government or other\nemployer's time or resources.\n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one's conduct,\nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress, such\nas (1) engaging in activities which, if known, may affect the person's\npersonal, professional, or community standing, or (2) while in another\ncountry, engaging in any activity that is illegal in that country or that is\nlegal in that country but illegal in the United States and may serve as a\nbasis for exploitation or pressure by the foreign security or intelligence\nservice or other group;\n(f) violation of a written or recorded commitment made by the individual to\nthe employer as a condition of employment; and,\n(g) association with persons involved in criminal activity. \nIn 2000, Applicant decided to send an email to a national security reporter\nbecause he was frustrated with his military supervisor\u2019s policy. He did not tell anyone\nabout this action. Despite the fact that it was not classified information, it showed a\ndisregard for following his chain of command. Applicant acknowledged in 2007, during\nan SCI investigation, that he intentionally \u201cleaked\u201d information to the media due to his\n\n9\nfrustrations. He felt bad about the disclosure and acknowledged recently that it was not\na good decision. He knew he was circumventing the chain of command in the Navy, but\nhe chose to act on his own accord. The appropriate manner of responding was to inform\nhis chain of command of what he was doing and not by covertly sending an email to a\nreporter.\nApplicant admitted using poor judgment on numerous occasions when he felt\nintoxicated and decided to drive a car. As a result, he was involved in an auto accident\nin 2004. \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns:\n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission,\nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts;\n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was\ncaused or significantly contributed to by improper or inadequate advice of\nauthorized personnel or legal counsel advising or instructing the individual\nspecifically concerning the security clearance process. Upon being made\naware of the requirement to cooperate or provide the information, the\nindividual cooperated fully and truthfully.\n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is\nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is\nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability,\ntrustworthiness, or good judgment;\n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling\nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the\nstressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable,\nor other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur;\n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate\nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress;\n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable\nreliability; and,\n(g) association with persons involved in criminal activity has ceased or\noccurs under circumstances that do not cast doubt upon the individual's\nreliability, trustworthiness, judgment, or willingness to comply with rules\nand regulations.\nThe email incident was in 2000. Applicant, however, did not reveal the incident\nuntil he was in an SCI investigation. He now acknowledges that it was a poor decision\nand has some regret. However, he never disclosed this information before he was\n\n10\nconfronted in 2007. Although it was not classified information, it showed a disregard for\nthe chain of command. Applicant acted out of frustration. He did not show good\njudgment.\nAlthough Applicant never received any speeding violations while living in\nDenmark, he admitted during his SCI investigation that he did speed while on the\noutlying freeways. \nApplicant also chose to use poor judgment after drinking on numerous\noccasions. This conduct will be discussed under Guideline G. However, it does reflect\non his ability to use good judgment over the years.\nAlthough not specifically alleged conduct and not considered under Guideline H\n(drug involvement), Applicant\u2019s failure to tell his employer - the Navy - about his illegal\ndrug use (including while holding a security clearance) on any security clearance\napplications is quite troubling. This lack of disclosure undermines his credibility and\njudgment. At the hearing, he acknowledged that he knew that not reporting this was a\nviolation of the UCMJ. He also admitted that if he ever listed the early, and now\nirrelevant drug use, it would acknowledge that he lied during his entire career.\nApplicant acknowledged that throughout his military career he never disclosed\nany information about his early drug use to the military. It was not until 2007, that\nApplicant chose to disclose the instances of illegal drug use, including use while holding\na security clearance. In 2008, Applicant told OPM interviewers that he wanted to be\ntotally honest but he then acknowledged at the hearing that he never disclosed any of\nthe drug use because it would have shown that he lied in the numerous applications. He\nchose to disregard the rules.  \nApplicant\u2019s stellar Navy career and his character references weigh in his favor.\nHowever, the witnesses and the references could not have known about Applicant\u2019s\ndeliberate failure to disclose material information. No one knew until 2007 about any of\nthe above described incidents. I have considered that he has never been arrested,\ncharged or disciplined in his lengthy career. He has not mitigated personal conduct\nsecurity concerns.\nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption\nAG \u00b6 21 expresses the security concern pertaining to alcohol consumption,\n\u201cExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment or\nthe failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about an individual's reliability\nand trustworthiness.\u201d\nAG \u00b6 22 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be\ndisqualifying:\n\n11\n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under\nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or\nother incidents of concern, regardless of whether the individual is\ndiagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent;\n(b) alcohol-related incidents at work, such as reporting for work or duty in\nan intoxicated or impaired condition, or drinking on the job, regardless of\nwhether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol\ndependent;\n(c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired\njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol\nabuser or alcohol dependent;\n(d) diagnosis by a duly qualified medical professional (e.g., physician,\nclinical psychologist, or psychiatrist) of alcohol abuse or alcohol\ndependence;\n(e) evaluation of alcohol abuse or alcohol dependence by a licensed\nclinical social worker who is a staff member of a recognized alcohol\ntreatment program;\n(f) relapse after diagnosis of alcohol abuse or dependence and completion\nof an alcohol rehabilitation program; and\n(g) failure to follow any court order regarding alcohol education,\nevaluation, treatment, or abstinence.\nApplicant admitted that in 2004, after drinking, he was involved in an accident.\nHe admitted that the alcohol was probably a factor in the accident. He has never\nreceived a charge or conviction for DUI, but Applicant has admitted driving when he\nbelieved he had too much to drink. The latest incident was in October 2007. Applicant\nnever considered that he had an alcohol problem, despite the fact that his wife\nmentioned it numerous times over the years. \nApplicant\u2019s self-described drinking habits prompted a referral for an alcohol\nevaluation in November 2007. He received a diagnosis of alcohol abuse. He chose not\nto stop drinking even though it was suggested. He sought no treatment between 2007\nand 2010. He did acknowledge that the diagnosis was a wake-up call. He curtailed his\nconsumption of alcohol. Since January 2010, Applicant has not had any alcohol to drink,\nbut he is abstaining for dietary purposes. He still intends to drink in the future. \nIn February 2010, Applicant was evaluated by another psychologist, who\ndetermined that based on the evaluation and SASSI, Applicant does not have an active\ndiagnosis of alcohol abuse or dependence. The psychologist opined that Applicant is in\nsustained full remission. \n\n12\nApplicant\u2019s friends who have observed him socially did not report that he drank to\nintoxication. He never had any problems at work. He has never received a DUI or DWI.  \nAG \u00b6 23 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns:\n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it\nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or\ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness,\nor good judgment;\n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her alcoholism or issues of alcohol\nabuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and\nhas established a pattern of abstinence (if alcohol dependent) or\nresponsible use (if an alcohol abuser);\n(c) the individual is a current employee who is participating in a counseling\nor treatment program, has no history of previous treatment and relapse,\nand is making satisfactory progress; and\n(d) the individual has successfully completed inpatient or outpatient\ncounseling or rehabilitation along with any required aftercare, has\ndemonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or\nabstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations, such as\nparticipation in meetings of Alcoholics Anonymous or a similar\norganization and has received a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified\nmedical professional or a licensed clinical social worker who is a staff\nmember of a recognized alcohol treatment program.\nApplicant has changed his drinking habits. He curtailed his consumption since\nthe diagnosis in 2007. He is now in sustained full remission according to a psychologist.\nHe believes he has had a wake-up call. He recognizes that it is imprudent to drink and\ndrive, but he does continue to do so. Other than seeing the psychologist in 2010 on two\nseparate occasions, Applicant has not had any alcohol-related counseling.  Applicant\nhas mitigated the security concerns under alcohol consumption.\nWhole-Person Concept\nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2)\nthe circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency\nof the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the\n\n13\ntime of the conduct; (5) the extent to which participation is\nvoluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and\nother permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for\nthe conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion,\nexploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation\nor recurrence.\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \n   \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case and conclude they are insufficient to\novercome the government\u2019s case. \nApplicant is a well-educated professional. He served in the Navy for 25 years. He\nheld security clearances, including SCI since 1984. He has favorable recommendations\nand fitness reports. His Navy colleagues respect and trust him. He has never been\nreprimanded while in the military. His current civilian employer considers him an\noutstanding employee. He has never been charged or convicted of a DUI.  He has\nchanged his drinking habits since his 2007 diagnosis of alcohol abuse. He has a 2010\ndiagnosis of sustained alcohol abuse in full remission.\nApplicant\u2019s personal conduct and disregarding rules and regulations is troubling.\nHe admitted that it was a bad decision to send an email to a reporter in 2000. He\nunderstands that it was not proper to secretly send an email with operational\nconnotations without clearing it first with his command. Applicant also chose not to\ndisclose his early illegal drug use (including while holding a security clearance) until\n2007 during an SCI investigation. Even more disturbing is the admission that Applicant\nmade at the hearing that he never disclosed any early drug use on his many security\nclearance applications. He knew that it would be a problem and would confirm that he\nhad lied during his career to the Navy. \nAs to conduct not alleged in the SOR, the Appeal Board has determined that it\nmay be considered for several reasons. It may be considered to assess an applicant\u2019s\ncredibility; to evaluate an applicant\u2019s evidence of extenuation, mitigation, or changed\ncircumstances, to consider whether a particular provision of the Adjudicative Guidelines\nis applicable; or to provide evidence for whole-person analysis under Directive Section\n6.3. ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006) (citations omitted).\nAdditionally, the Appeal Board has determined that even though security\nconcerns are not alleged in the SOR, the judge may consider those security concerns\nwhen they are relevant and factually related to a disqualifying condition that was alleged\nin the SOR. ISCR 05-01820 at 3 n.4 (App. Bd. Dec. 14, 2006). Applicant received notice\nin SOR \u00b6 1.c concerning the reasons his SCI was denied, including \u201cdishonesty.\u201d I have\nconsidered Applicant\u2019s deliberate non-disclosure of his early illegal drug use on his\n\n14\nsecurity clearance applications for the limited purpose of determining whether he is\ncredible, whether his pattern of rule violations is mitigated under personal conduct, and\nas part of my whole-person analysis.\nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I\nconclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns arising under personal\nconduct. He has mitigated the security concerns under the alcohol guideline.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline E:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline G:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 2.a through 2.d:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is  not\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n                                              \n_________________\nNOREEN A. LYNCH\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Stevens, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nMASON, Paul J., Administrative Judge:\nBased on a review of the case file, pleadings, and exhibits, Applicant\u2019s eligibility\nfor a public trust position is denied.\nStatement of the Case\nApplicant submitted her Questionnaire for Public Trust Position (SF 85P, Item 5)\non June 25, 2008. On October 9, 2008, Applicant was interviewed by an investigator\nfrom the Office of Personnel Management (OPM). The primary issue of the interview\nwas her delinquent debts. On October 9, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and\nAppeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns\nunder financial considerations (Guideline F). The action was taken pursuant to\nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February\n20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial\nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended\n(Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President\non December 29, 2005, and made effective within the Department of Defense for SORs\nissued on or after September 1, 2006. \nMarch 30, 2010\n\n2\nApplicant submitted her answer to the SOR on October 28, 2009. She requested\na decision be made on the record in lieu of a hearing. A copy of the Government\u2019s File\nof Relevant Material (FORM, the government\u2019s evidence in support of the allegations of\nthe SOR) was sent to Applicant on November 19, 2009. Applicant received the FORM\non November 30, 2009. Her response was due on December 30, 2009. No response\nwas received. The case file was assigned to me on February 4, 2010. \nFindings of Fact\nThe SOR alleges 30 delinquent accounts totaling more than $36,848.00 under\nthe financial considerations guideline. The delinquent debts consist of credit cards,\npersonal loans, medical bills, and telephone accounts. The debts became delinquent\nbetween April 2002 and August 2008. Applicant admitted all the debts except for 1.f.,\n1.k., 1.n., 1.o., 1.v., 1.u., 1.w., and 1.cc., contending she did not recognize the debt or\nthat she had negotiated a settlement with the creditor. See, SOR 1.n. and 1.o.\nApplicant is 40 years old and single. She has been employed in a CA III position\nat a Blue Cross medical insurance facility since 2001 ( SF 85P, Item 5). \nOn October 9, 2008, Applicant was interviewed by an OPM investigator (Item 6).\nShe explained she encountered financial problems after moving from the northeast to\nher current residential location in 1999. She opened several credit cards and personal\nloans, but could not maintain the payments. She opened a debt consolidation loan in\nJune 2003 (SOR 1.k.), with her mother as co-signer. Applicant intended to use the\nfunds to pay off other delinquent debts. However, she could not maintain the payments\non the loan. Currently, the loan is listed in her mother\u2019s Chapter 13 bankruptcy petition\n(Id.).    \nItem 6 also contains another statement by Applicant, dated March 30, 2009,\nconcerning her financial difficulties. Applicant indicated she made poor choices with her\nfinances while raising two children as a single parent, but she has never done anything\nillegal. She stated that she loves her job and is dedicated to the mission of her\nemployer. Applicant then indicated that her attempts to resolve her financial situation\nshould be considered (Id.).\nIn additional interrogatory answers dated March 30, 2009 (Item 7), Applicant\nprovided a personal financial statement (PFS) indicating she had a negative monthly\nremainder of $587, after payment of her expenses. See also, Applicant\u2019s admission to\nSOR 1.ee. Following the PFS, Applicant submitted documentation from the two\ncreditors listed in SOR 1.b. and 1.dd. She wrote on the documentation that she had paid\nthe creditors. However, she supplied no receipts or bank statements showing that the\nbills had actually been paid.\nIn a supplemental statement attached to her answer to the SOR, dated October\n28, 2009, Applicant stated she has been employed in her position for nine years without\nan infraction, such as stealing or gambling. She noted that she established \u201csome\n\n3\npayment agreements\u201d with creditors, but presented no additional information. In her\nanswer to the SOR, she indicated she was paying $79 monthly to the creditor identified\nin SOR 1.n., and $79 a month to the same creditor for a second account identified in\nSOR 1.o. However, Applicant provided no actual documentation of payment to either\ncreditor. \nCharacter Evidence\nApplicant provided no character evidence regarding her job performance or her\nreputation in the community where she lives. \nPolicies\nOn April 9, 1993, the Composite Health Care Program Office (CHCSPO), the\nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), and the Assistant Secretary of\nDefense for Command, Control, Communications and Intelligence (ASDC3I), entered\ninto a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) which gave DOHA the responsibility to\nprovide trustworthiness determinations for contractor personnel working on unclassified\nInformation Systems Positions as defined in DOD Regulation 5200.2-R, Personnel\nSecurity Program, dated January 1987.\nTo be eligible for assignment to sensitive duties, an applicant must meet the\nsecurity guidelines contained in DoD 5200.2-R. \u201cThe standard that must be met for  . . .\nassignment to sensitive duties is that, based on all available information, the person\u2019s\nloyalty, reliability and trustworthiness are such that  . . .  assigning the person to\nsensitive duties is clearly consistent with the interests of national security.\u201d The\nRegulation sets forth personnel security guidelines, disqualifying and mitigating\nconditions under each guideline. In determining whether the applicant qualifies for a\nsensitive position under the trustworthiness standard, the applicant must be provided\nthe due process procedures contained in DoD Directive 5220.6.\nIn addition to the disqualifying and mitigating conditions of each security\nguideline, the general factors of the whole-person concept should be applied in deciding\nwhether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant an applicant eligibility\nfor assignment to sensitive duties. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a public trust position, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a public trust position. Recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s ultimate\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and commonsense decision. According to the AG,\nthe entire process is a careful, thorough evaluation of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available,\n\n4\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nAnalysis\nFinancial Considerations (FC)\nAG \u00b6 18 describes the security concerns under the financial considerations\nguideline:\nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in ilegal acts to generate funds. Compulsive gambling is a concern as it may lead to financial crimes including\nespionage. Affluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a\nsecurity concern. It may indicate proceeds from financially profitable criminal acts.\nThe financial guideline lists two disqualifying conditions that may be applicable to\nthis case:\nAG \u00b6 19(a) (inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts); and \nAG \u00b6 19(c) (a history of failing to meet financial obligations).\nApplicant explained in her interview that she began having financial problems\nafter opening several credit accounts and personal loans, and discovering she could not\nmaintain the payments. Between 2002 and August 2008, Applicant accumulated 30\ndelinquent debts totaling $36,848. AG \u00b6 19(a) applies to Applicant\u2019s inability to satisfy\nher debts. AG \u00b6 19(c) applies based Applicant\u2019s six-year history of not meeting financial\nobligations.\nFour conditions under AG \u00b6 20 could potentially mitigate Applicant\u2019s delinquent\nindebtedness:\nAG \u00b6 20(a) (the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or\noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not\n\n5\ncast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment); \nAG \u00b6 20(b) (the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were\nlargely beyond the person\u2019s control, and the person acted responsibly\nunder the circumstances); \nAG \u00b6 20(c) (the person has received or is receiving counseling for the\nproblem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being\nresolved or is under control); and\nAG \u00b6 20(d) (the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue\ncreditors or otherwise resolve debts).\n\u00b6 20(a) does not apply because of the large number of accounts that became\ndelinquent between 2002 and 2008. The lack of a plan to resolve her delinquent\naccounts continues to cast doubt on Applicant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and good\njudgment.\nIn order to receive credit under AG \u00b6 20(b), an applicant must show that\nunforeseen events prevented her from paying her debts. The record reflects that\nApplicant has been employed by her employer for the last nine years. She provided no\nevidence indicating she suffered an unexpected medical condition or some other\nproblem beyond her control that resulted in the financial problem. AG \u00b6 20(b) does not\napply.\nApplicant has not had financial counseling. Even if there was evidence of\ncounseling, AG \u00b6 20(c) still would not apply because Applicant has done nothing to\nimprove her financial situation. In addition, AG \u00b6 20(d) must be removed from\nconsideration because there is no evidence showing that any of the debts, even the\nsmaller debts, have been paid or settled. Applicant has failed to show that she is eligible\nfor a public trust position. \nWhole-Person Concept \nI have examined the evidence with the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in\nmy ultimate finding against Applicant under the financial guideline. I have also weighed\nthe circumstances within the context of nine variables known as the whole-person\nconcept. In evaluating the relevance of an individual\u2019s conduct, the administrative judge\nshould consider the following factors: \nAG \u00b6 2(a) (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich the participation was voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\n\n6\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and, (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nApplicant\u2019s nine years of uninterrupted employment with her employer since\n1991 without incident weighs in her favor. Her dedication to her children, her employer\nand her colleagues, also weighs in her favor. There is no evidence that she has a\ncriminal record or has ever violated proprietary rules. \nConversely, failing to pay voluntarily incurred debt demonstrates financial\nirresponsibility. Applicant has a lengthy history of financial problems, with some of her\ndelinquent debt more than six years old. She was informed in October 2008 that her\ndelinquent debts were a concern of the Government. In March 2009, she was advised a\nsecond time that the Government was concerned about her delinquent accounts.\nWithout evidence of a plan to deal with her delinquent debts, Applicant has not\nmitigated the Government\u2019s case under the financial considerations guideline. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1 (Financial Considerations, Guideline F): AGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a. through 1 ee.\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a public trust\nposition. Eligibility for access to a public trust position denied. \n                       \nPaul J. Mason\nAdministrative Judge\n",

(Ex. \nE)  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s performance assessments indicate Applicant is a major contributor, a \nquick learner, has a good attitude, and never complains. The assessments also indicate \nApplicant works hard and has exceeded expectations. (Ex. F)  \n \nIn August 2003, at the beginning of Applicant\u2019s senior year, he stopped at a \nconvenience store on his way to school. Applicant was 17 years old. (Ex. 4) Two friends \nwere with him when another individual, who had previously been a childhood friend, \nbegan yelling at him. An argument ensued. The other individual had earlier shown \nApplicant a pistol, which Applicant believed that person carried in his car. The other \nindividual had earlier threatened to shoot Applicant.

During the fight, the other individual\u2019s ankle was \nbroken.  \n \nApplicant was arrested and charged with battery in the second degree, a felony. \nIn August 2004, he was sentenced to five years probation and ordered to perform 400 \nhours of community service. In August 2009, Applicant\u2019s probation ended. )Ex. 2) \nApplicant was ordered to pay $11,854 restitution. In May 2006, Applicant started making \npayments on this debt. In August 2009, the debt was satisfied. (Ex. A, Tr. 34) The \ncommunity service was performed at local parks following Hurricane Katrina, at the \nAmerican Red Cross, and at the Salvation Army. (Tr. 64)  \n \nSince the incident, Applicant has talked to the other individual a few times. Their \nrelationship is civil, they talk, and have shaken hands, but their relationship will never be \nthat of friends. (Tr. 71) Applicant has been informed his felony conviction could be \nexpunged. Applicant has not been able to afford hiring an attorney to initiate the \nexpungement. (Tr. 49) \n \nSix years ago, in July 2004, Applicant got into a fight with his girlfriend. He had \ndated her since he was age 14. (Tr. 28) Applicant\u2014then age 18\u2014discovered another \nman\u2019s telephone number on his girlfriend\u2019s cell phone. (Ex. 5, page 3 of 6) Applicant \nwas upset, called his girlfriend\u2019s home phone early in the morning, and left some threats \non the answering machine. The following day, the two made up. (Ex. 2) In August 2004, \nApplicant was arrested for terroristic threatening, a felony. His girlfriend came with him \nto his court appearances for moral support. (Ex. 2, Tr. 16) When Applicant pleaded \nguilty to the 2004 battery charge, the terroristic threatening charge was nolle prosequi. \n(Ex. 5) Applicant and the woman have two children and are still together. (Tr. 30) His \nfirst son was born in March 2006 and his second son in 2009. (Tr. 40) \n \nIn September 2007, Applicant was arrested and charged with driving while \nintoxicated (DWI). He and two of his friends were visiting his parents. He had a few \nbeers while watching TV. He was the driver when he and his friends left to go to a party. \nHe was stopped by police for not having his lights on. (Tr. 36) A breath test revealed \n.080% blood alcohol content (BAC), which was the legal limit for DWI. After pleading \nguilty, he was fined $1,000, required to pay $305 court costs, and his driver\u2019s license \nwas restricted for four months. (Ex. 2, 6) Applicant was on probation when arrested for \nDWI. A condition of probation was to abstain from alcohol consumption. (Tr. 37) He \ninformed his probation officer of the incident. (Tr. 47)  \n \nApplicant\u2019s January 2010 credit bureau report (CBR) lists two unpaid medical \nbills in the amounts of $167 (SOR \u00b6 2.b) and $543 (SOR \u00b6 2.c). (Ex. 8) The CBR gives \nvery limited information about the debts and does not provide the creditor\u2019s name. \nApplicant denies owing these debts. He has not seen a doctor, received medical \ntreatment, or gone to an emergency room. (Tr. 38) He never saw the bills and believes \nhe does not owe the money. (Tr. 17) Applicant had health insurance from his employer. \n(Tr. 17) However, Applicant\u2019s young sons, ages one and four, have had medical \n\n \n4 \ntreatment. He will continue to investigate these two medical accounts in an attempt to \nlocate the creditor. (Tr. 73)  \n \nIn May 2004, Applicant was his high school class valedictorian. (Tr. 33) He \nreceived an academic scholarship for college. (Tr. 34) In May 2008, he graduated cum \nlaude with a Bachelor of Science degree in industrial technology. (Ex. C) Beginning in \nthe spring of 2009, he returned to university and received his Master\u2019s degree in May \n2010. (Ex. D, E)  \n \nApplicant asserts he has learned from his mistakes and is moving forward. (Tr. \n27) From the incidents, he learned he has to control his anger and that one should \navoid bad situations when possible. (Tr. 35) He has since matured. He takes \nresponsibility for his actions. (Tr. 44) Applicant now lives a straightforward life and sees \nno possibility of criminal conduct recurring. (Tr. 55) He is remorseful about his conduct.  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which must be considered in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \n\n \n5 \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination of the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nCriminal Conduct \n \nUnder the Criminal Conduct Guideline, the security eligibility of an applicant is \nplaced into question when an applicant is shown to have a history or pattern of criminal \nactivity which creates doubt about his judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. By its \nvery nature, it calls into question a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, \nrules and regulations. \n \nAG \u00b6 31 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying: \n \n(a) a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses; and \n \n(c) allegation or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the \nperson was formally charged, formally prosecuted or convicted. \n \n \nApplicant was guilty of battery and DWI. An additional felony charge of terroristic \nthreatening was nolle prosequi when he pleaded guilty to the battery charge. These \nevents involve serious criminal conduct. The disqualifying conditions listed in AG \u00b6 \n31(a) and (c) apply.  \n \nAG \u00b6 32 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns: \n \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment; and \n \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited \nto the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or \n\n \n6 \nrestitution, job training or higher education, good employment record, or \nconstructive community involvement; and, \n \n \nThe conduct was serious. However, it has been more than seven years since the \nbattery and six years since the threats. The DWI occurred more recently, having \noccurred three years ago, but there is no indication that alcohol use is a continuing \nproblem. As a 17-year-old, he should have avoided the fight at the convenience store. \nHe should not have called his girlfriend and left threats on her answering machine. \nThese are acts of immaturity.  \n \n \nThis conduct did occur under circumstances that are not likely to repeat \nthemselves. Additionally, the battery occurred when Applicant was in high school and \nthe threat occurred two months after graduating from high school. Actions of a high \nschool student or those of a recent high school graduate are not likely to be the same \nas the conduct of an individual seven years older. He is now 25, is more mature, and is \nunlikely to become involved in such conduct in the future. Applicant is no longer that 18 \nyear old he was when he called his girlfriend in 2004. He and his girlfriend currently live \ntogether, have two children, and are not experiencing problems. \n \n \nHis DWI did not occur under unusual circumstances. He had been drinking with \nfriends when stopped for failing to have his lights on. His BAC was .08 percent. This \nconduct is more recent, having occurred three years ago, but alcohol-related \nmisconduct is infrequent in Applicant\u2019s life. The mitigating conditions in AG \u00b6 32 (a) \npartially apply. \n \n \nThere is evidence of successful rehabilitation. This includes the passage of time \nwithout recurrence of criminal activity. The last criminal activity occurred more than \nthree years ago. Applicant has expressed remorse about his conduct. He has paid the \ncourt-ordered restitution. He has learned from his mistakes, learned to control his anger, \nand is moving forward. He is more mature and takes responsibility for his actions. It is \nunlikely the criminal conduct would recur. Applicant has acknowledged his guilt, \nacknowledged his behavior was inappropriate, and taken positive steps to eliminate the \ninappropriate behavior from recurring. \n \n \nSince the battery, Applicant was his high school class valedictorian. In May 2008, \nhe received a Bachelor of Science degree in industrial technology, graduating cum \nlaude. In May 2010, he obtained his master\u2019s degree. He obtained his current job just \nafter finishing his undergraduate degree. Applicant\u2019s supervisors describe Applicant\u2019s \nduty performance in glowing terms. His duty performance is outstanding. The mitigating \nconditions in AG \u00b6 32 (d) apply. \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \n \nAdjudicative Guideline (AG) \u00b6 18 articulates the security concerns relating to \nfinancial problems: \n \n\n \n7 \nFailure or inability to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds. \n \nAn individual who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, negligent, or careless in properly handling and safeguarding classified \ninformation. Behaving responsibly or irresponsibly in one aspect of life provides an \nindication of how a person may behave in other aspects of life.  \n \nA person\u2019s relationship with his creditors is a private matter until evidence is \nuncovered demonstrating an inability or unwillingness to repay debts as agreed. Absent \nsubstantial evidence of extenuating or mitigating circumstances, an applicant with a \nhistory of serious or recurring financial difficulties is in a position of risk that is \ninconsistent with holding a security clearance. An applicant is not required to be debt \nfree, but is required to manage his finances to meet his financial obligations. \n \n \nApplicant had an $11,854 restitution debt, which he satisfied in August 2009. His \nCBR lists two additional unpaid accounts that together total approximately $700. \nDisqualifying Conditions AG \u00b6 19(a), \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts\u201d and AG \n\u00b6 19(c), \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations,\u201d apply.  \n \n \nThe following mitigating conditions AG \u00b6 20 are potentially applicable: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control; and \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts. \n \nThe court-ordered restitution related to the fight has been paid. The fight \noccurred six years ago, when Applicant was 17 years old. Applicant is remorseful about \nhis conduct, is more mature, and has learned to control his anger. It is unlikely he will \nagain incur financial problems resulting from a fight. The mitigating conditions listed in \nAG \u00b6 20(a) apply. \n \n\n \n8 \nApplicant paid the restitution and does not recognize the other two bills. These \ntwo bills are the only adverse, derogatory financial information listed in his CBR. He \ndoes not appear to have financial problems. He is living within his means and paying his \ndebts as agreed. The mitigating conditions listed in AG \u00b6 20(c) apply. \n \nOf the three debts, Applicant has paid the largest. He knows the remaining two \ndebts were not for his medical care, but is investigating the debts, which may be for his \nsons\u2019 care. His employer\u2019s medical insurance should have paid any medical bills. Based \non an assessment of Applicant, on his educational achievements, and work \nperformance, I find it is likely he will pay the two medical bills, if they are his debts. The \nmitigating conditions listed in AG \u00b6 20(d) apply. \n \nEven without proof of payment, these two debts total less than $700 and are \nsufficiently small so as not to raise security concerns about his current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. The first two criminal acts were \nthose of a high school student or occurred the summer after high school graduation. \nThe DWI is more recent having occurred three years ago. Applicant performed well in \nhigh school, undergraduate school, and in graduate school. His work performance has \nalso been outstanding. I believe Applicant when he expressed remorse for his actions \nand stated such behavior would not recur.  \n \nThe two remaining unpaid debts were not the type that indicate poor self-control, \nlack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations. Money was not \n\n \n9 \nspent frivolously. The remaining debts were not incurred on luxuries, but are listed as \nmedical treatment. Of course, the issue is not simply whether all his debts are paid\u2014it is \nwhether his financial circumstances raise concerns about his fitness to hold a security \nclearance. (See AG & 2(a)(1).) These two remaining debts, which total $700, do not \nraise a security concern. There is no other adverse financial information about \nApplicant.  \n \nApplicant presented sufficient evidence to explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nsecurity concerns raised. Applicant met his ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a \nfavorable clearance decision. Overall, the record evidence leaves me without questions \nor doubts about Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all \nthese reasons, I conclude Applicant mitigated the security concerns arising from his \ncriminal conduct and financial considerations.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Criminal Conduct:  \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a\u20141.c:  \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \nParagraph 2, Financial Considerations:  FOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a\u20142.c:  \nFor Applicant \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.  \n \n \n \n_______________________ \nCLAUDE R. HEINY II \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Goldstein, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nTUIDER, Robert J., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant has mitigated security concerns pertaining to Guideline G (alcohol \nconsumption). Clearance is granted. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn August 23, 2007, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for \nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP). On August 27, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings \nand Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing \nsecurity concerns under Guideline G (alcohol consumption). The action was taken \nunder Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \n(February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) effective within the \nDepartment of Defense for SORs on September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on September 18, 2009, and DOHA received his \nanswer on September 21, 2009. Department Counsel was prepared to proceed on \nJuly 30, 2010\n\n \n2 \n \n \nOctober 27, 2009. The case was assigned to me on November 5, 2009. DOHA issued a \nnotice of hearing on January 12, 2010, scheduling the hearing for January 27, 2010. \nThe hearing was held as scheduled. \n \nThe Government offered Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 3, which were \nreceived without objection. Applicant offered Applicant Exhibits (AE) A and B, which \nwere received without objection, and he testified on his behalf.  \n \nI held the record open until February 12, 2010, to afford Applicant the opportunity \nto submit additional documents. Applicant timely submitted AE C, which was received \nwithout objection. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on February 3, 2010. The \nrecord closed on February 12, 2010.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant admitted all of the SOR allegations except for SOR \u00b6 1.c., which he \ndenied. His admissions are incorporated as findings of fact. After a thorough review of \nthe evidence, I make the following additional findings of fact. \n \nApplicant is a 26-year-old database analyst, who has been employed by a \ndefense contractor since August 2007. (GE 1, Tr. 12-13) He seeks to retain his security \nclearance, which he has held since August 2007. Maintaining a security clearance is \nessential for Applicant to remain in his current position. (Tr. 15-16.) \n \nApplicant graduated from high school in May 2002. He attended university from \nAugust 2002 to May 2007, and was awarded a Bachelor of Science Degree in \nManagement Information Systems. He has never married and has no dependents. (GE \n1, Tr. 13-15.) \n \nApplicant has a history of episodic alcohol abuse, marked by excessive alcohol \nconsumption, a December 2005 driving under the influence (DUI) arrest, driving a \nvehicle while impaired, and three blackouts. He began drinking while he was in high \nschool, and his drinking increased while in college. He does not dispute the fact that \nduring this timeframe he drank excessively and to the point of intoxication. (SOR \u00b6 1.a., \nTr. 16-17.)   \n  \nIn December 2005, Applicant was arrested and charged with DUI, speeding, and \nDUI with a BAC of .08 or more. At the time of his arrest, he was 21 years old and still in \ncollege. He was driving home from a bowling ally after a late night outing when he was \nstopped for speeding. The charges were later dismissed. (SOR \u00b6 1.b., Tr. 17-23.) \nApplicant significantly reduced his alcohol consumption after his DUI arrest, however, \nhe later increased his alcohol consumption for a short time. He stated, \u201cI know that I \ndrank heavily in college after my first girlfriend broke up with me. I\u2019m not sure if it was \ndirectly related (to it) or if it was just being irresponsible with college dorm mates.\u201d (Tr. \n23-24, 26-28.) \n\n \n3 \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.c. alleged that between 2000 and December 2005, Applicant drove a \nmotor vehicle approximately five to fifteen times while intoxicated. He denied this \nallegation in his Response to SOR. He takes exception to the number of times he \npurportedly drove a motor vehicle while intoxicated. He does, however, concede there \nwere a \u201cnumber of times\u201d that he chose to get behind a motor vehicle while intoxicated \n(Tr. 25.) Applicant had about three alcohol-related blackouts between 2002 and 2008. \n(SOR \u00b6 1.d.) He denied having any blackouts since then. (Tr. 32.) \n \nApplicant applied for access to Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI) with \nanother Government agency (AGA) in 2008, and his alcohol history was identified as a \nsecurity concern. The AGA referred Applicant to a clinical psychologist who prepared a \npsychological consultation report in May 2008. The AGA denied him SCI access noting \nthat \u201c[w]hile [Applicant] was not diagnosed with Alcohol Abuse or Dependence, he is \ndeemed a high risk to engage in behaviors indicative of poor judgment, impulsivity, or \nirresponsibility in the future. This coupled with his seemingly high consumption habits, \nrecent blackouts, and history of driving under the influence of alcohol renders \n[Applicant] ineligible for access to [AGA] SCI.\u201d (GE 3.) \n \nApplicant has significantly reduced his alcohol consumption. The last time he \nbecame intoxicated was on New Year\u2019s Eve with his friends. (Tr. 33-34.) He stated, \u201cI \nthink it (past alcohol consumption) helped me realize that it was about time to grow up. I \nthink it was just being a little bit juvenile in my alcohol consumption.\u201d (Tr. 35.) Applicant \ndescribed his current alcohol consumption as \u201c[s]ometimes I don\u2019t drink at all for the \nweek, sometimes I\u2019ll have a glass of wine with dinner, sometimes I won\u2019t.\u201d (Tr. 37.) \nApplicant acknowledged that he had a problem with alcohol in the past, but stated he \ndrinks responsibly now. (Tr. 39.) \n \nPsychological and Substance Abuse Evaluation \n \nPost-hearing, Applicant submitted a Psychological and Substance Abuse \nEvaluation prepared in February 2010. (AE C.) Briefly, the neuropsychologist\u2019s \ncredentials consist of over 30 years of experience in alcohol and other drug abuse \nassessment, treatment, and research. He has designed and managed chemical \ndependency treatment programs, and has been a consultant to private, state, county, \nfederal, and national chemical dependency treatment programs. He is a Ph.D. trained \nneuropsychologist, a Board Certified Forensic Examiner, a Fellow of the American \nCollege of Forensic Examiners International, and holds the APA Certificate of \nProficiency in Alcohol and Other Substance Abuse Treatment. (FRE 702.) \n \nUnder Diagnostic Considerations, the neuropsychologist stated that Applicant\u2019s \nMMPI-2 profile listed no diagnostic possibilities adding that all available sources of \ninformation should be considered before establishing final diagnoses. Under Axis I \nDiagnostic Considerations, he listed 305.00 Alcohol Abuse, and under Axis II, he listed \n799.0 Diagnosis Deferred on Axis II, alternatively stated, incomplete data precludes \ndiagnostic judgment. The neuropsychologist listed under conditions and experiences \nthat may compromise Applicant\u2019s employment success: (1) he started his substance \n\n \n4 \n \n \nabuse in his teenage years, (2) he used alcohol to cope with problems, (3) he was \narrested for DUI, and (4) he has a high tolerance for alcohol.  \n \nListed under characteristics and conditions that will improve his chances for \nsuccess: (1) he has had periods of abstinence, (2) he has significantly reduced his \ndrinking frequency and amount, (3) he has a supportive family, (4) he have moved out \nof a peer situation with alcohol abuse norms, (5) there is no family history of substance \nabuse or dependence, (6) there is no family history of mental illness, (7) he has \nreasonably good social skills, (8) he has a track record of demonstrated success in \nbusiness and academia, (9) he has alternatives for positive addictions, (10) he does not \nhave personality disorders that would increase his risk for failure, and (11) he \nexperiences anxiety, guilt, and remorse that can motivate positive lifestyle changes. \n \nCharacter Evidence \n \n \nApplicant submitted a reference letter from his company vice president. He \nstated that Applicant \u201cconsistently met or exceeded all job requirements as needed by \nboth management and his team.\u201d He further stated that Applicant \u201cis an individual of \nhigh character, who may have just made some juvenile mistakes\u201d and recommended \nhim for a security clearance. (AE A.) \n \n \nApplicant also submitted a statement from his girlfriend, who is an attorney. She \nstated, \u201c[i]n these past four years I have seen [Applicant} mature immensely. On \nweekends, we spend our nights trying out new recipes rather than frequenting college \nbars. She concluded by saying that Applicant \u201chas drastically reduced his alcohol \nconsumption. He has replaced old vices with new hobbies and matured significantly. I \nam confident in my positive review of [Applicant\u2019s] character, and affirm that he is a \nnothing short of a responsible individual.\u201d (AE B.) \n \nPersonal Observations \n \nHaving observed Applicant\u2019s demeanor closely, I find his testimony credible. At \nhis hearing, Applicant promptly answered all the questions asked. He was frank, candid, \nand forthcoming in his answers and explained his answers without hesitation. He readily \nacknowledged his bad behavior.  \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised AG. In addition to brief introductory \nexplanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying \nconditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an Applicant\u2019s \neligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \n\n \n5 \n \n \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption \n \n  \nUnder Guideline G (alcohol consumption), the Government\u2019s concern is that \nexcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment or \nthe failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability \nand trustworthiness. (AG \u00b6 21.) \n \nThe Government established its case under Guideline G through Applicant\u2019s \nadmissions and the evidence presented. Applicant consumed alcohol excessively and \nat times and to the point of intoxication from 2000 to 2009, was arrested for DUI in \n\n \n6 \n \n \nDecember 2005, drove a motor vehicle various times while intoxicated from 2000 to \n2005, and experienced at least three alcohol-related blackouts between 2002 and 2008. \n \n \nA review of the evidence supports application of two alcohol consumption \ndisqualifying conditions. AG \u00b6 22(a): \u201calcohol-related incidents away from work, such as \ndriving while under the influence,\u201d and AG \u00b6 22(c): \u201chabitual or binge consumption of \nalcohol to the point of impaired judgment, regardless of whether the individual is \ndiagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent,\u201d apply.  \nConsidering the totality of the circumstances in this case, I find that application of \none alcohol consumption mitigating condition is appropriate. AG \u00b6 23(b) \u201cthe individual \nacknowledges his or her alcoholism or issues of alcohol abuse, provides evidence of \nactions taken to overcome this problem, and has established a pattern of abstinence (if \nalcohol dependent) or responsible use (if an alcohol abuser).\u201d Although Applicant has \nnever been diagnosed as alcohol dependent or as an alcohol abuser, he has \nacknowledged and recognizes the deleterious effect the misuse of alcohol has had on \nhis life. Two qualified medical professionals have evaluated Applicant and neither \nconcluded that he was an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent. The first evaluation was \nconducted in May 2008 by a psychologist on behalf of AGA, and the second evaluation \nwas conducted in February 2010 by a neuropsychologist selected by Applicant. Neither \nmedical professional diagnosed Applicant with an underlying alcohol dependence or \nalcohol abuse problem. \nApplicant presented credible evidence of actions taken to overcome his problem, \nand established he has significantly modified his behavior and alcohol consumption \nover the last two years. He is remorseful for his behavior and has initiated changes in \nhis lifestyle. The statement from a senior company representative shows Applicant\u2019s \nwork behavior has not been indicative of an alcohol problem. He is viewed as a valuable \nemployee, who is reliable, dependable, and professional. Applicant\u2019s sobriety and \nresponsible use of alcohol is supported not only by his company vice president, but also \nby his attorney-girlfriend of four years. Furthermore, Applicant acknowledged the \nproblems his misuse of alcohol has caused him, demonstrated remorse, and a steadfast \ncommitment to continue lifestyle changes consistent with the responsible use of alcohol.  \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and \n\n \n7 \n \n \nother permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person-concept.  \n \nApplicant has been forthright and cooperative throughout this entire process. He \nvoluntarily underwent a post-hearing psychological and substance abuse evaluation \nfrom a qualified neuropsychologist. At age 26, he recognizes the adverse \nconsequences of misusing alcohol. Apparently, these consequences were not part of \nhis thought process during his high school and college years. Applicant has been willing \nto do whatever is necessary to demonstrate his responsible alcohol consumption. He \nhas family support, stable employment, and a strong work ethic. His willingness to make \nsignificant lifestyle changes accompanied by company, family and girlfriend support \nshould ensure his continued success. Applicant demonstrated the correct attitude and \ncommitment to being sober. Considering his demeanor and testimony, I believe \nApplicant has learned from his mistakes, and his questionable behavior is unlikely to \nrecur. In sum, I find Applicant has presented sufficient evidence of rehabilitation.  \n \nAlso noteworthy is Applicant\u2019s past behavior, which serves as a reliable indicator \nof future behavior. In particular, he has successfully held a security clearance since \nAugust 2007. He does not drink and drive, he has disassociated himself with his \u201cfrat \nhouse\u201d college and post-college lifestyle. He has been cooperative throughout this \nprocess and recognizes the gravity of these proceedings. Applicant is living a different \nlifestyle from the person who was arrested for DUI in December 2005. He is in a stable \nrelationship, is a responsible and contributing citizen, and is a trusted and valued  \nemployee.  \n \nTo conclude, Applicant presented sufficient evidence to explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate the security concerns raised. Applicant met his ultimate burden of persuasion to \nobtain a favorable clearance decision. I take this position based on the law, as set forth \nin Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988), my careful consideration of the \nwhole-person factors and supporting evidence, my application of the pertinent factors \nunder the adjudicative process, and my interpretation of my responsibilities under the \nadjudicative guidelines. For the reasons stated, I conclude he is eligible for access to \nclassified information. \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline G:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a. \u2013 d.:  \nFor Applicant \n \n \n\n \n8 \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n \n_________________ \nROBERT J. TUIDER \nAdministrative Judge \n",

The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative\nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective\nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR, answered the allegations, and\nrequested a hearing before an administrative judge. I received the case assignment on\nJuly 2, 2009. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on July 27, 2009, and I convened the\nhearing as scheduled on August 26, 2009. The Government offered Exhibits (GE 1-3),\nSeptember 25, 2009\n\n2\nwhich were received without objection. Applicant testified on his own behalf and\npresented Exhibit (AE A) which was admitted into the record without objection. DOHA\nreceived the transcript on September 3, 2009. Based upon a review of the record,\npleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified information is\ndenied.\nFindings of Fact\nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the factual allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a\nthrough 1.f of the SOR.  \nApplicant is a 36-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He graduated from\nhigh school in 1991, and has attended many college courses. He is single (Tr. 26).\nApplicant worked in the music industry from approximately 1998 until 2006. He has\nbeen with his current employer in a full-time capacity since August 8, 2006 (GE 1).\nFrom 1991 until 1993, Applicant illegally used LSD while at home or in a friend\u2019s\nhome (Tr. 48). He was arrested in July 1993, and charged with Possession of\nControlled Substance (LSD), a felony (GE 3). Applicant was placed on a six-year\nprobation but was released after three years. He attended a drug education class. He\nresumed using illegal drugs after the probation was completed. \nApplicant illegally used marijuana, cocaine and ecstasy (MDMA) from\napproximately 2001 until July 2008. He used the illegal drugs while working in his music\nstudio and in his home. He used marijuana approximately 2000 times (Tr. 30). Applicant\nadmitted that he was a daily user of marijuana. His cocaine use from 2001 until July\n2008 occurred in the privacy of his home with his girlfriend (Tr. 31). He estimates that\nhe used it approximately 100 times (Tr. 30). During this period Applicant also used\necstasy with his girlfriend in the privacy of his home. He gave different estimates of the\nfrequency of the use (Tr. 26).\nApplicant usually purchased the illegal drugs from his friends. He stated that he\nnever sold any drugs. At the hearing, Applicant explained that he did not believe he was\nhurting anyone by using illegal drugs in the privacy of his home (Tr. 22). He does not\nbelieve that he needs drug counseling. He is still friends with the people with whom he\nused drugs (Tr. 28). \nAfter Applicant completed his July 1, 2008, security clearance application (SF\n86), he decided to use illegal drugs again as a last \u201churrah\u201d. He admits using\n(psilocybin) \u201cmushrooms\u201d twice. Applicant used illegal drugs while he was working for\nhis current employer. He did not inform his employer about his drug use until his\nsecurity clearance investigation in 2008.\nApplicant stopped using illegal drugs because of concerns with his current job.\nHe does not want to lose his current position. He believes he excels in the position. He\n\n3\nwants to move forward with his life. He recognizes that a security clearance is needed\nfor this job so that he can advance financially (Tr. 53).\nApplicant has many letters of recommendation from his friends and former\ncolleagues. Each one attests to his diligence, character and trustworthiness. He is\nconsiderate of others, kind, and honest (AE A). Applicant\u2019s supervisor recommends him\nfor a security clearance. Applicant is an indispensable member of the team.\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c),\nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the\n\u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable\ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a\ndecision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\n\n4\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).\nAnalysis\nGuideline H, Drug Involvement\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for drug involvement is set out in\nAG & 24:      \nUse of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because it may\nimpair judgment and because it raises questions about a person\u2019s ability\nor willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nAG & 25(a), Aany drug abuse@ is potentially disqualifying. Under AG \u00b6 25(c) \u201cillegal drug\npossession, including cultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or\ndistribution; or possession of drug paraphernalia\u201d is also potentially disqualifying.\nApplicant admitted his use of marijuana, cocaine, ecstasy, and mushrooms in varying\namounts and frequency spanning a period from about 2001 to 2008. In 1993, he was\ncharged with possession of a controlled substance. These disqualifying conditions apply\nin this case.\nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security\nconcerns arising from drug involvement. Under AG \u00b6 26(a), the disqualifying condition\nmay be mitigated where Athe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or\noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt\non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ Applicant=s\npattern of illegal drug use continued from a young age to adult maturity. He was a\nmature adult working for a company and violating the drug policy when he continued to\nuse illegal drugs. He used illegal drugs until July 2008. This shows poor judgment and\nlack of trustworthiness, given the fact that he had applied for a security clearance during\nthat time. I do not find that this mitigating condition applies.  \nUnder AG \u00b6 26(b), it may be mitigating where there is Aa demonstrated intent not\nto abuse any drugs in the future, such as: (1) disassociation from drug-using associates\nand contacts; (2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; (3) an\nappropriate period of abstinence; and (4) a signed statement of intent with automatic\nrevocation of clearance for any violation.\u201d This is not a factor for consideration in this\ncase for the reasons discussed above.\n\n5\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the\nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case and conclude that they are not\nsufficient to overcome the government\u2019s case. Applicant is a mature, well-educated\nprofessional. His use of illegal drugs for many years and his casual attitude about the\nuse of drugs is cause for concern. He stopped using illegal drugs during a period of\nprobation but resumed the illegal use after the probation ended. He believes that the\nuse of illegal drugs in the privacy of his home is not an indicator of his trustworthiness or\ncharacter.\nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility, judgment, and suitability for a security clearance. For all the\nreasons discussed above, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns\narising from his drug involvement. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline H:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nAgainst Applicant\n\n6\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.

    "summary": "findings of fact are rather minimal. In a nutshell, the Judge found that Applicant purchased two pieces of real property, financing the purchases with first and second mortgages on each. He found that Applicant no longer owed anything on these mortgages. He found that the real estate market entered a downturn and the properties went into foreclosure. The Judge favorably applied two Mitigating Conditions (FCMC): 20(a) and (b). The Judge 1 2 relied in large measure upon his view that Applicant no longer owed the debts alleged in the SOR and that the financial problems in this case were caused by circumstances outside Applicant\u2019s control. Department Counsel\u2019s argument that the record will not support these conclusions is persuasive to me. Concerning 20(a), there is a paucity of record evidence to support the conclusion that Applicant no longer owed three of the four alleged debts and, therefore, that they are not recent. The corroborating evidence supplied by Applicant is speculative at best and is contradicted by the contents of a credit report dated one day prior to the hearing, an exhibit offered by Applicant himself. I do not believe that the evidence viewed as a whole supports a judgement that Applicant has demonstrated that he no longer owes the debts. Rather, the evidence most reasonably demonstrates that the debts are ongoing. In Government Exhibit (GE) 1, Security Clearance Application, dated September 2, 2008, Applicant states that 3 he is not married and had never bee",

Applicant\nrequested a hearing.  On December 15, 2009, after the hearing, Administrative Judge Richard A.\nCefola granted Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Department Counsel appealed pursuant\nto Directive \u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nDepartment Counsel raised the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge failed to\nconsider the entire record evidence; whether the Judge\u2019s application of the pertinent mitigating\nconditions was erroneous; and whether the Judge\u2019s whole-person analysis was erroneous.  Finding\nerror, we remand.\nAs a threshold issue the Board must determine if the Judge\u2019s decision is sufficiently clear as\nto allow the parties and the Board to discern with confidence the Judge\u2019s findings and conclusions.\nSee, e.g., ISCR Case No. 08-05379 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Nov. 24, 2009) and ISCR Case No. 02-05665\nat 4 (App. Bd. May 7, 2003).  In the case before us the Judge\u2019s decision does not meet that test.  The\nBoard has also held that the parties and the Board have a right to know what findings the Judge is\nmaking with respect to all the SOR allegations, not just some of them.  See e.g., ISCR Case No. 08-\n07803 at 2 (App. Bd. Sep. 21, 2009) and ISCR Case No. 03-22883 at 3 (App. Bd. Jan 19, 2006).\nThe SOR alleges that Applicant has four delinquent debts which taken together total over\n$900,000 in value.  In two separate paragraphs the Judge notes that two SOR allegations relate to\na property, the property was foreclosed on, and Applicant owes nothing on these debts.  The Judge\u2019s\ndecision does not inform the reader of when the debts were incurred, how much they were for, when\nthe debtor became delinquent, what the debtor\u2019s income was, if the debtor had intended to pay the\ndebts and how he intended to do so, how much of the debts were paid before the foreclosure, how\nmuch of the debts were paid in the foreclosure proceedings, and other pertinent facts.  Without\ndelineating this type of information it is not reasonable to reach conclusions about Applicant\u2019s\njudgment in a case that is about delinquent debts.\nThe Judge\u2019s analysis is a little more revealing, although it largely relies on conclusory\nstatements that  Applicant\u2019s difficulties arose from the collapse of the real estate market, his wife\u2019s\njob loss, and the loss of a tenant.  Here too, the reader would benefit from additional detail and\nexplanation.\nIn light of the weaknesses described above, the Board is not in a position to review the\nalleged errors in the Judge\u2019s decision.\nOrder\nThe Judge\u2019s favorable security clearance decision is REMANDED for a new decision in\naccordance with the discussion above.   \n\nDirective \u00b6 E2.20(a): \u201cthe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such\n1\ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness,\nor good judgement[.]\u201d\nDirective \u00b6 E2.20(b): \u201cthe conditions that resulted in the financial problems were largely beyond the person\u2019s\n2\ncontrol (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce, or\nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances[.]\u201d  \n3\nSigned: Michael Y.

Billett\nAdministrative Judge\nMember, Appeal Board\nDissenting Opinion of Administrative Judge James E. Moody\nI respectfully disagree with my colleagues\u2019 resolution of this case.  In my judgement, the\nrecord will not support a favorable decision.\nMy colleagues are correct that the Judge\u2019s findings of fact are rather minimal.  In a nutshell,\nthe Judge found that Applicant purchased two pieces of real property, financing the purchases with\nfirst and second mortgages on each.  He found that Applicant no longer owed anything on these\nmortgages.  He found that the real estate market entered a downturn and the properties went into\nforeclosure.  \nThe Judge favorably applied two Mitigating Conditions (FCMC): 20(a)  and (b).   The Judge\n1\n2\nrelied in large measure upon his view that Applicant no longer owed the debts alleged in the SOR\nand that the financial problems in this case were caused by circumstances outside Applicant\u2019s\ncontrol.  Department Counsel\u2019s argument that the record will not support these conclusions is\npersuasive to me.   \nConcerning 20(a), there is a paucity of record evidence to support the conclusion that\nApplicant no longer owed three of the four alleged debts and, therefore, that they are not recent.  The\ncorroborating evidence supplied by Applicant is speculative at best and is contradicted by the\ncontents of a credit report dated one day prior to the hearing, an exhibit offered by Applicant himself.\nI do not believe that the evidence viewed as a whole supports a judgement that Applicant has\ndemonstrated that he no longer owes the debts.  Rather, the evidence most reasonably demonstrates\nthat the debts are ongoing.\n\nIn Government Exhibit (GE) 1, Security Clearance Application, dated September 2, 2008, Applicant states that\n3\nhe is not married and had never been married.  GE 2, Answers to Interrogatories, contains a summary of Applicant\u2019s\npersonal interview.  In this interview he described the circumstances of his foreclosures, principally that the monthly\npayments increased due to the adjustable rate nature of the loans.  He stated in this interview that his fianc\u00e9e was aware\nof his financial problems, demonstrating that he was not married at the time of the foreclosures.  In this interview he did\nnot attribute his financial problems to his fianc\u00e9e\u2019s employment situation.  To that extent, this interview is somewhat\ninconsistent with Applicant\u2019s presentation at the hearing.  See Tr. at 51: \u201c[W]e ran out of money and we couldn\u2019t pay\nany more and also my wife who is in the mortgage business lost her job as well . . .\u201d   \nAE A, Stipulation for Settlement, indicates that Applicant accepted $30,000 in settlement of a lawsuit based\n4\nupon fraudulent over-appraisal of one of the properties.  See Department Counsel Brief at 7: \u201cBy purchasing these two\nproperties, Applicant obligated himself to make annual mortgage payments of nearly $118,000 (before any escalation),\nan amount substantially in excess of his gross annual salary . . .\u201d  \n4\n    \nThe Judge also noted Applicant\u2019s testimony regarding the collapse of the real estate market\nand his wife\u2019s loss of employment, in support of the view that the circumstances of the debts were\nunusual.  This was evidence which the Judge was required to consider.  However, this reliance is\nvitiated by evidence that Applicant did not marry his wife until after the properties went into\nforeclosure, thereby undermining the effect her subsequent unemployment would have exerted upon\nhis real estate difficulties.   It is further vitiated by record evidence that Applicant entered into the\n3\npurchase of two properties at 100% financing, the combined amounts of the adjustable rate\nmortgages exceeding $1,000,000 and the annual payments for which were more than his annual\nsalary.  The amount of these combined debts would not have been significantly less even had the first\nproperty not been over-appraised, as Applicant contended.   Under the circumstances, Applicant\u2019s\n4\npurchase of these properties raises serious questions about his reliability and good judgement,\nquestions which the Judge does not address in his decision.  I do not believe that the totality of the\nrecord evidence supports a conclusion that Applicant has met his burden of persuasion under FCMC\n20(a).\nFor similar reasons, I believe that the evidence will not support a favorable conclusion under\nFCMC 20(b).  Applicant\u2019s problems may have been affected by a downturn in the market.  However,\nthe fact of entering into such transactions at all, given his income and the foreseeable eventuality that\nthe interest owed on the mortgages would rise, given their adjustable nature, undermines a\nconclusion that the circumstances of the financial problems were largely beyond Applicant\u2019s control.\nIn my opinion, the record does not support the Judge\u2019s conclusion that Applicant has met his\nburden of persuasion as to mitigation, either under the mitigating conditions or the whole-person\nfactors, in light of the standard set forth in Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528\n(1988).  I would reverse the decision. \nSigned: James E. Moody             \nJames E. Moody\n\n5\nAdministrative Judge\nMember, Appeal Board\n",

Department Counsel appealed pursuant\nto Directive \u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.  On April 2, 2010, we remanded case to the Judge for a new\ndecision.  On August 27, 2010, the Judge issued a Decision on Remand, in which he again granted\nApplicant a security clearance.  Department Counsel appealed, in accordance with the Directive.\n\nDepartment Counsel raised the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge failed to\naddress the issues raised in the prior Appeal Board remand order and whether the Judge\u2019s decision\nis arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  Consistent with the following discussion, we reverse the\ndecision of the Judge.\nFacts\nThe Judge made the following pertinent findings of fact: Applicant purchased Property 1 as\na residence in 2003 for $410,000.  He financed Property 1 with two mortgages.  There was later\nfound to have been fraud involved in the appraisal for the original lender.  In 2005 Applicant\npurchased Property 2 for $710,000 as a residence and financed it with two more mortgages.  He\nconverted Property 1 to a rental.

He is current with all his debts.\nDiscussion \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility, there is a strong\npresumption against the grant or maintenance of a security clearance.  See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913\nF. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991).  After the Government presents\nevidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut or mitigate those\nconcerns.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  In rendering a final decision, an \u201cagency must examine the\nrelevant data and articulate a satisfactory explanation for\u201d the decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational\nconnection between the facts found and the choice made.\u2019\u201d Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n of the United\nStates v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983)(quoting Burlington Truck Lines,\nInc. v. United States, 371 U.S. 156, 168 (1962)).  The standard applicable in security clearance\ndecisions \u201cis that a clearance may be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests of the\nnational security.\u2019\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). \nIn deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are erroneous, the Board will review\nthe Judge's decision to determine whether:  it does not examine relevant evidence; it fails to\narticulate a satisfactory explanation for its conclusions, including a rational connection between the\nfacts found and the choice made; it does not consider relevant factors; it reflects a clear error of\njudgment; it fails to consider an important aspect of the case; it offers an explanation for the decision\nthat runs contrary to the record evidence; or it is so implausible that it cannot be ascribed to a mere\ndifference of opinion.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Jun. 2, 2006).\nDepartment Counsel contends that the Judge did not comply with the Board\u2019s Remand Order.\nIn its prior decision, the Board concluded that the Judge\u2019s decision was not sufficiently clear so as\nto allow the parties and the Board to discern with confidence all of the Judge\u2019s findings and\n\n1Directive Enclosure 2\u00b620(a): \u201cthe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such\ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness,\nor good judgement[.]\u201d\n2Directive, Enclosure \u00b6 20(b): \u201cthe conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the\nperson\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce,\nor separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances[.]\u201d  \n3To the extent that the Judge relied on such analysis it is important to note that the purpose of the current\nadjudication is to determine security eligibility rather than to collect debts.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 07-16841 at 4 (App.\nBd. Dec. 19, 2008) and ISCR Case No. 07-16427 at 4 (App. Bd. Feb. 4, 2010).  \n4Applicant Exhibit (AE) C is a Form 1099-A, Acquisition or Abandonment of Secured Property.  This form\nstates that, regarding one of the four mortgage debts, Applicant was not liable for repayment.  This document is\nconsistent with AE J, Credit Report, which makes no reference to the creditor for this particular loan.  There is no\ncomparable Form 1099  pertaining to the remaining three mortgage debts.  The three remaining mortgages do appear\non the credit report which shows past due amounts of $44,197, $10,101, and $86,000.    \nconclusions.  The Board mentioned various aspects of the case where additional detail and\nexplanation from the Judge were necessary to allow it to review the errors alleged.  Department\nCounsel now sets forth numerous instances in which the Judge allegedly did not comply with the\nBoard\u2019s instructions.  Without providing a detailed discussion of the various points raised by\nDepartment Counsel, the Board concludes that the Judge\u2019s remand decision is sufficiently detailed\nto enable the Board to address the issues raised on appeal. \nRegarding Department Counsel\u2019s assertion that the Judge\u2019s decision is arbitrary, capricious,\nor contrary to law, we have considered the Judge\u2019s decision in light of the record as a whole.  The\nJudge favorably applied two Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions (FCMC) : Directive,\nEnclosure 2 \u00b620(a)1 and \u00b620(b).2  The Judge relied in large measure upon his finding that Applicant\nno longer owed the debts alleged in the SOR and that the financial problems in this case were caused\nby circumstances outside Applicant\u2019s control.    \nConcerning 20(a), the record evidence does not support the conclusion that Applicant no\nlonger owed three of the four alleged debts and, therefore, that they are not recent.  We note the\nargument in Applicant\u2019s reply brief to the effect that state law protects Applicant from liability on\ndeficiency judgments.3  On the other hand, the corroborating evidence supplied by Applicant is\nspeculative and appears to be contradicted by the contents of a credit report dated one day prior to\nthe hearing, an exhibit offered by Applicant himself.  In light of this exhibit and the other record\nevidence, the Judge\u2019s conclusion that Applicant no longer owed anything arising from the\nforeclosure sale of his two houses is not sustainable.4      \n    \nThe Judge also noted Applicant\u2019s testimony regarding the collapse of the real estate market\nand his wife\u2019s loss of employment, in support of the view that the circumstances of the debts were\nunusual.  This was evidence which the Judge was required to consider, along with all the other\nrecord evidence.  However, the Judge\u2019s reliance upon this circumstance is vitiated by evidence that\nApplicant did not marry his wife until after the properties went into foreclosure, thereby\nundermining the effect her subsequent unemployment would have exerted upon his real estate\n\n5In Government Exhibit (GE) 1, Security Clearance Application, dated September 2, 2008, Applicant states that\nhe is not married and had never been married.  GE 2, Answers to Interrogatories, contains a summary of Applicant\u2019s\npersonal interview.  In this interview he described the circumstances of the foreclosures of both properties.  He stated\nthat his fianc\u00e9 was aware of his financial problems, demonstrating that he was not married at the time of the foreclosures.\nIn this interview he did not attribute his financial problems to his fiance\u2019s employment situation.  Compare this interview\nwith Tr. at 51: \u201cQ: So when you ran out of money and your wife lost her job, what happened to property number two?\nA: It went into foreclosure.\u201d     \n6In  GE 2, Applicant stated that the combined payments for Property 1 were $4,000 per month.  The combined\npayments for Property 2 were also $4,000.  Applicant further advised that his gross monthly salary was around $7,000\nand his net salary was $4,212.  He stated that his financial problems began in June 2007, when his mortgage payment\non Property 1 increased to $7,000.  \n7AE A, Stipulation for Settlement, indicates that Applicant accepted $30,000 in settlement of a lawsuit based\nupon fraudulent over-appraisal of one of the properties.  \ndifficulties.5  It is further undermined by record evidence that Applicant entered into the purchase\nof two properties at 100% financing, the combined amounts of the adjustable rate mortgages\nexceeded $1,000,000, and the payments for these mortgages were more than his salary.6  There is\nno basis in the record to conclude that the amount of these combined debts would have been\nsignificantly less even had the first property not been over-appraised, as Applicant contended.7\nUnder the circumstances, Applicant\u2019s purchase of these properties raises serious questions about his\nreliability and good judgement, questions which the Judge does not address in his decision.  Even\nassuming that state law protects Applicant from deficiency judgments, the totality of the record\nevidence does not support a conclusion that Applicant has met his burden of persuasion under\nFCMC 20(a).\nFor similar reasons, the evidence will not support a favorable conclusion under FCMC 20(b).\nNo doubt Applicant\u2019s problems were aggravated by a downturn in the market.  However, the fact\nof entering into such transactions at all, given his financial circumstances and the foreseeable\neventuality that the mortgage payments would rise (given their adjustable nature), undermines a\nconclusion that the circumstances of the financial problems were largely beyond Applicant\u2019s control.\nThe record does not support the Judge\u2019s conclusion that Applicant has met his burden of\npersuasion as to mitigation, either under the mitigating conditions or the whole person factors, in\nlight of the standard set forth in Egan.  The Judge\u2019s Decision on Remand is not sustainable.  \nOrder\nThe Judge\u2019s favorable security clearance decision is REVERSED.\n\nSigned: Michael Y. Ra\u2019anan          \nMichael Y.

He financed Property 1 with two mortgages. There was later found to have been fraud involved in the appraisal for the original lender. In 2005 Applicant purchased Property 2 for $710,000 as a residence and financed it with two more mortgages. He converted Property 1 to a rental. Applicant made no down payment on either property. Applicant earns about $82,000 a year.

Discussion Once a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of a security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government presents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. In rendering a final decision, an \u201cagency must examine the relevant data and articulate a satisfactory explanation for\u201d the decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.\u2019\u201d Motor Vehicle Mfrs.

On June 22, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and\nAppeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns\nunder Guideline F for Applicant.  The action was taken under Executive Order 10865,\nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended;\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised\nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and\neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on June 25, 2009.  He answered the\nSOR in writing through counsel on July 8, 2009, and requested a hearing before an\nAdministrative Judge.  DOHA received the request soon thereafter, and I received the\ncase assignment on August 4, 2009.  I granted Applicant\u2019s request for a delay until\nSeptember 16, 2009, in order for his counsel to be available.  DOHA issued a notice of\n\n2\nhearing on August 5, 2009, and I convened the hearing as scheduled on September 16,\n2009.  The Government offered Exhibits (GXs) 1 through 8, which were received\nwithout objection.  Applicant testified on his own behalf, as did four other witnesses, and\nsubmitted Exhibits (AppXs) A through BB, without objection.  DOHA received the\ntranscript of the hearing (TR) on September 23, 2009.  The record closed on September\n16, 2009, the date of the hearing.  Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings,\nexhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified information is granted.\nFindings of Fact\nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant through counsel denied the factual\nallegations in all of the subparagraphs of the SOR.\nGuideline F - Financial Considerations\nIn 2003, the Applicant purchased Property #1 as a residence; and in 2005 he\npurchased Property #2 for a new residence, thus turning Property #1 into a rental (TR at\npage 57 line 3 to page 59 line 16, and at page 59 line 17 to page 61 line 15).  The\noriginal appraisal price for Property #1 was fraudulently set high by the original lender,\nand the Applicant sued successfully in this regard (TR at page 48 line 16 to page 49 line\n4, and AppXs A and B).  This is evidenced by a Declaration by his former Counsel, who\nrepresented him in this matter, and by a Stipulation of Settlement from the lender\n(AppXs A and B).\nIn 2008, the real estate market collapsed, and the Applicant\u2019s spouse lost her job\n(TR at page 53 lines 3~11, and at page 61 line 16 to page 62 line 2).  In addition, the\nrenter of Property #1 moved out, and he was unable to rent the property (Id).  This\ncaused the Applicant financial difficulties.\n1.a. and 1.d.  It is alleged that the Applicant owes $344,000 and $86,000,\nrespectively on a first and a second mortgage on Property #1.  This property was\nforeclosed on by the lenders, and the Applicant now owes nothing on these debts (TR\nat page 47 lines 1~9 and 22~25, at page 52 lines 18~24, and AppXs A, C, D, J, Y and\nBB).  This is evidenced by a Declaration by his former Counsel, a Notice of Trustee\u2019s\nSale, a Home Loan 1099-A Tax Form, a Grant Deed, a Trustee\u2019s deed Upon Sale, and\na June 2009 Credit Report (AppXs A, C, D, J, Y and BB).\n1.b. and 1.c.  It is alleged that the Applicant owes $567,000 and $140,000,\nrespectively on a first and a second mortgage on Property #2.  This property was also\nforeclosed on by the lenders, and the Applicant, again, owes nothing on these debts\n(TR at page 47 lines 10~21, at page 52 line 25 to page 53 line 2, and AppXs J, Z, and\nAA).  This is evidenced by a Grant Deed, a Trustee\u2019s deed Upon Sale, and a June 2009\nCredit Report ( AppXs J, Z, and AA).\nThe Applicant is now current with all of his debts (see AppX J).  He has savings\nbonds with a current redemption in excess of $27,000 (AppX K); an investment portfolio\n\n3\nvalued at about $9,800 (AppX L); and about $2,255 and about $6,331 in two IRAs\n(AppXs N and O).\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG).  In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law.  Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process.  The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and commonsense decision.  According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d  The administrative judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration.  AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d  In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record.  Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR.  Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d  The\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence.  This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours.  The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information.  Decisions include, by necessity, consideration\nof the possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information.  Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\n\n4\napplicant concerned.\u201d  See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).\nAnalysis\nGuideline F - Financial Considerations\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set\nout in AG & 18:\nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information.  An individual who is financially\noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate\nfunds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns.  Under\nAG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.\nSimilarly under AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise\nsecurity concerns.  With the collapse of the real estate market, the Applicant became\ndelinquent as to first and second mortgages on two separate properties.  The evidence\nis thus sufficient to raise these potentially disqualifying conditions, requiring a closer\nexamination.\nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security\nconcerns arising from financial difficulties.  Under AG \u00b6 20(a), the disqualifying condition\nmay be mitigated where Athe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or\noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt\non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@  All of the\nApplicant\u2019s financial difficulties arose from the recent collapse of the real estate market,\nwhich was exacerbated by his spouse losing her job, and by the loss of a tenant.  I find\nthe behavior occurred under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur, and\nit does not raise concerns about his current reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment.  The evidence raises this potentially mitigating condition. \nUnder AG & 20(b), it may be mitigating where Athe conditions that resulted in the\nfinancial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a\nbusiness downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation),\nand the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.@  As noted above, the\nApplicant\u2019s spouse lost her job, and his tenant moved out of his rental property.  He now\nowes nothing on these debts.  I find this potentially mitigating condition is a factor for\nconsideration in this case. \n\n5\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances.  Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of\nwhether to grant eligibility for a security clearance must be an overall commonsense\njudgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines and the whole person\nconcept.\nThe Administrative Judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors\nlisted at AG \u00b6 2(a):\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nThe Applicant has offered the very supportive testimonies of a colleague, of his\nHuman Resources Manager, of the Vice President of his employer\u2019s operations, and of\nthe CEO and President of his employer\u2019s firm (TR at page 23 line 23 to page 45 line\n10).  He has also offered Personal Letters of Reference from three colleagues, from the\nFacility Security Officer, and from the before mentioned CEO (AppXs Q~U).  The CEO\navers, in part, the following:\n[The Applicant] . . . is a professional with an excellent reputation within the\nNavy C4I community as well as the Navy Information Assurance\ncommunity.  I have known [the Applicant] for over 3 years now and trust\nhis judgment, value his advice and know him to be of fine character.  I\nhave been aware of his security clearance issues since 2009 and that has\nnot changed my opinion of him nor altered our business relationship\n(AppX T).\nDuring his testimony, the CEO further averred that the Applicant was trustworthy;\nand as such, should be granted a security clearance (TR at page 42 line 10 to page 45\nline 10).\nI considered all of the evidence, including the potentially disqualifying and\nmitigating conditions surrounding this case.  Overall, the record evidence leaves me\nwithout questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security\nclearance.  For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant has mitigated the security\nconcerns arising from his financial considerations. \n\n6\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.\nRichard A. Cefola\nAdministrative Judge\n",

On June 22, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and\nAppeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns\nunder Guideline F for Applicant.  The action was taken under Executive Order 10865,\nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended;\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised\nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and\neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on June 25, 2009.  He answered the\nSOR in writing through counsel on July 8, 2009, and requested a hearing before an\nAdministrative Judge.  DOHA received the request soon thereafter, and I received the\ncase assignment on August 4, 2009.  I granted Applicant\u2019s request for a delay until\nSeptember 16, 2009, in order for his counsel to be available.  DOHA issued a notice of\nhearing on August 5, 2009, and I convened the hearing as scheduled on September 16,\n\n2\n2009.  The Government offered Exhibits (GXs) 1 through 8, which were received\nwithout objection.  Applicant testified on his own behalf, as did four other witnesses, and\nsubmitted Exhibits (AppXs) A through BB, without objection.  DOHA received the\ntranscript of the hearing (TR) on September 23, 2009.  The record closed on September\n16, 2009, the date of the hearing.  On December 15, 2009, I issued a Decision granting\nthe Applicant access to classified information.  The Government appealed this Decision.\nOn April 2, 2010, the Appeal Board issued a Decision, Remanding the \u201cfavorable\nsecurity decision\u201d to the undersigned with specific guidance.  That guidance will be\ndiscussed at length under the Findings of Fact and Analysis, below.  Based upon a\nreview of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to\nclassified information is again granted.\nFindings of Fact\nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant through counsel denied the factual\nallegations in all of the subparagraphs of the SOR.  Under the original Findings of\nFact, I found the following:\nGuideline F - Financial Considerations\nIn 2003, the Applicant purchased Property #1 as a residence; and in 2005 he\npurchased Property #2 for a new residence, thus turning Property #1 into a rental.  (TR\nat page 57 line 3 to page 59 line 16, and at page 59 line 17 to page 61 line 15.)  The\noriginal appraisal price for Property #1 was fraudulently set high by the original lender,\nand the Applicant sued successfully in this regard.  (TR at page 48 line 16 to page 49\nline 4, and AppXs A and B.)  This is evidenced by a Declaration by his former Counsel,\nwho represented him in this matter, and by a Stipulation of Settlement from the lender.\n(AppXs A and B.)\nIn 2008, the real estate market collapsed, and the Applicant\u2019s spouse lost her\njob.  (TR at page 53 lines 3~11, and at page 61 line 16 to page 62 line 2.)  In addition,\nthe renter of Property #1 moved out, and he was unable to rent the property.  (Id.)  This\ncaused the Applicant financial difficulties.\n1.a. and 1.d.  It is alleged that the Applicant owes $344,000 and $86,000,\nrespectively on a first and a second mortgage on Property #1.  This property was\nforeclosed on by the lenders, and the Applicant now owes nothing on these debts.  (TR\nat page 47 lines 1~9 and 22~25, at page 52 lines 18~24, and AppXs A, C, D, J, Y and\nBB.)  This is evidenced by a Declaration by his former Counsel, a Notice of Trustee\u2019s\nSale, a Home Loan 1099-A Tax Form, a Grant Deed, a Trustee\u2019s deed Upon Sale, and\na June 2009 Credit Report.  (AppXs A, C, D, J, Y and BB.)\n1.b. and 1.c.  It is alleged that the Applicant owes $567,000 and $140,000,\nrespectively on a first and a second mortgage on Property #2.  This property was also\nforeclosed on by the lenders, and the Applicant, again, owes nothing on these debts. \n\n3\n(TR at page 47 lines 10~21, at page 52 line 25 to page 53 line 2, and AppXs J, Z, and\nAA.)  This is evidenced by a Grant Deed, a Trustee\u2019s deed Upon Sale, and a June 2009\nCredit Report.  ( AppXs J, Z, and AA.)\nThe Applicant is now current with all of his debts.  (See AppX J.)  He has savings\nbonds with a current redemption in excess of $27,000 (AppX K); an investment portfolio\nvalued at about $9,800 (AppX L); and about $2,255 and about $6,331 in two IRAs\n(AppXs N and O).\nThe Appeal Board states the following, by way of guidance, as to my\nFindings of Fact:\nThe Judge\u2019s decision does not inform the reader of when the debts were\nincurred, how much they were for, when the debtor became delinquent,\nwhat the debtor\u2019s income was, if the debtor intended to pay the debts and\nhow he intended to do so, how much of the debts were paid before the\nforeclosure, how much of the debts were paid in the foreclosure\nproceedings, and other pertinent facts.  Without delineating this type of\ninformation it is not reasonable to reach conclusions about Applicant\u2019s\njudgment in a case about delinquent debts.\nAs noted above, the first mortgage debt on Property #1, which was turned into a\nrental property, was incurred in 2003.  (TR at page 57 line 3 to page 59 line 16, and at\npage 59 line 17 to page 61 line 15.)  The first mortgage debt on Property #2, which\nbecame the Applicant\u2019s new residence, was incurred in 2005.  (Id.)\nThe purchase price for Property #1 was $410,000, and for Property #2 was\n$710,000.  (TR at page 57 line 3 to page 59 line 16, and AppX A.)  Like many caught up\nin the real estate boom of that period, the Applicant was not required to make any down\npayment on either property.  (TR at page 59 line 17 to page 61 line 15.)  In 2008, the\nreal estate bubble burst, their monthly mortgage payments doubled, his, then fiancee,\nnow spouse lost her job and its income, and they lost Property #1's tenant.  (TR at page\n53 lines 3~11, and at page 60 line 22 to page 62 line 2.)  In summary, the following\ncolloquy occurred between the Applicant and Department Counsel:\nDepartment Counsel: When did you decide to let the bank foreclose on\nthese properties?\nApplicant: Pretty much when I talked to my lawyer, my real estate lawyer\nand when it came about when she, my wife lost her job and we had no\nmoney in our savings.\nDepartment Counsel: Did you attempt to sell either of these properties?\nApplicant: Oh yes, we tried.  We tried, but it would have cost us money.\n(TR at page 62 lines 3~15.)\n\n4\nThe value of Property #1 at the time of foreclosure was $270,000, as evidenced\nby a Home Loan 1099-A Tax Form from holder of the primary mortgage.  (AppX C.)\nThe value of Property #2  at the time of foreclosure was about $404,000, as evidenced\nby the Trustee\u2019s Deed Upon Sale.  (AppX AA.)  Neither the Government nor Applicant\u2019s\nCounsel established \u201chow much of the debts were paid before the foreclosure.\u201d\nIn 2008, the Applicant\u2019s, then fiancee, now wife was earning about $31,800.  (GX\n2 at page 10.)  That income has been lost.  The Applicant\u2019s current annual salary is\nabout \u201c$82,000 or $81,000.\u201d  (TR at page 53 lines 12~20.)  Since the foreclosures, he is\nnow current with his other financial obligations.  (Id., and AppXs H~J.)\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG).  In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law.  Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process.  The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and commonsense decision.  According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d  The administrative judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration.  AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d  In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record.  Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR.  Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d  The\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence.  This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours.  The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\n\n5\ngrants access to classified information.  Decisions include, by necessity, consideration\nof the possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information.  Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d  See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).\nAnalysis\nThe Appeal Board states the following, by way of guidance, as to my\nAnalysis:\nThe Judge\u2019s analysis is a little more revealing, although it largely relies on\nconclusory statements that Applicant\u2019s difficulties arose from the collapse\nof the real estate market, his wife\u2019s job loss, and loss of a tenant.  Here\ntoo, the reader would benefit from additional detail and explanation.\n(Emphasis supplied.)\nI have incorporated this guidance in my below analysis.\nGuideline F - Financial Considerations\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set\nout in AG & 18:\nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information.  An individual who is financially\noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate\nfunds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns.  Under\nAG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.\nSimilarly under AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise\nsecurity concerns.  In 2008, with the collapse of the real estate market, the Applicant\nbecame delinquent as to first and second mortgages on two separate properties.  The\nevidence is thus sufficient to raise these potentially disqualifying conditions, requiring a\ncloser examination.\n\n6\nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security\nconcerns arising from financial difficulties.  Under AG \u00b6 20(a), the disqualifying condition\nmay be mitigated where Athe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or\noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt\non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@  All of the\nApplicant\u2019s financial difficulties arose from the recent, 2008, collapse of the real estate\nmarket, which was exacerbated by his, then fiancee, now spouse losing her job, and by\nthe loss of a tenant.  The Applicant could not afford an attempt to sell the properties, as\nthat would cost additional monies that the Applicant did not have.  I find the behavior\noccurred under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur, and it does not\nraise concerns about his current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.  The\nevidence raises this potentially mitigating condition. \nUnder AG & 20(b), it may be mitigating where Athe conditions that resulted in the\nfinancial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a\nbusiness downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation),\nand the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.@  As noted above, the\nApplicant\u2019s spouse lost her job, and his tenant moved out of his rental property.  He now\nowes nothing on these debts.  I find this potentially mitigating condition is a factor for\nconsideration in this case. \nWhole-Person Concept\nUnder the whole-person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances.  Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of\nwhether to grant eligibility for a security clearance must be an overall commonsense\njudgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines and the whole person\nconcept.\nThe Administrative Judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors\nlisted at AG \u00b6 2(a):\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nThe Applicant has offered the very supportive testimonies of a colleague, of his\nHuman Resources Manager, of the Vice President of his employer\u2019s operations, and of\nthe CEO and President of his employer\u2019s firm.  (TR at page 23 line 23 to page 45 line\n10.)  He has also offered Personal Letters of Reference from three colleagues, from the\n\n7\nFacility Security Officer, and from the before mentioned CEO.  (AppXs Q~U.)  The CEO\navers, in part, the following:\n[The Applicant] . . . is a professional with an excellent reputation within the\nNavy C4I community as well as the Navy Information Assurance\ncommunity.  I have known [the Applicant] for over 3 years now and trust\nhis judgment, value his advice and know him to be of fine character.  I\nhave been aware of his security clearance issues since 2009 and that has\nnot changed my opinion of him nor altered our business relationship.\n(AppX T.)\nDuring his testimony, the CEO further averred that the Applicant was trustworthy;\nand as such, should be granted a security clearance.  (TR at page 42 line 10 to page 45\nline 10.)\nI considered all of the evidence, including the potentially disqualifying and\nmitigating conditions surrounding this case.  Overall, the record evidence leaves me\nwithout questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security\nclearance.  The 2008 collapse of the real estate market was an aberration which, with\nthe recent changes in the banking and lending laws, is unlikely to be repeated.  The\nApplicant has certainly learned a telling lesson as a result of the crash.  He is unlikely to\nget caught up in any future borrowing euphoria.  For all these reasons, I conclude\nApplicant has mitigated the security concerns arising from his financial considerations. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nFor Applicant\n\n8\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.\nRichard A. Cefola\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nFrancis J. Flanagan, Esq.\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On August 25, 2010, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of\nthe basis for that decision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline E (Personal Conduct),\n\nGuideline  G (Alcohol Consumption), Guideline H (Drug Involvement), and Guideline J (Criminal\nConduct)  of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).\nApplicant requested a hearing.  On May 19, 2011, after the hearing, Administrative Judge LeRoy\nF. Foreman denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant timely appealed pursuant\nto the Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raises the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s adverse security\nclearance decision is inconsistent with the Judge\u2019s findings, and whether the Judge\u2019s decision is\narbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  For the following reasons, the Board affirms the Judge\u2019s\nunfavorable decision. \nThe Judge made the following pertinent findings of fact: Applicant is 56 years old.  He has\nheld a security clearance since 1998.  Applicant began consuming alcohol in high school.  While in\nthe Navy, he consumed two to four beers every day after working hours, and after his discharge he\nsometimes consumed more than six beers at a sitting.  In the late 1990s he increased his beer\nconsumption because of his marital problems, occasionally consuming eight or nine beers in an\nevening.  He began purchasing and using marijuana in the 1970s, using it five or six times a year.\nHe stopped using marijuana during the late 1980s, but resumed use in the 1990s, when he purchased\nit four to six times a year and used it once or twice a month.  He stopped purchasing and using\nmarijuana and drinking alcohol after he was seriously injured in a motorcycle accident in 2009.\nApplicant was involved in alcohol-related driving incidents in 1977, 1995, 2004, 2007, and\nculminating in the 2009 accident where he was intoxicated and riding his motorcycle.  Additionally,\nin 2006, Applicant was charged with possession of marijuana and driving with a suspended or\nrevoked license.  In October 2009, Applicant was stopped for having an expired inspection sticker\nand arrested for driving on a suspended license.\nApplicant began court-ordered outpatient treatment in December 2009.  He was discharged\nfrom the program in February 2010.  The diagnostic summary comments favorably on his progress\nbut does not include a prognosis.  Applicant received counseling from a psychologist for about six\nweeks before the hearing.  \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application in May 2008.  When asked if he had\never been charged with or convicted of any offenses related to alcohol or drugs, he did not disclose\nhis DUI arrests in 1977 and 1995 or his arrest for possession of marijuana in 2006.  On the same\napplication he also did not disclose his marijuana use.  At the hearing, he admitted that he\nintentionally falsified his answer to this question because he was concerned that it would harm his\ncareer if he admitted his marijuana use.  In an interview with a security investigator in April 2010,\nAppellant admitted that he deliberately lied during prior interviews about his marijuana use and the\namount of his alcohol consumption.\nThe Judge reached the following conclusions: Applicant mitigated the security concerns\nunder the Alcohol Consumption and the Drug Involvement Guidelines.  Under the Personal Conduct\nGuideline, Applicant failed to mitigate numerous instances of deliberate falsification of his past\nalcohol, drug, and arrest history during official government inquiries.  Likewise, Applicant was\nunable to mitigate the government\u2019s security concerns under the Criminal Conduct Guideline\nrelating to his falsifications.  \n\nApplicant argues that the Judge\u2019s ultimate decision is inconsistent with his findings.  He\nstates that, although the Judge concluded that he had mitigated the security concerns based upon\nalcohol consumption and drug involvement, unfortunately the Judge found that he had not mitigated\nthe security concerns based upon personal conduct and criminal conduct.  Applicant asserts that his\nalcohol consumption and drug involvement was the source of his personal conduct and criminal\nconduct.  He argues that a finding of mitigation for alcohol consumption and drug involvement\nshould likewise mitigate further concerns about his behavior rising from said previous activities.\nApplicant also maintains that he is not vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or duress.  Applicant\u2019s\nassertions do not establish error on the part of the Judge.  \nApplicant stresses the mitigating evidence relating to his alcohol and drug use, and focuses\non the underlying conduct when arguing that the Judge\u2019s adverse decision concerning his numerous\nfalsifications should be reversed.  Applicant appears to argue that the security significance of the\nfalsifications derives from the security significance of the events that were the subject of the\nfalsifications.  This argument lacks merit.  An act of falsification has security significance\nindependent of any significance of the underlying conduct.   See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 01-19278 at\n7-8 (App. Bd. Apr. 22, 2003).  The mitigation of the underlying conduct has little bearing on the\nsecurity significance of the falsification, particularly in a case like this one, involving a pattern of\nmultiple falsifications.  Additionally, in the context of this case, Applicant\u2019s assertion that the record\nevidence establishes that he is not subject to coercion, exploitation, or duress does not establish\nerror.\nAfter reviewing the record, the Board concludes that the Judge examined the relevant data\nand articulated a satisfactory explanation for his decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between\nthe facts found and the choice made.\u2019\u201d Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n of the United States v. State Farm\nMut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983) (quoting Burlington Truck Lines, Inc. v.

He has held a security clearance since May 1998. \n \nApplicant\u2019s parents both had military service during World War II. His father \nserved in the Coast Guard and his mother served in the Navy. Applicant was on active \nduty in the Navy from September 1972 to September 1978. He served aboard Navy \nships in a combat zone, and he was honorably discharged. (Tr. 27-30.) \n \n \nIn June 2010, Applicant received an \u201cIndividual Achievement Award\u201d for his \n\u201congoing commitment to outstanding job performance\u201d and a $500 cash award. (AX A; \nAX B.) His performance appraisal for the year 2010 reflects that he \u201cmeets \nrequirements.\u201d The narrative description states that he \u201cdid a great job.\u201d (AX C.) \nApplicant\u2019s direct supervisor submitted a letter stating that he is trustworthy and very \ncareful with security issues. (AX E.) Applicant\u2019s supervisor is aware of his record of drug \nand alcohol abuse. (Tr. 43-44.) \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \n \nApplicant married in April 1985 and divorced in February 2004. No children were \nborn during the marriage. He and his ex-wife have an amicable relationship. They are \nboth in Alcoholics Anonymous (AA). (Tr. 33.) \n \n \nApplicant began consuming alcohol in high school. While in the Navy, he \nconsumed two to four beers every day after working hours. After he was discharged \nfrom the Navy, he continued his level of beer consumption, but he sometimes \nconsumed more than six beers at a sitting. In the late 1990s, he increased his beer \nconsumption because of his marital problems, occasionally consuming eight or nine \nbeers in an evening. He began purchasing and using marijuana in the 1970s, using it \nfive or six times a year. He stopped using marijuana during the late 1980s, but resumed \nuse in the 1990s, when he began purchasing it four to six times a year and using it once \nor twice a month. He stopped purchasing and using marijuana and drinking alcohol after \nhe was seriously injured in a motorcycle accident in April 2009. (GX 5.) \n  \n \nIn February 1977, Applicant was charged with misdemeanor drunk driving (DUI). \n(GX 4 at 3.) He admitted this offense in his answer to the SOR and at the hearing. (Tr. \n38.) The record does not reflect the disposition of this charge. \n \n \nIn December 1995, Applicant was charged with DUI and refusal to take a \nbreathalyzer test. The DUI charge was dismissed and he was fined for his refusal to \ntake a breathalyzer test. (GX 2 at 5; GX 5 at 2; GX 6 at 2.) At the hearing, Applicant \nadmitted that he was intoxicated on this occasion. (Tr. 39.) \n \n \nIn August 2004, Applicant was charged with weaving out of his lane of traffic, \npossessing an open container of alcohol in a motor vehicle, and refusing to take a \nbreathalyzer test. He was convicted of the breathalyzer refusal, fined, and ordered to \ncomplete community service and attend an alcohol-awareness class. His driver\u2019s \nlicense was suspended for 90 days. (GX 1 at 21-22; GX 5 at 2; GX 15; GX 16.) \n \n \nIn February 2006, Applicant was charged with possession of marijuana and \ndriving with a suspended or revoked driver\u2019s license. (GX 4 at 3; GX 6 at 2.) Prosecution \nwas deferred for one year, after which the charges were dismissed and the record was \nexpunged. (Tr. 40, 50-52.)  \n \n \nIn October 2007, Applicant was charged with DUI and possession of marijuana, \nafter he was stopped for driving his motorcycle 51 miles per hour (mph) in a 25-mph \nzone. He was convicted of DUI, fined, and sentenced to community service. His driver\u2019s \nlicense was suspended for one year, and he was required to attend an alcohol-\nawareness class. (GX 4 at 3; GX 5 at 2; GX 6 at 1; GX 12; GX 13; GX 14.) \n \n \nWhen Applicant submitted an SCA in October 1997, he answered \u201cYes\u201d to \nquestion 24, asking if he had ever been charged with or convicted of any offenses \nrelated to alcohol or drugs. He disclosed a DUI in December 1996, for which he was \nfined and lost his driver\u2019s license. He answered \u201cNo\u201d to question 27, asking if he had \n\n \n4 \n \n \nillegally used any controlled substance since the age of 16 or during the last seven \nyears, whichever is shorter. (GX 2 at 5.) \n \n \nWhen Applicant submitted his most recent SCA in May 2008, he answered \u201cYes\u201d \nto question 23d, asking if he had ever been charged with or convicted of any offenses \nrelated to alcohol or drugs. He disclosed his breathalyzer refusal in September 2004 \nand his DUI in September 2007, but he did not disclose his DUI arrests in February \n1977 and December 1995 or his arrest for possession of marijuana in February 2006. In \nan affidavit submitted to a security investigator in April 2010, he stated that he forgot to \nlist his 1977 and 1995 arrests on his SCA. (GX 5 at 2.) At the hearing, he testified he \nthought that he was not required to disclose the 1977 and 1995 arrests because they \nwere so far in the past. He also testified that he thought he was not required to disclose \nthe February 2006 arrest because it was expunged after one year. (Tr. 50-52.) He had \nbeen advised by his lawyer that, under state law, an expunged offense \u201cdidn\u2019t happen.\u201d \n(Tr. 34.) \n \n \nOn the same SCA, Applicant answered \u201cNo\u201d to question 24, asking if he had \nillegally used any controlled substance since the age of 16 or during the last seven \nyears. He did not disclose his marijuana use. At the hearing, he admitted that he \nintentionally falsified his answer to this question because he was concerned that it \nwould harm his career if he admitted his marijuana use. (Tr. 53.) \n \n \nIn April 2009, Applicant was intoxicated and riding his motorcycle. He was \ntraveling 35-40 miles per hour when he tried to avoid an animal in the road, lost control, \nand crashed into a tree. The police found him crawling on the ground under the tree. He \nspent a day in intensive care, a week in the hospital, and two months in rehabilitation. \nHe was charged with DUI (2nd offense), refusal to take a breathalyzer test, and \npossession of marijuana. The DUI and test refusal charges were dismissed by the \nprosecutor because of \u201cinsufficient evidence as to operation and probable cause.\u201d He \nwas convicted of the marijuana offense, placed on probation for one year, ordered to \nperform community service, and required to obtain alcohol counseling. (GX 5 at 3; GX 6 \nat 1; GX 9; GX 10; GX 11.) \n \n \nIn October 2009, Applicant was stopped for having an expired inspection sticker \nand arrested for driving on a suspended license. He was fined and ordered to pay court \ncosts. (GX 7; GX 8.) \n \n \nApplicant began court-ordered outpatient treatment in December 2009. His \ndiagnosis on admission was an unspecified adjustment disorder and alcohol abuse. He \ntold a member of the staff that he did not use marijuana, had not used it for years, and \nthat his arrest for marijuana possession occurred when he was taking marijuana to a \nfriend for medical use. (GX 17 at 1-2, 9.) He was discharged from the treatment \nprogram in February 2010. The diagnostic summary upon discharge stated that he had \nabstained from alcohol since his motorcycle accident in April 2009. The diagnostic \nsummary comments favorably on his progress but does not include a prognosis. (GX 17 \nat 16.) The credentials of his treating clinician are listed as MA (a master\u2019s degree), \n\n \n5 \n \n \nCAGS (Certificate of Advanced Graduate Studies), LMHC (Licensed Mental Health \nCounselor), and LCDP (Licensed Chemical Dependency Professional). Applicant \ncontinued to receive psychotherapy and tested negative for alcohol or drugs at about \ntwo-week intervals until March 2010. (GX 17 at 16-35.) \n \n \nApplicant received counseling from a psychologist for about six weeks before the \nhearing. His last visit was a week before the hearing. He testified he sought additional \ncounseling because he and his lawyer thought it would be beneficial to supplement his \ncourt-ordered treatment with something more recent. (Tr. 45-46.) The psychologist \nconcluded that Applicant is not alcohol dependent. The psychologist\u2019s report states that \nApplicant \u201chas done all the right things since his accident.\u201d He expresses confidence \nthat Applicant would value and honor the trust that a security clearance would place in \nhim. (AX D.) \n \n \nApplicant was interviewed by a security investigator in April 2010. The interview \nwas initiated by the investigator, not by Applicant. (Tr. 57.) Applicant executed an \naffidavit admitting that he often drove while intoxicated. He admitted that he intentionally \ndid not disclose his marijuana use on his SCA. He also admitted that he deliberately lied \nduring prior interviews about his marijuana use and the amount and frequency of his \nalcohol consumption. He ended his affidavit by stating, \u201cI lied to cover my mistakes and \nam sick of lies.\u201d (GX 5 at 5.) \n \n \nApplicant testified that he had not consumed alcohol since his motorcycle \naccident in April 2009, and he had not used marijuana since the day before his \naccident. (Tr. 41.) He testified that he admitted lying about his alcohol and drug use \nbecause he \u201chad been living with a lie for a long time,\u201d and he \u201cdidn\u2019t want to live like \nthat any more.\u201d (Tr. 26-27.) He has been participating in AA for about two years, and he \nattends AA meetings two or three times a week. (Tr. 46.)  \n \nPolicies \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended.   \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the AG. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, \nrecognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies these \nguidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \n\n \n6 \n \n \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. \nOr. 10865 \u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the \napplicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense \nhave established for issuing a clearance. \n \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in \nthe personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant \nfrom being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden \nof establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 92-1106 \nat 3, 1993 WL 545051 at *3 (App. Bd. Oct. 7, 1993).   \n \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \n \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. \n01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, \nif they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \n \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant used marijuana \u201cin at least 1974\u201d while holding a \nsecurity clearance (\u00b6 1.a). It cross-alleges the Guideline H allegations (\u00b6\u00b6 3.a and 3.b) \nthat he purchased, possessed and used marijuana from about 1970 until \u201cat least\u201d April \n2009 (\u00b6 1.b). It alleges Applicant\u2019s alcohol-related arrests in February 1977, December \n1995, August 2004, and October 2007 (\u00b6\u00b6 1.c, 1.d, 1.e, and 1.g), and his arrest for \n\n \n7 \n \n \npossession of marijuana and driving on a suspended license (\u00b6 1.f). Finally, it alleges \nthat Applicant falsified his answers to question 23 on his 2008 SCA regarding offenses \nrelated to alcohol and question 24 regarding illegal use of controlled substances (\u00b6\u00b6 1.h \nand 1.i). \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 15:  \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.  \nThe relevant disqualifying conditions under this guideline are: \n \nAG 16(a): deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant \nfacts from any personnel security questionnaire . . . ;  \nAG \u00b6 16(c): credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue \nareas that is not sufficient for an adverse determination under any other \nsingle guideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a \nwhole-person assessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the person may not \nproperly safeguard protected information; \nAG \u00b6 16(d): credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered \nunder any other guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an \nadverse determination, but which, when combined with all available \ninformation supports a whole-person assessment of questionable \njudgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to \ncomply with rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that \nthe person may not properly safeguard protected information. This \nincludes but is not limited to consideration of . . . a pattern of dishonesty or \nrule violations; and  \nAG \u00b6 16(e): personal conduct, or concealment of information about one's \nconduct, that creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or \nduress, such as . . . engaging in activities which, if known, may affect the \nperson's personal, professional, or community standing.  \n \nWhen a falsification allegation is controverted, as in this case, the Government \nhas the burden of proving it. An omission, standing alone, does not prove falsification. \nAn administrative judge must consider the record evidence as a whole to determine an \n\n \n8 \n \n \napplicant\u2019s state of mind at the time of the omission.  See ISCR Case No. 03-09483 at 4 \n(App. Bd. Nov. 17, 2004).  \n \n \nApplicant admitted deliberately falsifying his answer to question 24 on his SCA, \nregarding his illegal use of a controlled substance, and his admission is corroborated by \nthe Government\u2019s evidence. However, he denied deliberately omitting information about \nhis drug- and alcohol-related arrests and convictions. His explanations for omitting his \nDUI arrests in February 1977 and December 1995 have not been consistent. In his April \n2010 affidavit he stated that he forgot to list these two arrests, but at the hearing he \ntestified that he did not think he was required to disclose them because they happened \nso long ago.  \n \n \nApplicant presented himself at the hearing as intelligent and articulate. He has \nheld a security clearance for many years, has worked for his current employer for 32 \nyears, and has completed an SCA several times. His experience is relevant to \ndetermining whether his failure to disclose relevant information on his SCA was \ndeliberate. See ISCR Case No. 08-05637 (App. Bd. Sep. 9, 2010). Based on his \ninconsistent explanations, obvious intelligence, and level of experience, I find his \nexplanation for not disclosing the February 1977 and December 1995 arrests \nimplausible and not persuasive. On the other hand, his explanation for not disclosing \nthe drug-related arrest in February 2006 was more plausible, and it was consistent with \nhis April 2010 affidavit. Based on all the evidence, I conclude that his failure to disclose \nthe February 2006 arrest that was expunged was not an intentional falsification, but that \nhis failure to disclose the February 1977 and December 1995 arrests was intentional. \nThus, I conclude that the disqualifying condition in AG \u00b6 16(a) is established.  \n \n \nApplicant has admitted the drug- and alcohol-related conduct alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.a-1.l, and his admissions are corroborated by the evidence of record. He also \nadmitted deliberately concealing his marijuana use from medical personnel in \nDecember 2009, as alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.m. In addition to AG \u00b6 16(a), discussed above, \nhis admissions and the corroborating evidence also establish the disqualifying \nconditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(c), (d), and (e). \n \n \nSecurity concerns raised by false or misleading answers on a security clearance \napplication or during a security interview may be mitigated by showing that \u201cthe \nindividual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, concealment, or \nfalsification before being confronted with the facts.\u201d AG \u00b6 17(a). Applicant made no \neffort to correct his admissions until he was contacted by a security investigator in April \n2010. Even though his life-threatening motorcycle accident in April 2009 prompted him \nto stop drinking and using drugs, he continued his pattern of deception and denial when \nhe concealed his marijuana use during his court-ordered treatment from December \n2009 to March 2010. I conclude that AG \u00b6 17(a) is not established. \n \n \nSecurity concerns based on false or misleading answers also may be mitigated \nby showing that \u201cthe refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was \ncaused or significantly contributed to by improper or inadequate advice of authorized \n\n \n9 \n \n \npersonnel or legal counsel advising or instructing the individual specifically concerning \nthe security clearance process.\u201d This mitigating condition is not fully established unless, \n\u201cUpon being made aware of the requirement to cooperate or provide the information, \nthe individual cooperated fully and truthfully.\u201d AG \u00b6 17(b). Applicant testified that his \nfailure to disclose the February 2006 arrest was based on the legal advice he received, \ninforming him that an expunged arrest \u201cdidn\u2019t happen.\u201d Applicant subsequently \ndisclosed the arrest to the security investigator in April 2010. I conclude that AG \u00b6 17(d) \nis established for Applicant\u2019s failure to disclose the February 2006 arrest, but not for his \nfailure to disclose the arrests in February 1977 and December 1995. \n \n \nSecurity concerns based on personal conduct may be mitigated if \u201cthe offense is \nso minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is so infrequent, or it happened \nunder such unique circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on \nthe individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d AG \u00b6 17(c). Some of \nApplicant\u2019s offenses were misdemeanors and arguably minor, but his use of marijuana \nwhile holding a security clearance was a serious breach of trust. His offenses were \nnumerous and did not occur under unique circumstances. However, his last offense was \nmore than two years ago. There are no Abright line@ rules for determining when conduct \nis mitigated by the passage of time. The determination must be based on a careful \nevaluation of the totality of the evidence. See ISCR Case No. 02-24452 at 6 (App. Bd. \nAug. 4, 2004). If the evidence shows Aa significant period of time has passed without \nany evidence of misconduct,@ then an administrative judge must determine whether that \nperiod of time demonstrates Achanged circumstances or conduct sufficient to warrant a \nfinding of reform or rehabilitation.@ Id.  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s two-year period of sobriety and abstinence from drug use is \u201ca \nsignificant period of time. He has engaged in no further misconduct related to alcohol or \ndrugs. He has not, however, abandoned his pattern of denial and deception. The \nexplanation he gave the security investigator in April 2010 for omitting some of his \noffenses from his SCA was inconsistent with his explanation at the hearing. Thus, either \nhis explanation to the investigator was false or his hearing testimony was false. This \nlack of candor was recent and precludes a finding of rehabilitation for all the conduct \nalleged under this guideline. I conclude that AG \u00b6 17(c) is established for the conduct \nalleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.g, 1.k, and 1.l, but not for the falsifications alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.h, 1.i, 1.j, and 1.m. \n \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline may be mitigated if \u201cthe individual has \nacknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling to change the behavior or taken \nother positive steps to alleviate the stressors, circumstances, or factors that caused \nuntrustworthy, unreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely \nto recur.\u201d AG \u00b6 17(d). Applicant has acknowledged his drug and alcohol problems and \nobtained counseling, both court-ordered and voluntary, to help him change his behavior. \nI conclude that this mitigating condition is established for his conduct related to drug and \nalcohol use, but it is not established for his lack of candor alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.h, 1.i, 1.j, \nand 1.m. \n \n\n \n10 \n \n \n \nFinally, security concerns based on personal conduct may be mitigated if \u201cthe \nindividual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability to exploitation, \nmanipulation, or duress.\u201d AG \u00b6 17(e). This mitigating condition is established by \nApplicant\u2019s full disclosure of his drug and alcohol history to his supervisor. \n \nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption \n \n \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant consumed alcohol, at times to excess and to the \npoint of intoxication, from 1969, when he was in high school, until \u201cat least\u201d April 2009 (\u00b6 \n2.a). It also cross-alleges the conduct alleged under Guideline E in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c, 1.d, 1.e, \n1.g, and 1.k (\u00b6 2.b.). Finally, it alleges that Applicant received outpatient treatment from \nDecember 2009 to March 2010 for alcohol abuse (\u00b6 2.c). The concern under this \nguideline is set out in AG \u00b6 21 as follows: \u201cExcessive alcohol consumption often leads \nto the exercise of questionable judgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability and trustworthiness.\u201d The relevant disqualifying \nconditions are: \n \nAG \u00b6 22(a): alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving \nwhile under the influence . . . , regardless of whether the individual is \ndiagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent; \n \nAG \u00b6 22(c): habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of \nimpaired judgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as \nan alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent; \n \nAG \u00b6 22(d): diagnosis by a duly qualified medical professional (e.g., \nphysician, clinical psychologist, or psychiatrist) of alcohol abuse or alcohol \ndependence;  \n \nAG \u00b6 22(e): evaluation of alcohol abuse or alcohol dependence by a \nlicensed clinical social worker who is a staff member of a recognized \nalcohol treatment program; and \n \nAG \u00b6 22(f): relapse after diagnosis of alcohol abuse or dependence and \ncompletion of an alcohol rehabilitation program. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s history of DUI arrests and convictions, admitted binge drinking, and \nalcohol-induced impairment of his judgment establishes AG \u00b6\u00b6 22(a) and (c). His \ndiagnosis of alcohol abuse by a clinical psychologist in March 2011 establishes AG \u00b6 \n22(d). His diagnosis of alcohol abuse during his court-ordered treatment from December \n2009 to March 2010 was not by a licensed clinical social worker, but her credentials \ninclude a master\u2019s degree, CAGS, LMHC, and LCDP (defined above in my findings of \nfact). AG \u00b6\u00b6 22(d) and (e) are not limited to the specific credentials that are enumerated \nin those disqualifying conditions. Instead, AG \u00b6\u00b6 22(d) and (e) \u201ccontemplate a broad \nrange of providers who, by education and by position, are qualified to diagnose and \n\n \n11 \n \n \ntreat alcohol dependence and other substance abuse disorders.\u201d ISCR Case No. 07-\n00558 at 5 (App. Bd. Apr. 7, 2008). I conclude that AG \u00b6 22(e) is established. \n \n \nAlthough Applicant was ordered to attend alcohol awareness classes in August \n2004 and October 2007, his first rehabilitation program, resulting in a diagnosis of \nalcohol abuse, was from December 2009 to March 2010. He has maintained sobriety \nand abstained from drug use since April 2009. I conclude that AG \u00b6 22(f) is not \nestablished. \n \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline may be mitigated if \u201cso much time has \npassed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it happened under such unusual \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on the individual's \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d AG \u00b6 23(a). This mitigating \ncondition is established for the reasons set out in the above discussion of AG \u00b6 17(c). \n \n \nSecurity concerns also may be mitigated if \u201cthe individual acknowledges his or \nher alcoholism or issues of alcohol abuse, provides evidence of actions taken to \novercome this problem, and has established a pattern of abstinence (if alcohol \ndependent) or responsible use (if an alcohol abuser).\u201d AG \u00b6 23(b). This mitigating \ncondition is established for the reasons set out in the above discussion of AG \u00b6 17(d).  \n \n \nFinally, security concerns under this guideline may be mitigated if \u201cthe individual \nhas successfully completed inpatient or outpatient counseling or rehabilitation along \nwith any required aftercare, has demonstrated a clear and established pattern of \nmodified consumption or abstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations, \nsuch as participation in meetings of Alcoholics Anonymous or a similar organization and \nhas received a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified medical professional or a \nlicensed clinical social worker who is a staff member of a recognized alcohol treatment \nprogram.\u201d AG \u00b6 23(d). This mitigating is partially established for the reasons set out in \nthe above discussion of AG \u00b6 17(d), but the final element, a favorable prognosis, is not \nestablished. \n \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement \n \n \nThe SOR alleges Applicant purchased, possessed, and used marijuana, with \nvarying frequency from about 1970 to \u201cat least\u201d April 2009 (\u00b6\u00b6 3.a and 3.b). It also \ncross-alleges the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.f, and 1.k (\u00b6 3.c).  \n \n \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 24: AUse of an illegal drug or \nmisuse of a prescription drug can raise questions about an individual's reliability and \ntrustworthiness, both because it may impair judgment and because it raises questions \nabout a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations.@ AG \u00b6 \n24(a)(1) explains that Guideline H encompasses Adrugs, materials, and other chemical \ncompounds identified and listed in the Controlled Substances Act of 1970, as amended \n(e.g., marijuana or cannabis, depressants, narcotics, stimulants, and hallucinogens).\u201d  \n \n\n \n12 \n \n \nThe evidence establishes the following disqualifying conditions under this \nguideline: \n \nAG \u00b6 25(a): any drug abuse, defined in AG \u00b6 24(b) as \u201cthe illegal use of a \ndrug or use of a legal drug in a manner that deviates from approved \nmedical direction;  \n \nAG \u00b6 25(c): illegal drug possession, including cultivation, processing, \nmanufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of drug \nparaphernalia; and \nAG 25(g): any illegal drug use after being granted a security clearance. \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline may be mitigated if \u201cthe behavior \nhappened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened under such circumstances that \nit is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d AG \u00b6 26(a). This mitigating condition is established \nfor the reasons set out in the above discussion of AG \u00b6 17(c). \n \nSecurity concerns also may be mitigated by \u201ca demonstrated intent not to abuse \nany drugs in the future, such as: (1) disassociation from drug-using associates and \ncontacts; (2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; (3) an \nappropriate period of abstinence; and (4) a signed statement of intent with automatic \nrevocation of clearance for any violation.\u201d AG \u00b6 26(b). The evidence establishes AG \u00b6 \n26(b)(3), but there is no evidence supporting AG \u00b6 26(b)(1), (2), or (4). \n \nSecurity concerns also may be mitigated by Asatisfactory completion of a \nprescribed drug treatment program, including but not limited to rehabilitation and \naftercare requirements, without recurrence of abuse, and a favorable prognosis by a \nduly qualified medical professional.@ AG \u00b6 26(d). Applicant\u2019s court-ordered treatment \nprogram from December 2009 to March 2010 was provided by medical professionals \nqualified to treat drug abuse, but no treatment specifically aimed at drug abuse was \nprovided, because Applicant concealed his marijuana use from his treating clinician. \nThus, this mitigating condition is not established. \n \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct \n \n \nThe SOR cross-alleges the conduct alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.l under this \nguideline. The concern raised by criminal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 30: \u201cCriminal \nactivity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. By its \nvery nature, it calls into question a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, \nrules and regulations.\u201d \n \nApplicant\u2019s record of criminal conduct related to drug abuse and alcohol \nconsumption raises two disqualifying conditions under this guideline: AG \u00b6 31(a) (\u201ca \nsingle serious crime or multiple lesser offenses\u201d) and AG \u00b6 31(c) (\u201callegation or \n\n \n13 \n \n \nadmission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was formally charged, \nformally prosecuted, or convicted\u201d). Applicant\u2019s intentional falsifications alleged in SOR \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.h, 1.i, and 1.j were serious offenses within the meaning of AG \u00b6 31(a). It is a felony, \npunishable by a fine or imprisonment for not more than five years, or both, to knowingly \nand willfully make any materially false, fictitious, or fraudulent statement or \nrepresentation in any matter within the jurisdiction of the executive branch of the \nGovernment of the United States. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001. Security clearances are matters \nwithin the jurisdiction of the executive branch of the Government of the United States. A \ndeliberately false answer on a security clearance application or in response to \nquestioning by a security investigator is a serious crime within the meaning of Guideline \nJ. Applicant\u2019s false answers on his SCA and deliberate concealment of his drug use \nduring the September 2008 interview with a security investigator raise the disqualifying \ncondition in AG \u00b6 31(a), \n \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline may be mitigated by evidence that \u201cso \nmuch time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it happened under \nsuch unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d AG \u00b6 32(a). Security concerns \nalso may be mitigated if \u201cthere is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not \nlimited to the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or \nrestitution, job training or higher education, good employment record, or constructive \ncommunity involvement.\u201d AG \u00b6 32(d). For the reasons set out in the above discussions \nof AG \u00b6\u00b6 17(c) and (d), I conclude that these two mitigating conditions are established \nfor the conduct alleged in SOR\u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.g, but not for the falsifications alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.h, 1.i, and 1.j. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guidelines E, G, H, and J in my whole-person analysis. Some of the \n\n \n14 \n \n \nfactors in AG \u00b6 2(a) were addressed under those guidelines, but some warrant \nadditional comment. \n \n \nApplicant is a mature, intelligent adult. He is a talented and dedicated employee. \nHe served honorably in the U.S. Navy at a time when military service was not popular. \nHis service included duty aboard a Navy ship in a combat zone. He has worked for his \ncurrent employer for 32 years and is highly regarded by his supervisor. He has held a \nclearance since May 1998. After a life-threatening accident in April 2009, he stopped \ndrinking alcohol and using drugs. On the other hand, his many years of marijuana use \nwhile holding a clearance was a serious breach of trust. He falsified his SCA in May \n2008. He deceived medical professionals in 2009 by concealing his marijuana use. He \ngave a security investigator an explanation for not disclosing his full criminal record that \nwas not consistent with his testimony at the hearing. His lack of candor raises security \nconcerns that have not been mitigated. \n \n \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guidelines E, G, \nH, and J, and evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude \nApplicant has mitigated the security concerns based on his alcohol consumption and \ndrug involvement, but he has not mitigated the security concerns based on personal \nconduct and criminal conduct. Accordingly, I conclude he has not carried his burden of \nshowing that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to continue his eligibility for \naccess to classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline E (Personal Conduct):  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.g: \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.h-1.j: \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.k-1.l: \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.m:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline G (Alcohol Consumption): \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.c: \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 3, Guideline H (Drug Involvement):  \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 3.a-3.c: \n \n \n \nFOR Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 4, Guideline J (Criminal Conduct):  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph a: \n \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n\n \n15 \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to continue \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance.

Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance is granted. \n \nOn June 8, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued to \nApplicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under \nGuideline F. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of \nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative \nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective \nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on June 26, 2009, and requested a \nhearing before an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on July 15, 2009. \nDOHA issued a Notice of Hearing on July 21, 2009. I convened the hearing as \nscheduled on August 17, 2009. The Government offered Exhibits (GE) 1 through 3. \n \n1 \n \n \nSeptember 4, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n \n                                                          \nApplicant did not object and they were admitted. Applicant testified and offered Exhibits \n(AE) A through H, which were admitted without objection. DOHA received the transcript \nof the hearing (Tr.) on August 24, 2009.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant admitted to the allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 1.c and 1.d. of the SOR. He \ndenied the remaining allegations of the SOR. His admissions are incorporated herein. In \naddition, after a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I \nmake the following findings of fact. \n \n \nApplicant is 43 years old and began work with his current employer, a federal \ncontractor, in June 2009. He retired from the Navy in August 2005, after 21 years of \nservice, in the rank of E-7. He married in 1991 and separated from his wife in 1998. \nThey divorced in 2003. They have two children, ages 16 and 14. Applicant remarried in \nJuly 2007 to a German national who resides in Germany. They do not currently live \ntogether, but visit each other several times a year.1  \n \n \nApplicant disputed with the credit bureau the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e through 1.s. All \nof these debts have subsequently been removed from his credit report. The debts were \nlisted for a person with a different middle initial, different social security number, a \nspouse listed that was not Applicant\u2019s, and an address in a different state. Applicant \nwas on active duty, living in a different state, when many of these debts were incurred. I \nfind these debts do not belong to Applicant.2  \n \n \nApplicant admits the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.d are his debts. He explained \nthat when he and his first wife separated and later divorced, he assumed all of the \ndebts, totaling approximately $60,000. He stated she quit work a few months prior to \ntheir divorce, so the court would award her half of his income at the time. He slowly \nwhittled away at paying off the debts. When he retired in 2005, he was out of work for \napproximately two to three months. He used his savings to support himself during this \ntime. He had been earning approximately $60,000 in gross pay while in the Navy. His \nnew job paid $39,000. His retirement income was $1,500 a month and $800 was used \nfor child support. He got behind in his bills and used credit cards. He also found himself \nproviding money to his mother. He later learned she was using the money to purchase \nunnecessary items. Upon learning this he ceased providing her money.3  \n \n \nIn February 2007, Applicant sought assistance from a debt consolidator. He was \nadvised that they could not help him and he should file for bankruptcy. He met with a \nlawyer and started the paperwork to file for bankruptcy. His lawyer told him to stop \npaying all of his delinquent bills. He followed her advice. In April 2007, Applicant \n \n1 Tr. 37-41. \n \n2 Tr. 24-37; AE B. \n \n3 Tr. 38, 47-53, 82. \n\n \n3 \n \n \n                                                          \nobtained a better paying job, now earning $55,000 annually. He withdrew his \nbankruptcy petition and started to pay some of his smaller delinquent debts. His annual \npay increased incrementally to $68,000 in May 2009. In June 2009, he started a new \njob with an annual salary of $85,000.4  \n \n \nWhile still on active duty, Applicant took out a loan (1.c, $24,000) that had a \nsmaller interest rate than his debts and paid some of the debts with this loan money. He \nthought he would be able to maintain the loan payments when he retired, but was \nunable to do so when he did not get a job right away. He set up a payment plan in April \n2008 to pay $150 a month through an automatic withdrawal from his account. By setting \nup the automatic payment, the creditor agreed to discontinue charging interest on the \naccount. Applicant has been making consistent payments on this debt.5  \n \n \n \nThe debt in SOR \u00b6 1.a is a credit card debt that carried over from Applicant\u2019s \ndivorce. He also used this credit card to take a cash advance to help his mother. He set \nup a payment plan in February 2009 to have $200 automatically withdrawn from his \naccount each month. No interest is accruing on the debt based on his arrangement with \nthe creditor.6  \n \n \nThe debt in SOR \u00b6 1.b is from a line of credit that Applicant obtained. He owes \napproximately $2,700 and set up a payment plan in June 2009 to have $100 withdrawn \nfrom his account each month. Applicant thought he previously set up an automatic \nwithdrawal, but realized the creditor only withdrew the payment for one month. He \nintends to contact the creditor and correct the oversight. I find Applicant to be credible in \nthat this was a mere oversight.7  \n \n \nApplicant contacted the creditor listed in the SOR \u00b61.d. They had a payment \nagreement that he would make three monthly payments of $380 to resolve the debt. \nApplicant later learned from the creditor that the debt was sold to a collection company. \nWhen he spoke to the original creditor he was advised that the company was attempting \nto buy the debt back and resolve it directly with him, but it would take approximately 90 \ndays to complete. Applicant admitted he is somewhat confused about how to resolve \nthe debt, not knowing if he should wait the 90 days and deal directly with the original \ncreditor or attempt to resolve it with the collection company. He thought he had a \npayment plan, but it was with the original creditor, who no longer owns the debt. He \nintends to resolve the debt once it is sorted out which company he should deal with.8  \n \n \n4 Tr. 42-45, 82, 85-86. \n \n5 Tr. 44-48, 68-71; AE C and D. \n \n6 Tr. 51-54, 64-66; AE E. \n \n7 Tr. 54-57, 66-68; AE F. \n \n8 Tr. 58-61, 71-72, 74. \n\n \n4 \n \n \n                                                          \n \nApplicant provided information that he has paid other delinquent debts that were \nnot alleged. He also has a credit card that he uses for both business and personal use. \nHe has a balance of approximately $4,700. He intends to start making larger payments \ntowards this debt. He is current on the payments on this credit card.9 \n \n \nApplicant has had minimal financial counseling, which was limited to filing for \nbankruptcy. Applicant\u2019s salary has increased since starting his new job. He intends to \nuse the extra income to expedite paying his delinquent debts. His goal is to have all of \nhis delinquent debts paid off by December 2010. He maintains a budget on a \nspreadsheet and records his income and expenses.10 \n \nApplicant and his wife take driving trips, visiting different countries in Europe, \nwhen they visit each other. They alternate which one pays for the trip. Applicant shares \na residence with another person and splits the rents.11 \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common-sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \n \n9 Tr. 72, 7-80; AE G. This information was not considered for disqualifying purposes, but is \nconsidered when evaluating Applicant\u2019s complete financial situation and when analyzing the \u201cwhole \nperson.\u201d \n \n10 Tr. 97. \n \n11 Tr. 88-96. \n\n \n5 \n \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG & 18:   \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. I have \nconsidered all of them under AG & 19 and especially considered the following: \n \n(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \nApplicant has been unable or unwilling to pay his debts for a period of time. I find \nthe above disqualifying conditions have been raised.  \n\n \n6 \n \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. I have considered all of the mitigating \nconditions under AG \u00b6 20 and especially considered the following: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control;  \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue.  \n \n \nApplicant successfully disputed the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e through 1.s with the \ncredit bureaus because they did not belong to him. The debts were removed from his \ncredit report. I find mitigating condition (e) applies to those debts. Applicant began \nhaving financial problems when he went through a divorce and was unemployed and \nunderemployed for a period of time. These were conditions beyond his control. When \nhe obtained a better paying job, he set up payment plans for his delinquent debts and \nhas been making consistent payments. He started the paperwork to file for bankruptcy, \nbut withdrew from it when his income increased and he was able to make payments on \nthe debts. He has consistently paid his child support. Applicant now earns a good \nincome and all but one delinquent debt is presently being paid through a payment plan. \nApplicant is ready to make payments to the appropriate entity once it is resolved \nbetween the original creditor and the collection company. Applicant\u2019s debts are recent \nbecause he is still resolving them. I find mitigating condition (a) does not apply because \nhe is presently making payments on his delinquent debts and is still resolving one with \nthe creditor. The causes of Appellant\u2019s financial problems were his divorce and debts \nremaining from it, a period of unemployment, and a period of underemployment. He has \nbeen paying some of the smaller debts he owed, and once his income increased, he set \nup payment plans to resolve the larger delinquent debts. I find mitigating condition (b) \napplies because the conditions that resulted in the financial problems were beyond his \ncontrol and he acted responsibly under the circumstances. I also find that he initiated a \n\n \n7 \n \n \ngood-faith effort to pay his overdue creditors and resolve his debts. He has payment \nplans to resolve his debts. He intends on expediting his payment schedule now that his \nsalary has increased. He is ready to resolve the remaining delinquent debt once it is \ndetermined which entity he should pay. I find mitigating conditions (c) and (d) apply.  \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall common-sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant served his country in the \nNavy for 21 years. He went through a divorce that affected his finances negatively. \nWhen he was discharged from the Navy he was unemployed and underemployed for a \nperiod of time. Since his salary has increased, he has been consistently making \npayments on all of his delinquent debts except one. He will set up a payment plan on \nthe remaining debt once it is determined who he should pay. I find Applicant is not a \nsecurity risk. Overall, the record evidence leaves me with no questions or doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude \nApplicant \nmitigated \nthe \nsecurity \nconcerns \narising \nfrom \nFinancial \nConsiderations.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.s: \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n\n \n8 \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly in the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nCarol G.

On June 10, 2009, DOHA issued to\nApplicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging facts which, if proven, raise security\nNovember 30, 2009\n\n The revised Adjudicative Guidelines were approved by the President on December 29, 2005, and were\n2\nimplemented by the Department of Defense on September 1, 2006. Pending official revision of the Directive,\nthey supercede the guidelines listed in Enclosure 2 to the Directive.\n I sustained Department Counsel\u2019s objection to Ax. A and excluded it from the record. (Tr. 34, 40 - 46)\n3\n Tr. 47 - 52.\n4\n2\nconcerns addressed in the revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG)  under Guideline J\n2\n(criminal conduct) and Guideline E (personal conduct).\nApplicant timely responded to the SOR and requested a hearing. The case was\nassigned to me on July 24, 2009. I convened a hearing on August 26, 2009, at which\nthe parties appeared as scheduled. The government presented four exhibits (Gx. 1 - 4),\nwhich were admitted without objection. Applicant testified on his own behalf and\nproffered three exhibits (Ax. A - C), of which only Ax. B and C were admitted.  Further,\n3\nas to Ax. C, I sustained Department Counsel\u2019s objection to the admissibility of parts of\nthat exhibit.  DOHA received the transcript of hearing (Tr.) on September 3, 2009. \n4\nFindings of Fact\nUnder Guideline J, the government alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a that Applicant was\narrested in August 2001 and charged with (1) first degree assault, a felony; (2) risk of\ninjury to a child, a felony; and (3) cruelty to persons, a misdemeanor. It was further\nalleged that, in July 2002, he pleaded nolo contendere to risk of injury to a child, for\nwhich he was sentenced to 10 years in jail, \u201csuspended after six years, and probation\nfor five years.\u201d He also pleaded nolo contendere to cruelty to persons, and was\nsentenced to one year in jail. The government also alleged under Guideline J that\nApplicant was arrested in August 1999 and charged with assault and battery of a family\nmember, which was dismissed (SOR \u00b6 1.c); and that Applicant was arrested in October\n1999 for failure to appear, which was also dismissed (SOR \u00b6 1.b).\nUnder Guideline E, the government alleged that, as a result of his arrest and\nconviction for the conduct alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a, in August 2001, Applicant was\ndischarged from the U.S. Navy under other than honorable conditions (SOR \u00b6 2.a); and\nthat, in about October 1997, while in the U.S. Navy, he was counseled for violating\nproper procedures for the handling and storage of classified materials (SOR \u00b6 2.b). The\ngovernment also cross-alleged the criminal conduct cited in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a - 1.c (SOR \u00b6\n2.c)\nApplicant admitted all of the SOR allegations. In addition to the facts established\nthrough his admissions, and after reviewing the pleadings, the transcript, and exhibits, I\nhave made the following findings of relevant fact.\nApplicant is a 41-year-old electronics test technician, who has been employed by\na defense contractor since October 2007. Applicant served in the United States Navy\nsubmarine service from February 1988 until August 2001. He was a Petty Officer First\nClass when he was discharged. Before enlisting in the Navy, Applicant studied\n\n A one-year sentence for the misdemeanor was served concurrently with the 10-year sentence for the\n5\nfelonies.\n SOR \u00b6 2.a alleged that the discharge occurred after Applicant was convicted; however, his conviction did\n6\nnot occur until July 2002. Nonetheless, it is clear that Applicant was discharged as a result of the August 2001\nincident in which his son was injured. (Tr. 63)\n3\ncomputer engineering in college for two years. He is currently enrolled  in a bachelor of\nscience business degree program, in which he has made the Dean\u2019s List each\nsemester. Applicant also enjoys an excellent reputation at work for his expertise and\nreliability. (Ax. B; Ax. C)\nApplicant and his current wife have been married since November 2005. A\nprevious marriage began in October 1997 and ended in divorce in October 2003. In\n1993, Applicant fathered a son with a third woman to whom he has never been married.\nThat child was diagnosed as suffering from a form of autism. Applicant characterized\nthe child as intellectually high functioning, but also testified the child is mildly retarded\nwith some delayed speech development. Applicant also stated the child suffers from\nanxiety attacks and occasional hallucinations. (Tr. 69 - 71)\nPrior to August 2001, Applicant\u2019s only extended visitation with his son was in the\nsummer of 1999. In the summer of 2001, before Applicant returned from an overseas\ndeployment, his ex-wife and the boy\u2019s mother arranged for the boy to visit Applicant and\nhis ex-wife for about eight weeks. About half way through the visit, Applicant, his ex-\nwife, and the boy traveled to visit Applicant\u2019s wife\u2019s family. (Gx. 3; Tr. 66 - 69)\nOn August 3, 2001, Applicant brought the boy to a local emergency room\nbecause the boy had been burned by hot water over 30% of his body. Medical\npersonnel also determined that the boy had been burned by cigarettes, had been\nbeaten, had two black eyes, was emaciated, and was missing part of an ear. Local\npolice and the Naval Investigative Service were advised of these facts, and Applicant\nwas eventually charged with the two felonies and a misdemeanor, as alleged in SOR \u00b6\n1.a. In July 2002, after pleading nolo contendere to one felony and the misdemeanor,\nApplicant was sentenced to 10 years in jail.  He served six years in prison, was\n5\nreleased in August 2007, and is on supervised probation until 2012. Part of Applicant\u2019s\nsentence included an evaluation of his need for anger management counseling. He\ntestified that he was not referred for such counseling. Applicant further claimed that he\nis being considered for early release from his probation. (Gx. 1; Gx. 2; Gx. 3; Gx. 4; Tr.\n79 - 82) \nApplicant\u2019s Navy career was generally outstanding. His performance evaluations,\nhis numerous personal awards, and other citations reflect hard work and dedication\nsuperior to his peers at each paygrade. However, as a result of the charges against\nhim,  Applicant was discharged from the Navy under other than honorable conditions.\n6\nApplicant insisted that he was wrongfully accused and convicted. He averred\nthat, if he had held his son under hot water long enough to be severely burned, his own\nhands would have also been burned. Applicant admitted that he had, on occasion,\n\n See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988).\n7\n Directive. 6.3.\n8\n4\ndisciplined his son by hitting him with a belt, and that his wife also used corporal\npunishment on the boy. (Tr. 71 - 73) Applicant did not, however, directly address or\nexplain the bruises, cigarette burns, and other damage inflicted on his son. He further\nclaimed that his attorney did not have Applicant\u2019s best interests at heart. Applicant\ncollaterally attacked his conviction for ineffective assistance of counsel, but his habeas\ncorpus petition was apparently unsuccessful. (Tr. 54 - 58)\nIn August 1999, Applicant and his first wife had an argument during which she\ncalled the police and had him charged with assault and battery. In October 1999,\nApplicant was also charged with failure to appear in court to answer the charge.\nHowever, the failure to appear charge was dismissed because Applicant had been at\nsea the day of his hearing. The assault charge was also dismissed. (Gx.4; Tr. 59 - 61)\nIn October 1997, while a student at a Navy training facility, Applicant was\ncounseled for violating procedures for the proper handling and storage of classified\ninformation. Applicant knowingly removed classified study materials from the secure\nclassroom area so that he could study them without restriction as to time or location.\n(Tr. 62)\nPolicies\nA security clearance decision is intended to resolve whether it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest  for an applicant to either receive or continue to\n7\nhave access to classified information. Each decision must be a fair, impartial, and\ncommonsense determination based on examination of all available relevant and\nmaterial information,  and consideration of the pertinent criteria and adjudication policies\n8\nin the revised Adjudicative Guidelines. Decisions must also reflect consideration of the\nfactors listed in \u00b6 2(a) of the new guidelines. Commonly referred to as the \u201cwhole\nperson\u201d concept, those factors are:\n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nThe presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not, by itself,\nconclusive. However, specific applicable guidelines should be followed whenever a case\ncan be measured against them as they represent policy guidance governing the grant or\ndenial of access to classified information. In this case, the pleadings and the information\n\n See Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, 531.\n9\n See Egan; Revised Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 2(b).\n10\n5\npresented by the parties require consideration of the security concerns and adjudicative\nfactors addressed under AG \u00b6 15 (Guideline E - Personal Conduct) and AG \u00b6 30\n(Guideline J - Criminal Conduct).\nThe government bears the initial burden of producing admissible information on\nwhich it based the preliminary decision to deny or revoke a security clearance for an\napplicant. Additionally, the government must be able to prove controverted facts alleged\nin the SOR. If the government meets its burden, it then falls to the applicant to refute,\nextenuate or mitigate the government\u2019s case. Because no one has a \u201cright\u201d to a security\nclearance, an applicant bears a heavy burden of persuasion.  A person who has access\n9\nto classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with the government based\non trust and confidence. Thus, the government has a compelling interest in ensuring\neach applicant possesses the requisite judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness of one\nwho will protect the national interests as his or her own. The \u201cclearly consistent with the\nnational interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any reasonable doubt about an\napplicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the government.10\nAnalysis\nCriminal Conduct\nThe government\u2019s information is sufficient to support the allegation in SOR \u00b6 1.a\nthat, in 2001, Applicant was convicted of two charges stemming from physical abuse of\nhis son, an autistic 8-year-old child with special needs. Available information further\nshowed that he spent six years in jail, was released in 2007, and will be on supervised\nprobation until 2012. However, as to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.c, other than the fact that\nApplicant was charged on two other occasions with unrelated criminal conduct and\nthose charges were dismissed, available information does not show that he actually\nengaged in criminal conduct on those occasions. \nNonetheless, available information is sufficient to establish disqualifying security\nconcerns about Applicant\u2019s criminal conduct. As stated in AG \u00b6 30, \u201c[c]riminal activity\ncreates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability and trustworthiness. By its very\nnature, it calls into question a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules\nand regulations.\u201d The established facts pertaining to Applicant\u2019s criminal conduct require\napplication of the disqualifying conditions at AG \u00b6 31(a) (a single serious crime or\nmultiple lesser offenses), AG \u00b6 31(c) (allegation or admission of criminal conduct,\nregardless of whether the person was formally charged, formally prosecuted or\nconvicted), and AG \u00b6 31(d) (individual is currently on parole or probation).\nI have also considered the potential applicability to these facts of the mitigating\nconditions listed under AG \u00b6 32. Applicant points to his excellent military record, his\nexcellent reputation and record at work, and his academic accomplishments as\n\n6\nevidence of his current good judgment and rehabilitation. He also points to the absence\nof any adverse or improper conduct since 2001. However, Applicant was incarcerated\nfrom 2001 until 2007, and he will be on supervised probation until 2012. Despite being a\nmodel prisoner, any claim of good behavior or rehabilitation is devalued by the fact that\nApplicant\u2019s behavior has been closely controlled for the past eight years by a state\nprison system. Notwithstanding the positive information about Applicant\u2019s educational\npursuits since his release, I conclude that the record does not support application of the\nmitigating conditions at AG \u00b6 32(a) (so much time has elapsed since the criminal\nbehavior happened, or it happened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely\nto recur or does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment) or AG \u00b6 32(d) (there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not\nlimited to the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or\nrestitution, job training or higher education, good employment record, or constructive\ncommunity involvement). \nAs to application of the mitigating condition at AG \u00b6 32(b) (the person was\npressured or coerced into committing the act and those pressures are no longer present\nin the person's life;), Applicant did not address his current circumstances relative to any\ncontact with his son. He has not received any anger management counseling or taken\nother steps to address the reasons he mistreated his son. Applicant also claimed that\nhe did not commit the offenses of which he was convicted. However, the information he\npresented was insufficient to outweigh the fact that a state court had enough information\nto warrant a severe prison and probation sentence. Accordingly, the mitigating condition\nat AG \u00b6 32(c) (evidence that the person did not commit the offense) does not apply.\nBased on all of the foregoing, I conclude the Applicant has not mitigated the security\nconcerns about his criminal conduct.\nPersonal Conduct \nThe government\u2019s information is also sufficient to support allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6\n2.a and 2.b. As to SOR \u00b6 2.c, the government\u2019s information supports only that portion of\nthe allegation that refers to Applicant\u2019s arrest and conviction alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a.\nApplicant\u2019s conduct was severe enough to end his military career. As with one\u2019s\nsuitability to hold a security clearance, suitability for military service is grounded, in large\nmeasure, by reliability, character, and judgment. The conduct that resulted in\nApplicant\u2019s conviction and prison sentence (the deliberate beating and neglect of a child\nwith special needs) reflected a severe flaw in his character and judgment that cannot be\novercome by a record of good behavior while in prison or on probation. Although dated,\nhis 1997 security violation is part of the whole record that must be considered when\nassessing whether Applicant\u2019s conduct falls within the security concern expressed at\nAG \u00b6 15, as follows:\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful\nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other\nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\n\n See footnote 8, supra.\n11\n See footnote 10, supra. \n12\n7\nMore specifically, available information about his security clearance supports\nconsideration of the disqualifying condition at AG \u00b6 16(c) (credible adverse information\nin several adjudicative issue areas that is not sufficient for an adverse determination\nunder any other single guideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a\nwhole-person assessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability,\nlack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other\ncharacteristics indicating that the person may not properly safeguard protected\ninformation). By itself, the violation is dated and isolated; however, taken in context with\nall of the other information about Applicant\u2019s criminal conduct and his apparent lack of\nremorse or acceptance of responsibility for his conduct, AG \u00b6 16(c) applies.\nOf the relevant mitigating conditions listed at AG \u00b6 17 \u2013 AG \u00b6 17(c) (the offense\nis so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is so infrequent, or it\nhappened under such unique circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast\ndoubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment) and AG \u00b6 17(d)\n(the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling to change the\nbehavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the stressors, circumstances, or\nfactors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such\nbehavior is unlikely to recur) \u2013 none apply. The behavior in question was cruel, violent,\nand, perhaps most important, a breach of trust and care between a father and his child.\nIt was not minor. These facts speak to a fatal flaw in Applicant\u2019s judgment and\ntrustworthiness that preclude mitigation, at least while he is still on probation. \nWhole Person Concept\nI have evaluated the facts presented and have applied the appropriate\nadjudicative factors under Guidelines E and J. I have also reviewed the record before\nme in the context of the whole person factors listed in AG \u00b6 2(a). Applicant is 41 years\nold and presumed to be a mature adult. He served his country honorably for most of his\nadult life, and he has been working hard since his release from prison. Further, his work\nrecord was very good and he is establishing an excellent academic record through his\ncollege studies. However, in response to the adverse information about his criminal\nconduct, he has not accepted responsibility or acknowledged the seriousness of the\nevents that resulted in a six-year prison stay and his current probationary status. A fair\nand commonsense assessment  of all available information bearing on Applicant\u2019s past\n11\nconduct and current circumstances shows he has failed to address satisfactorily the\ngovernment\u2019s doubts about his ability or willingness to protect the government\u2019s\ninterests as his own. Because protection of the national interest is paramount in these\ndeterminations, such doubts must be resolved in favor of the government.  \n12\n\n8\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by section\nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline J:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraphs 1.b - 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline E:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 2.a - 2.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the foregoing, it is not clearly consistent with the national interest\nto continue Applicant\u2019s access to classified information.

The action was taken under Executive Order 10865,\nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended;\nDepartment of Defense (DoD) Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the\nadjudicative guidelines (AG) implemented in September 2006. \nApplicant timely answered the SOR, admitted the debts alleged in the SOR,  and\nrequested a hearing. DOHA assigned the case to me on December 14, 2010. A Notice\nof Hearing was issued on December 23, 2010, and the case was heard on February 8,\n2011. Department Counsel offered eight exhibits, which were admitted without objection\nas Government Exhibits (GE) 1-8. Applicant testified and submitted exhibits AE A\nthrough AE J at the hearing, which were admitted. I kept the record open at Applicant\u2019s\nrequest, and he submitted AE K and L, which were admitted without objection. DOHA\nreceived the hearing transcript (Tr.) on February 16, 2011. Based on a review of the\nFebruary 28, 2011\n\n2\npleadings, testimony, and exhibits, I find Applicant failed to meet his burden regarding\nthe security concerns raised. Security clearance is denied.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a single 27-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He\ngraduated from high school in 2002. He attended one semester of college. Applicant\nhas one child, who is seven years old, from a previous relationship. He has worked for\nhis current employer since August 2008. (Tr. 19) He believes he has an interim security\nclearance. (Tr. 26)\nFinancial\nApplicant bought a car in 2002. He had just graduated from high school. He\nobtained a loan from a credit union for approximately $5,600. He bought a 1992 vehicle\nbut after just three weeks, his car was totaled in an accident. This was not his fault. He\nrecalls that he received $3,300 for the car from insurance. He did not use the money to\npay for the car loan. (Tr. 55) He did not arrange a payment plan. (SOR 1.c) (GE 3)\nIn January 2004, Applicant had his tax returns prepared by a Rapid Refund\ngroup who worked out of a liquor store. He paid them a fee of $200 and they prepared\nhis tax returns. He was given a sum of approximately $5,000 or $6,000 based on an\nexpected tax refund. However, he learned a few months later that an error was made\nand that he owed the money to the tax group. He had spent the money buying\nfurnishings for his apartment. (Tr. 35) Thus, he did not have the money to return to the\ntax group. He recalls that the group took an amount each year from him from his tax\nrefunds. He believes he also paid on the account, but could not provide any\ndocumentation. (SOR 1.b) However, a recent credit report shows a balance of $2,811.\n(GE 6)\nIn 2005, Applicant purchased another vehicle for $10,000. However, he returned\nthe car a few days later because a \u201ccigarette tray\u201d was missing. (Tr. 64) He had not\nmade a down payment. The dealership gave him a different truck that he thought was a\nloaner until he would get his original car back. He kept the truck for 30 days and he\nlearned he was then responsible for the truck. (Tr 67) He did not want this particular\ntype of truck so he returned the truck to the dealership. Applicant did not make any\npayments on the vehicle. He now owes $13,550. (SOR 1.d) He recalls a year ago he\nwas offered a settlement of $8,000 but could not afford it. \nApplicant was employed during these years. After high school, he worked as a\ntire technician until 2005. He then started work as a security officer. (Tr. 22) He was\nunemployed from September 2006 until March 2007. (Tr. 22) He took available\ntemporary work while he was unemployed. He knew he had delinquent debts but did\nnot address them. In fact, he acknowledged that instead of paying some of his\ndelinquent debt, he took out a loan for a vacation in the amount of $1,000. (Tr. 73 )\n(SOR 1.e.) He believes that the loan was in 2002 or 2003. He also admits that he just\nstopped paying on the loan despite the fact that he was working. (Tr. 76)\n\n3\nThe SOR lists six delinquent accounts totaling $20,000. The debts include auto\nloans, an overdraft, and a medical bill. The credit reports confirm these debts. (GE 4-8)\nApplicant notes that he paid some small debts that are not listed in the SOR. (AE A and\nGE 2) The total amount paid for the accounts is approximately $200.\nApplicant contacted a credit consolidation company in 2006 to help him with his\ndelinquent bills from the tax refund error and other bills. He paid them an initial fee of\n$400, but they did not help him. They advised him to stop paying any debts. (Tr. 35).\nDespite his frequent phone calls, he has not heard from them. Applicant recalls that he\ntried other consolidation companies but decided to just start paying his small debts. (Tr.\n47)\nApplicant submitted documentation showing that certain accounts were paid in\nJanuary 2011. At the hearing, he did not know whether a medical bill for $385 belonged\nto him. (SOR 1.a) After the hearing, he investigated the matter and paid the entire sum.\nApplicant submitted a receipt for SOR allegation 1.a. ($385). (AE K) Applicant also\nsubmitted a receipt for $500 showing that parking tickets from 2008 or 2009 have been\npaid recently. (AE I) The debt alleged in SOR 1.f is due to a bank overdraft. Applicant\nacknowledged that this account has been delinquent for several years. He provided\nreceipts for payment of the overdraft of $281.\nApplicant claims he has payment plans for the debts in SOR \u00b6 1.b, 1.c, 1.d., and\n1.e. He sends $25 a month. He started the repayment plans in January 2011. He did\nnot submit any structured payment plans. He testified that he will make larger payments\nas he can. (Tr. 63)\nApplicant\u2019s monthly net income is $3,300. After expenses he has approximately\n$900 in net remainder. He started a second job, but the hours vary. Since 2005,\nApplicant pays $460 a month for child support. The money is automatically deducted\nfrom his pay. Applicant has a 2007 car with a monthly car payment of $500. He has no\nnew debt and has no credit cards. His financial statement showed that he was not\npaying anything on his delinquent debts in 2009.\nAt the hearing, Applicant was sincere in his testimony that he has every intention\nof paying his delinquent debts. He realized he made some mistakes when he was\nyounger. He also admitted that he was irresponsible. He was candid and forthright in\nhis testimony. He spoke to his father about his financial situation. He is now engaged\nand told his fiancee that he is addressing his credit issues. He has taken a second job\nto help pay his debts. He has learned the importance of his credit issues. He has no\nnew debts. However, he admitted that recently he paid for his fiancee\u2019s books (about\n$400). He is also planning a wedding with a budget of $5,000. He noted that he took a\nvacation last summer. \nApplicant acknowledged that he used poor judgment with regard to his finances\nwhen he was younger. However, he did not begin addressing the debts alleged on the\nSOR until recently. He recently began a payment plan for three debts alleged in the\n\n See also ISCR Case No. 94-1075 at 3-4 (App. Bd.

He now monitors his credit reports and keeps track of his bills. He is taking his\nfinancial issues seriously due to his livelihood. (Tr. 50)\nApplicant submitted a letter of recommendation from his employer. (AE J)\nApplicant is described as a professional with sound ethics. Applicant provides critical\nsecurity for the agency. He is dedicated and trustworthy. \nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, an\nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief\nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially\ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions. These guidelines are not inflexible\nrules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, they are applied\nin conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. An administrative\njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision.\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), this process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables\nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d An administrative judge must consider all\navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and\nunfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based\non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nThe Government must present evidence to establish controverted facts alleged\nin the SOR. An applicant is responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to\nrebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by\nDepartment Counsel. . . .\u201d  The burden of proof is something less than a\n1\npreponderance of evidence.  The ultimate burden of persuasion is on the applicant.  \n2\n3\nA person seeking access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government based on trust and confidence. This relationship\ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government\nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk\nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect classified information. Such\n\n See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive\n      4\ninformation), and EO 10865 \u00a7 7.\n ISCR Case No. 93-1390 at 7-8 (App. Bd. Jan. 27, 1995).\n      5\n Id.\n      6\n5\ndecisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, rather\nthan actual, risk of compromise of classified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d  \u201cThe clearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance\n4\ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d  Any reasonable doubt\n5\nabout whether an applicant should be allowed access to sensitive information must be\nresolved in favor of protecting such information.  The decision to deny an individual a\n6\nsecurity clearance does not necessarily reflect badly on an applicant\u2019s character. It is\nmerely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President\nand the Secretary of Defense established for issuing a clearance.\nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern for Financial Considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18:\nFailure or an inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy\ndebts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-\ncontrol, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules\nand regulations, all of which can raise questions about an\nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information.\u201d It also states that \u201can individual who\nis financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in\nillegal acts to generate funds.\nApplicant currently has delinquent debts that have existed for at least five years.\nHe has known about the accounts since 2004. Consequently, Financial Considerations\nDisqualifying Condition (FC DC) AG \u00b6 19(a) (inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts)\nand FC DC AG \u00b6 19(c) (a history of not meeting financial obligations) apply. With such\nconditions raised, it is left to Applicant to overcome the case against him and mitigate\nsecurity concerns.  \nApplicant has unresolved debt for several accounts. He agrees that his debts\nhave languished over time. He has no new delinquent debt. However, he just started\nmaking the payments last month for the four accounts that are in repayment. He has a\n$500 a month car note. He is planning a wedding with a budget of $5,000.\nConsequently, Financial Considerations Mitigating Condition (FCMC) AG \u00b6 20(a) (the\n\n6\nbehavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such\ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s\ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment) does not apply.\nFinancial Considerations Mitigating Condition (FC MC) AG \u00b6 20(b) (the\nconditions that resulted in the behavior were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g.,\nloss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death,\ndivorce or separation) and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances)\ndoes not apply. Applicant has worked since high school. He was working when he\nbecame delinquent with his auto debts. He was unemployed for a brief period, but there\ndoes not seem to be a nexus for the delinquent debts. He took out a loan to take a\nvacation in 2003 or 2004. However, there is no evidence that he acted responsibly\nunder the circumstances for several years. He allowed the delinquent debts to remain\nunpaid for several years. He noted that he also took another vacation last summer. \nFC MC AG \u00b6 20(d), (the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue\ncreditors or otherwise resolve debts) does not apply in full. Applicant has made\nattempts to obtain help with his delinquent accounts. He paid small accounts in 2009\nand 2010. He is now beginning some repayment plans. However, at this time failure to\nprovide information about financial counseling obviates the applicability of FC MC AG \u00b6\n20(c) (the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and there are\nclear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control). He has a net\nremainder but has not made his delinquent debts a priority. He may be on the right\ntrack, but he has not met his burden in this case.\nWhole-Person Concept\nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of an applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2)\nthe circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency\nof the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the\ntime of the conduct; (5) the extent to which participation is\nvoluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and\nother permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for\nthe conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion,\nexploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation\nor recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a\nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. As noted above, the\nultimate burden of persuasion is on the applicant seeking a security clearance. \n\n7\nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case, as well as the whole-person factors.\nApplicant is 27 years old. When he was young, he did not manage his finances very\nwell. He allowed his delinquent debts to languish for years. He does have good\nintentions. He is a father who cares for his son through child support. He is on the right\ntrack, but at this time he has not met his burden in this case. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant a security clearance.\nClearance is denied.\n                                                     \nNOREEN A.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted all the factual allegations in the SOR, with explanations. He also provided additional information to support his request for eligibility for a security clearance. Applicant is 32 years old, married, and has two children. He works for a defense contractor in the aviation business. He served in the U.S. Army from 1996 to 1999. He had a top secret security clearance in the Army. After separating from the Army, he worked in several jobs until he obtained a degree in aviation maintenance. He used student loans to finance that education.

Murphy, Esquire, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n \n \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nHOWE, Philip S., Administrative Judge: \n \nOn August 19, 2008, Applicant submitted his Security Clearance Application (SF \n86). On April 23, 2010, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued \nApplicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under Guideline F \n(Financial Considerations). The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) effective within the Department of Defense on September \n1, 2006.  \n  \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on May 7, 2010. He answered the \nSOR in writing on May 24, 2010, and requested a hearing before an administrative \njudge. Department Counsel was prepared to proceed on June 16, 2010, and I received \nthe case assignment on the same day. DOHA issued a Notice of Hearing on June 18, \n2010, and I convened the hearing as scheduled on June 25, 2010. The Government \n \n1 \n \n \nNovember 19, 2010\n\n \n2 \n \n \noffered Exhibits 1 through 5, which were received without objection. Applicant testified \nand submitted Exhibits A and B, without objection. DOHA received the transcript of the \nhearing (Tr.) on July 7, 2010. I granted Applicant\u2019s request to keep the record open until \nAugust 3, 2010, to submit additional matters.  On August 3, 2010, he submitted Exhibit \nC, without objection. Applicant then requested permission to submit another three \nexhibits. Department Counsel had no objection, so I granted the request to submit \nExhibits D to F on August 30, 2010. The record closed on August 31, 2010. Based upon \na review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to \nclassified information is granted. \n \nProcedural and Evidentiary Rulings \n \nNotice \n \nAt the hearing, Applicant indicated he received the hearing notice on June 18, \n2010, by email, within the 15 days required under the Directive. (Tr. 11) I advised \nApplicant of his right under \u00b6 E3.1.8 of the Directive to 15-days notice before the \nhearing. Applicant affirmatively waived his right to 15 days notice. His email is marked \nas an exhibit. (Tr. 11, 12; Administrative Exhibit)  \n \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted all the factual allegations in the \nSOR, with explanations. He also provided additional information to support his request \nfor eligibility for a security clearance.   \n \n \nApplicant is 32 years old, married, and has two children. He works for a defense \ncontractor in the aviation business. He served in the U.S. Army from 1996 to 1999. He \nhad a top secret security clearance in the Army. After separating from the Army, he \nworked in several jobs until he obtained a degree in aviation maintenance. He used \nstudent loans to finance that education. Applicant admits he spent money beyond his \nability to repay it during the 2000 to 2005 period. (Tr. 20-26, 32-50; Exhibits 1-5) \n \n \nApplicant owes nine delinquent debts that are listed in the SOR. Those debts \ntotal $24,263. He also owes $26,181 on his student loans. He pays $150 monthly on his \nstudent loans and they are in good standing. He has paid the interest on the student \nloans regularly for the past three years. (Tr. 41-43, 50-59; Exhibits 2-5) \n \n \nApplicant owes $123 to a medical provider for treatment to his son (Para. 1.a). \nApplicant will pay that debt as soon as he has money to do so. This debt is not yet \nresolved. (Tr. 55, 56, 76; Exhibits 2-5) \n \n \nA telephone company has a $231 debt from 2004 that Applicant owes (Para. \n1.b). Applicant has not yet contacted that creditor. He intends to pay the debt when \nfunds are available. This debt is not yet resolved. (Tr. 56, 57; Exhibits 2-5) \n\n \n3 \n \n \n \nApplicant owes a satellite television company $655 for service when he lived in \nanother state (Para. 1.c). He had a roommate who was suppose to pay the bill but did \nnot. Applicant is attempting to obtain payment from the former roommate. Applicant has \nnot contacted the creditor to arrange payment. This debt is not yet resolved. (Tr. 57, 58; \nExhibits 2-5) \n \n \nApplicant moved from one apartment to another and the former landlord is \ncharging him an extra month\u2019s rent of $1,254 including fees in 2007 (Para. 1.d). \nApplicant contacted the creditor to dispute the amount owed five months ago They \ncould not reach an agreement, so he will work to repay the amount owed.  This debt is \nnot yet resolved. (Tr. 57, 58; Exhibits 2-5) \n \n \nA cellular telephone company seeks $496 from Applicant for service provided \nfive years ago (Para. 1.e). He will repay it, but it has not been resolved yet. (Tr. 59; \nExhibits 2-5) \n \n \nA gym membership debt dates to 2004 (Para. 1.f).  Applicant joined a gym and \nused it once. He did not cancel his membership properly and the company continued to \nbill him for his monthly fee and penalties. The debt is now $1,593. Applicant wants to \nsettle the debt for $850. No resolution has yet occurred. (Tr. 22, 59; Exhibits 2-5, F) \n \n \nIn 2005 an auto accident occurred in which Applicant suffered injuries (Para. \n1.g).  Applicant did not have medical insurance at the time. He recalls paying the $1,531 \nmedical bill but cannot find documents to prove his assertion. If he cannot find the \ndocuments, he will repay the debt again. This debt may be resolved but currently it \nshows on credit reports as due and owing. (Tr. 60; Exhibits 2-5) \n \n \nThe debt for $801 owed to a bank was settled for $250 and paid on August 31, \n2010 (Para. 1.h). This debt is resolved. (Tr. 22; Exhibits 2-5, D, E) \n \n \nThe final debt owed is to a bank on a car loan (Para. 1.i). The amount owed from \n2005 was $17,579. The vehicle was repossessed. Applicant settled this debt on July 30, \n2010, for $4,000. The creditor sent Applicant two letters as evidence the debt is \nsatisfied by payment of the settlement. This debt is resolved. (Tr. 22, 23, 50, 51; \nExhibits 2-5, B, C) \n \n \nApplicant is the sole wage earner in his family. His family\u2019s welfare and prosperity \nis important to him, hence the need to repay these debts and clear his credit record of \nthese overdue financial obligations. In addition to paying his delinquent debts, he is also \npaying his wife\u2019s credit card debts incurred before they were married. Applicant has one \ncompany credit card on which there is no balance owed. He is allowed to use that card \nwhen he travels on business. He and his wife do not have any other credit cards. \nApplicant moved to a less-expensive apartment in the past year to reduce his rent from \n$1,400 to $950. The personal financial statement in Exhibit 4 is otherwise the same now \nas July 2009 when completed. Applicant has not incurred any new debt except for his \ncar on which he made a $3,000 deposit on a $12,000 purchase price. Applicant does \n\n \n4 \n \n \nnot have any money in his checking or savings accounts on a continuing basis. \nApplicant has not received any financial counseling. (Tr. 30, 63, 70-77) \n \nApplicant\u2019s supervisor wrote a character letter on his behalf. He stated Applicant \nhas an excellent work ethic and is very professional in his daily job performance. \nApplicant knows his duties and aircraft extremely well. The supervisor recommends \nApplicant receive his security clearance. (Exhibit A)  \n     \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by an applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information.  Decisions include, by necessity, consideration \nof the possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n\n \n5 \n \n \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG & 18:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 19 contains nine disqualifying conditions that could raise \nsecurity concerns.  Two conditions are applicable to the facts in this case: \n \n(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and   \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \nApplicant accumulated $24,263 in delinquent debt from 2004 to the present time \nthat he did not begin resolving until 2009 and 2010.  Applicant has nine delinquent \ndebts listed in the SOR.  \n \nThe guideline in AG \u00b6 20 contains six conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Two conditions may be applicable:   \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \n \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur \n \nand does not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, \n \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \n \nbeyond the  person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \n \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce \n \nor separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the \n \ncircumstances; \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the \n \nproblem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is \n \nbeing resolved or is under control; \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue \n \ncreditors or otherwise resolve debts; \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy \n \nof the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and \n \nprovides documented proof to substantiate the basis of the \n \ndispute or provides evidence of actions to resolve the issue;  and, \n \n(f) the affluence resulted from a legal source of income. \n \nSeven of the debts are on-going and unpaid. The other two were unpaid until \nJuly and August 2010. Now they are settled and resolved. Therefore, the delinquencies \nare recent and not infrequent. AG \u00b6 20 (a) does not apply. \n \nAG \u00b6 20 (b) does not apply because Applicant spent more money than he could \nrepay on the earnings he made from 2000 to 2005. He knew what he was doing and \nadmitted at the hearing he spent irresponsibly.  \n  \nAG \u00b6 20 (c) does not apply because Applicant did not obtain any financial \ncounseling.   \n \nApplicant focused his efforts on starting a regular process of paying his debts. \nBased on his current progress in repaying his delinquent debts, it is likely Applicant will \nhave the remaining seven debts, currently unresolved, paid within the near future.  He \nintends to pay them. AG \u00b6 20 (d) applies because of Applicant\u2019s good-faith efforts to \nrepay his delinquent debts demonstrated by his expressed commitment and his current \nprogress in repaying the two largest debts and maintaining three years of monthly \npayments on his student loans. He may also have repaid the $1,531 medical debt from \n2005 but must find documentary proof he paid it. His frank and forthright discussion of \nhis past financial errors, coupled with his current efforts to resolve his debts, shows \nApplicant is credible in his commitment about his future repayment plans. He testified \nhis family is important to him and he wants to provide a better life for them. Applicant \nreduced his living costs substantially and is well-regarded at his work place. All these \nattributes show he will adhere to his repayment plan to resolve the delinquent debts so \nhe can maintain his employment.  \n \nApplicant sought to dispute the rent debt and the satellite television debt, but \ndecided not to do so. AG \u00b6 20 (e) does not apply because there is no ongoing or valid \ndispute in progress. \n \nFinally, there is no affluence mentioned as a source of payment. AG \u00b6 20 (f) does \nnot apply. \n\n \n7 \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of an applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 2(c) requires each case must be judged on its own merits.  Under AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance \nmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nguidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is a young man who spent \nmore than he could afford to repay while he was single. He is now married and fathered \ntwo children in the past several years.  \n \nApplicant also obtained a responsible job in the aviation business, at which he is \ntalented and enjoys. He now recognizes his financial obligations must be paid if he is to \nprovide a decent life for his family, including the future purchase of a house. He has not \nincurred new delinquent debt since 2007 when he met his wife. He does not have credit \ncards. His only debt is for his current car on which he owes less than $10,000. He is \nmaking those payments. His income is directed toward supporting his family and \nrepaying his debts as listed in the SOR. He is current on his student loan payments.  \n \nIt is obvious Applicant has a mature understanding of his financial situation and \nwhat he needs to do to resolve the past delinquencies. He has resolved over $17,000 of \ndebt through settlement agreements. The remaining seven debts total $5,760. This \namount can be paid within a relatively short time period with the continued diligence \nApplicant has applied to date in resolving the debts.  \n \nAs the Appeal Board has ruled concerning the successful mitigation of security \nconcerns arising from financial considerations., \u201c[a]n applicant is not required to show \nthat [he] has completely paid of [his] indebtedness, only that [he] has established a \nreasonable plan to resolve [his] debts and has \u2018taken significant actions to implement \n\n \n8 \n \n \n                                                          \nthat plan.\u201d1 He has established a credible track record of debt payments, showing \nresponsibility, rehabilitation, and mitigation. \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant mitigated the security concerns arising from his financial \nconsiderations. I conclude the \u201cwhole-person\u201d concept for Applicant.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a to 1.i: \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_________________ \nPHILIP S.

Applicant\u2019s admissions to the SOR allegations are admitted as fact. After a thorough review of the record, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of fact: Applicant is a 29-year-old administrative temporary contractor doing clerical work and data entry who has worked as a contractor since March 2009, and is seeking to obtain a security clearance. The director of her company states Applicant demonstrates professionalism, a strong work ethic, excellent multi-tasking skills, and has strong initiative. (Ex. I) Applicant had three charged off accounts ($324, SOR \u00b6 1.a; $109, SOR \u00b6 1.b; and $126, SOR \u00b6 1.c) with a telephone provider. The largest of these three accounts is her ex-husband\u2019s cell phone account. (Tr. 28) On September 4, 2009, she made a $118 payment, leaving a balance of $109 on the debts listed in SOR \u00b6 1.b and SOR \u00b6 1.c. (Ex. F) She is paying $50 per month on her ex-husband\u2019s account. (Ex. M, Tr. 29, 40) She was indebted ($956) on a credit card account (SOR \u00b6 1.f) placed for collection. Her ex-husband had purchased a stereo and TV. (Tr. 54) In September 2009, Applicant made a $100 payment on this debt. (Ex. C) Applicant has arranged with the creditor to pay $100 each month by automatic debit until this debt is paid. (Ex. G) Applicant owes $23,158 on her student loan (SOR \u00b6 1.d). (Ex.

After a thorough review of the record, pleadings, exhibits, and \ntestimony, I make the following findings of fact: \n \n \nApplicant is a 29-year-old administrative temporary contractor doing clerical work \nand data entry who has worked as a contractor since March 2009, and is seeking to \nobtain a security clearance. The director of her company states Applicant demonstrates \nprofessionalism, a strong work ethic, excellent multi-tasking skills, and has strong \ninitiative. (Ex. I)  \n \n \nApplicant had three charged off accounts ($324, SOR \u00b6 1.a; $109, SOR \u00b6 1.b; \nand $126, SOR \u00b6 1.c) with a telephone provider. The largest of these three accounts is \nher ex-husband\u2019s cell phone account. (Tr. 28) On September 4, 2009, she made a $118 \npayment, leaving a balance of $109 on the debts listed in SOR \u00b6 1.b and SOR \u00b6 1.c. \n(Ex. F) She is paying $50 per month on her ex-husband\u2019s account. (Ex. M, Tr. 29, 40) \nShe was indebted ($956) on a credit card account (SOR \u00b6 1.f) placed for collection. Her \nex-husband had purchased a stereo and TV. (Tr. 54) In September 2009, Applicant \nmade a $100 payment on this debt. (Ex. C) Applicant has arranged with the creditor to \npay $100 each month by automatic debit until this debt is paid. (Ex. G) Applicant owes \n$23,158 on her student loan (SOR \u00b6 1.d). (Ex. G) She is making $165 per month \npayments on this debt. (Ex. C, Tr. 46)  \n \n \nReview Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) \npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for \nSORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n\n \n3 \n \n \n \nIn May 2007, Applicant and her then husband separated. (Tr. 26) They had \nmarried in September 2006. Applicant has a three-year old daughter. The divorce \ndecree (Ex. A) states there were no children of the marriage. Following the separation, \nher husband made a few payments to Applicant before ceasing all payments. In May \n2009, their divorce was final and Applicant remarried. The divorce decree did not \ninclude a property settlement or any child support obligation. Her current husband \nreceives $334 disability each month. (Ex. H, Tr. 72)    \n \n  \nIn August 2007, Applicant lost her $60,000 a year job as an account executive at \na mortgage company. (Tr. 26, 89, 102) She had been with the company since June \n2003. (Ex. B) She remained unemployed for a year, collecting unemployment \ncompensation of $263 per week. (Tr. 90, 91) In order to limit her expenses, Applicant \nmoved in with her mother. In October 2007, her car was repossessed. (Tr. 95) She had \npurchased the car for $17,564 with monthly payments of $293. Following repossession, \nthe vehicle was sold with $7,183 remaining on the original obligation. In August 2009, \nthe creditor offered to settle the debt for $4,500. (Ex. N)  \n \n \nIn March 2009, Applicant began working for a temporary employment agency. \nShe is paid $14 per hour. (Ex. H) With her limited income, Applicant intends to pay three \nof the debts first and then address the remainder. (Tr. 63) She intends to pay all her \nobligations. She intends to save up to make a lump sum payment on the car debt. \nApplicant has sought counseling from her mother-in-law who is an accountant. (Tr. 85)  \n \n \nA summary of Applicant\u2019s debts and their current status follows: \n \n \n \nCreditor \nAmount Current Status \na Telephone provider. \n$324 \nThis is her ex-husband\u2019s phone bill on \nwhich she pays $50 monthly. \n \nb \nTelephone provider. \n \n \n$109 \n \nPaying.

She has \nstarted her payments. \ne Repossessed vehicle. \n \n$7,183 \n \nThe creditor has agreed to settle this \nmatter for $4,500. \n \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \n \nCreditor \nAmount \nCurrent Status \n f \nCredit card collection \naccount. \n$956 \nApplicant has arranged to pay $100 per \nmonth by automatic debit on this debt. \nPayment has commenced. \n \nTotal debt listed in SOR \n$31,856 \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which must be considered \nin evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \n\n \n5 \n \n \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to \npotential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \n \nRevised Adjudicative Guideline (AG) \u00b6 18 articulates the security concerns \nrelating to financial problems: \n \nFailure or inability to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds. \n \nAdditionally, an individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, negligent, or careless in properly handling and \nsafeguarding classified information. Behaving responsibly or irresponsibly in one aspect \nof life provides an indication of how a person may behave in other aspects of life.  \n \nA person\u2019s relationship with her creditors is a private matter until evidence is \nuncovered demonstrating an inability or unwillingness to repay debts under agreed \nupon terms. Absent evidence of strong extenuating or mitigating circumstances, an \napplicant with a history of serious or recurring financial difficulties is in a position of risk \nthat is inconsistent with holding a security clearance. An applicant is not required to be \ndebt free, but is required to manage her finances so as to meet her financial obligations. \n \n \nThe record evidence supports a conclusion Applicant has a history of financial \nproblems. Applicant had six charged off accounts or accounts placed for collection, \nwhich totaled in excess of $31,000. Applicant admits the debts. Disqualifying Conditions \nAG \u00b6 19(a), \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts\u201d and AG \u00b6 19(c), \u201ca history of not \nmeeting financial obligations,\u201d apply.  \n \n \nFive financial considerations mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable: \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control; \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \nApplicant had a good job as an account executive at a mortgage company \npaying $60,000 per year. She was unemployed for a year collecting $263 per week \nunemployment compensation. Her car was repossessed. She now works for a \ntemporary employment agency making $14 per hour. With her limited income she has \nbegun to repay her debts.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s conduct does not warrant full application of AG \u00b6 20(a) because she \ndid not resolve all of her delinquent SOR debts through payment, established payment \nplans or disputes. Her delinquent debts are \u201ca continuing course of conduct\u201d under the \nAppeal Board\u2019s jurisprudence. See ISCR Case No. 07-11814 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 29, \n2008) (citing ISCR Case No. 01-03695 (App. Bd. Oct. 16, 2002)).  \n \nAG & 20(b) applies. Applicant experienced both separation and divorce along \nwith the financial burden associated with each. Additionally, she lost her job in the \nmortgage industry and was unemployed for a year causing an adverse financial impact. \nThese are factors beyond her control. She acted reasonably to limit her financial \nproblems by moving in with her mother to save expenses.  \n \nThe Appeal Board\u2019s discussion of AG \u00b6 20(b) in ISCR Case No. 08-06567 (App. \nBd. Oct. 29, 2009) clarifies the applicability of this mitigating condition when an \nApplicant is unable to make substantial progress on delinquent debts after \ncircumstances outside an applicant\u2019s control cause delinquent debt. In ISCR Case No. \n08-06567 (A.J. July 27, 2009), the applicant had obtained financial counseling, \n\n \n7 \n \n \n                                                          \ndeveloped a repayment plan, and took reasonable actions to effectuate his repayment \nplan. Id. at 3. The Appeal Board found: \n \n. . . an applicant is not required to be debt-free nor to develop a plan for \npaying off all debts immediately or simultaneously. All that is required is \nthat an applicant act responsibly given his circumstances and develop a \nreasonable plan for repayment, accompanied by \u201cconcomitant conduct,\u201d \nthat is, actions which evidence a serious intent to effectuate the plan. See \nISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008). \n \nOnce Applicant returned to full-time employment in March 2009, she worked to \npay her creditors.2 For example, she paid her student loan and the telecommunications \ndebts. She has not made any payments to the creditor in SOR \u00b6 1.e, but is saving in \norder to be able to accept the creditor\u2019s offer and make a lump sum payment. She has \ncontacted all of her SOR creditors and knows what she must do to resolve her debts. \nApplicant has acted responsibly under the circumstances. There are clear indications \nthat her financial problem is being resolved or is under control. She has established her \nfinancial responsibility.  \n \nApplicant has received financial advice and counseling from her mother-in-law, \nan accountant. AG & 20(c) applies. She has reached agreement and started making \npayments on all but the repossession debt.  \n \nThe loss of her $60,000 a year job was not only an unexpected event, but an \nevent which under such circumstances is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on \nApplicant\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. She was not living \nbeyond her means. The debts were three phone accounts, her student loan, a vehicle \nrepossession, and less than $1,000 owed on a credit card. She has initiated a good- \ngood faith3 to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. AG & 20(d) partially \napplies. \n \n2\u201cEven if Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances outside \nhis [or her] control, the Judge could still consider whether Applicant has since acted in a reasonable \nmanner when dealing with those financial difficulties.\u201d ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. Bd. Jan. \n12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 at 4 \n(App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). A component is \nwhether the Applicant maintained contact with his or her creditors and attempted to negotiate partial \npayments to keep debts current. \n \n3The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a \u201cgood faith\u201d effort to repay overdue \ncreditors or otherwise resolve debts: \n \nIn order to qualify for application of [the \u201cgood faith\u201d mitigating condition], an applicant \nmust present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \nsome other good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant\u2019s debts. The Directive does \nnot define the term \u2018good-faith.\u2019 However, the Board has indicated that the concept of \ngood-faith \u2018requires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, \nprudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.\u2019 Accordingly, an applicant must \n\n \n8 \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                          \nThe creditor has offered to settle the car debt for $4,500. With her limited amount \nof available income, Applicant has chosen to address her other debts first. She intends \nto save money to allow her to make a lump-sum payment on this debt. This sole \nremaining debt does not raise concern about her current reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment.  \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.  \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is paying the majority of \nher debts. She is saving money to accept an offer on the remaining obligation. Her \ndebts cannot be a source of improper pressure or duress. Of course, the issue is not \nsimply whether all her debts are paid or are being paid\u2014it is whether her financial \ncircumstances raise concerns about her fitness to hold a security clearance. (See AG & \n2(a)(1).)  \n \nThe Appeal Board has addressed a key element in the whole person analysis in \nfinancial cases stating: \n \n \ndo more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally available option (such as \nbankruptcy [or statute of limitations]) in order to claim the benefit of [the \u201cgood faith\u201d \nmitigating condition]. \n \n(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2004) (quoting \nISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 4, 2001)). \n \n\n \n9 \n \n \nIn evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the \nconcept of \u201c\u2018meaningful track record\u2019 necessarily includes evidence of \nactual debt reduction through payment of debts.\u201d However, an applicant is \nnot required, as a matter of law, to establish that he has paid off each and \nevery debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an applicant \ndemonstrate that he has \u2018 . . . established a plan to resolve his financial \nproblems and taken significant actions to implement that plan.\u2019 The Judge \ncan reasonably consider the entirety of an applicant\u2019s financial situation \nand his actions in evaluating the extent to which that applicant\u2019s plan for \nthe reduction of his outstanding indebtedness is credible and realistic. See \nDirective \u00b6 E2.2(a) (\u2018Available, reliable information about the person, past \nand present, favorable and unfavorable, should be considered in reaching \na determination.\u2019) There is no requirement that a plan provide for \npayments on all outstanding debts simultaneously. Rather, a reasonable \nplan (and concomitant conduct) may provide for the payment of such \ndebts one at a time. Likewise, there is no requirement that the first debts \nactually paid in furtherance of a reasonable debt plan be the ones listed in \nthe SOR. \n \nISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008) (internal citations omitted).  \n \nThe debts incurred were not the type that indicates poor self-control, lack of \njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations. Money was not spent \nfrivolously. The debts were incurred when she had a $60,000 job. Viewed in that \ncontext, her debts are not unreasonable obligations. She owed a $1,000 credit card \ndebt and less than $500 for telephone services. The largest of her debts was not \nincurred on luxuries, but was her student loan. The repossession of her car would not \nhave occurred absent the loss of her job.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant mitigated the security concerns arising from her financial \nconsiderations.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations:  FOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1. f:  \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \n\n \n10 \n \n \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.  \n \n \n_____________________ \nCLAUDE R. HEINY II \nAdministrative Judge \n \n",

He was born in Russia, immigrated to the United States, and became a naturalized citizen in August 2007. He married in 1979 and his wife is a citizen of Russia and a registered alien in the United States. They have one child born in Russia in 1980, who became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 2004. Applicant earned a bachelor\u2019s degree, master\u2019s degree, and PhD in Russia.1 Applicant holds a Russian passport that he obtained in June 2007, and which expires in June 2012. He used the Russian passport for entry into that country after he became a U.S. citizen. During his interview with the investigator from the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) in October 2008, he stated he would renounce his citizenship with Russia and surrender his Russian passport if it were a condition of his employment.2 On April 1, 2009, in response to interrogatories that asked whether he was willing to destroy, surrender, or invalidate his Russian passport he stated: This is not allowed by Russian law and may be penalized and will draw unnecessary attention to my activities.

Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance is denied. \n \nOn August 6, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued \nto Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under Guideline \nB, Foreign Influence, and Guideline C, Foreign Preference. The action was taken under \nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February \n20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \n(Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines effective within the Department of Defense \nfor SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n \n \nIn an undated answer to the SOR, Applicant elected to have his case decided on \nthe written record. On October 20, 2009, Department Counsel submitted the \n \n1 \n \n \nApril 7, 2010\n\n \n2 \n \n \n                                                          \nGovernment\u2019s File of Relevant Material (FORM). The FORM was mailed to Applicant \nand it was received on October 28, 2009. Applicant was afforded an opportunity to file \nobjections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation. Applicant did not \nprovide additional information. The case was assigned to me on March 3, 2010.  \n \nProcedural Rulings \n \nRequest for Administrative Notice \n \n \nDepartment Counsel submitted a formal request, included in the FORM, that I \ntake administrative notice of certain facts relating to Russia. Applicant did not object and \nthe request is approved. The source documents were included as part of the FORM and \nare included in the record. They are Hearing Exhibits. The facts administratively noticed \nare set out in the Findings of Fact, below.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR he admitted all of the allegations. After a \nthorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the \nfollowing findings of fact. \n \n \nApplicant is 53 years old and is employed by a defense contractor. He was born \nin Russia, immigrated to the United States, and became a naturalized citizen in August \n2007. He married in 1979 and his wife is a citizen of Russia and a registered alien in the \nUnited States. They have one child born in Russia in 1980, who became a naturalized \nU.S. citizen in 2004. Applicant earned a bachelor\u2019s degree, master\u2019s degree, and PhD in \nRussia.1  \n \n \nApplicant holds a Russian passport that he obtained in June 2007, and which \nexpires in June 2012. He used the Russian passport for entry into that country after he \nbecame a U.S. citizen. During his interview with the investigator from the Office of \nPersonnel Management (OPM) in October 2008, he stated he would renounce his \ncitizenship with Russia and surrender his Russian passport if it were a condition of his \nemployment.2 On April 1, 2009, in response to interrogatories that asked whether he \nwas willing to destroy, surrender, or invalidate his Russian passport he stated:   \n \nThis is not allowed by Russian law and may be penalized and will draw \nunnecessary attention to my activities. (1) I need passport for occasional \ntravel to Russia (e.g. family emergency). (2) Russian Federation requires \ncertain procedure for passport return.3  \n \n1 The FORM did not include the date when Applicant moved to the United States. However, Applicant \nlisted on his SF 86 a place of residence in the United States in 1998.  Item 4. \n \n2 Item 5. \n \n3 Id. \n\n \n3 \n \n \n                                                          \nApplicant intends to use his Russian passport in the future, and is not willing to destroy, \nsurrender, or invalidate it. Applicant continues to exercise dual citizenship with Russia \nand feels compelled to follow Russian laws that pertain to its citizens. \n \n \nApplicant owns an apartment in Russia valued at approximately $100,000. He \nhas owned the apartment since 1983 and intends on maintaining ownership for at least \nfive to ten years. He estimated his net assets in the United States to be approximately \n$270,000. Applicant admitted on his answer to the SOR that he maintains his Russian \ncitizenship to protect his financial interest.4 \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s sister and mother-in-law are citizens and residents of Russian. His \nsister works in a bank. He is close to his sister and contacts her monthly. His mother-in-\nlaw is elderly and bedridden. She was a music teacher. Applicant has contact with her \nmonthly when his wife calls her on the telephone.5  \n \n \nApplicant maintains contact with a college friend who is a citizen and resident of \nRussia. He contacts him about every three months by telephone. His friend works in the \nfood distribution industry.6  \n \n \nApplicant traveled to Russia in 2002, 2003, 2004, 2006 to 2007, and 2008 to \n2009. Some of the trips were to attend funerals for family members, others were for \npleasure.  \n \nRussia \n \n \nRussia is a federation composed of 12 republics. Its population of 142 million \npeople is multinational and multi-ethnic. Russia achieved independence with the \ndissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991. The Government has an increasingly \ncentralized political system, with power concentrated in the president and prime \nminister, a weak multiparty political system, and a ruling party dominated by a bicameral \nlegislature. Russia is a nuclear superpower that, since the dissolution of the Soviet \nUnion, continues to develop politically, socially, and economically.  \n \n \nSince 2003, U.S.-Russian relations have been strained due to tensions on a \nnumber of issues. These include an incident in which Russia sent its army across an \ninternationally recognized boundary to attempt to change, by force, the borders of \nGeorgia, a country with a democratically-elected government. Russia also issued \nthreats against Poland, including the threat of nuclear attack. There have been \nsuspicious poisonings and killings of journalists and those deemed \u201cundesirable,\u201d and \n \n4 Answer to SOR. In his interview with the OPM investigator, Applicant disclosed he did not have any \nfinancial connections or interests in Russia. He later provided information about his financial interests \nwhen he completed the interrogatories. Item 5. \n \n5 Id. \n \n6 Id. \n\n \n4 \n \n \nthe creation in the state-controlled Russian media of an \u201cenemy image\u201d of the United \nStates.  \n \n \nRussia has an active, recent, and ongoing collection program targeting the \nUnited States for sensitive and protected U.S. technology. Russia and China have been \nthe most aggressive collectors and accounted for the majority of such targeting. \nRussia\u2019s lead in the targeting of U.S. technologies, through its industrial espionage \nefforts dates back to at least 1997. Russian espionage specializes in military technology \nand gas and oil industry technical expertise.  \n \n \nRussia actively provides various technologies to other countries, including Iran, \nSyria, and Venezuela, contrary to U.S. concerns. It also has provided missile \ntechnology to China, Iran, Syria, and Venezuela. Russia has refused to cease \nconstructing nuclear reactors in Iran, despite U.S. concerns and economic sanctions.  \n \n \nRussia\u2019s internal problems include recent acts of terrorism. The U.S. Department \nof State has warned U.S. citizens about dangers in travel to parts of Russia. The \nChechen conflict has led to human rights abuses as security forces engage in killings, \ntorture, abuse, violence, and other brutal or humiliating treatment, often with impunity. \nOverall, Russia\u2019s human rights record remains uneven and poor in some areas. Specific \ninstances of human rights abuses, as reported by the U.S. Department of State, include: \nreports that the government or its agents committed politically motivated killings, and \nother arbitrary killings, credible reports that law enforcement engaged in torture, abuse, \nand violence, extremely harsh and life threatening prison conditions, and arbitrary arrest \nand detention.  \n \n \nAn example of the Russian government\u2019s restrictions on freedom of movement \nwithin the country is that all adults must carry a government-issued internal passport \nwhile traveling within the country. They are also required to register with the local \nauthorities within a specified time of their arrival at a new location. \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \n\n \n5 \n \n \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \nAG \u00b6 6 expresses the security concern regarding foreign influence:  \nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual \nhas divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by \nany foreign interest. Adjudication under this Guideline can and should \nconsider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or \nfinancial interest is located, including, but not limited to, such \nconsiderations as whether the foreign country is known to target United \nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a \nrisk of terrorism. \n\n \n6 \n \n \nAG \u00b6 7 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. I have considered all of them and especially considered the following:  \n \n(a) contact with a foreign family member, business or professional \nassociate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a \nforeign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign \nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion;  \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to \nprotect sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s desire to \nhelp a foreign person, group, or country by providing that information;  \n \n(d) sharing living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of \ncitizenship status, if that relationship creates a heightened risk of foreign \ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and \n \n(e) a substantial business, financial, or property interest in a foreign \ncountry, or in any foreign-owned or foreign operated business, which \ncould subject the individual to heightened risk of foreign influence or \nexploitation.  \n \nThe mere possession of close family ties with a person in a foreign country is not, \nas a matter of law, disqualifying under Guideline B. However, if only one relative lives in \na foreign country and an applicant has contact with that relative, this factor alone is \nsufficient to create the potential for foreign influence and could potentially result in the \ncompromise of classified information.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s wife is a citizen of Russia and is a resident alien of the United States. \nHis sister, mother-in-law, and close friend are all citizens and residents of Russia. He \ntravels regularly to Russia for family visits. No information was provided as to how often \nhis wife travels to Russia. His sister is a teacher. His mother-in-law no longer works and \nis bedridden. No information was provided about whether she receives a pension or \nsubsistence from the government. Applicant has regular contact with his relatives and \nfriend. These relationships and contacts create a heightened risk of foreign pressure, or \nattempted exploitation, given the nature of Russia\u2019s aggressive collection program \nthrough industrial espionage, and targeting the United States sensitive technology. They \nalso create a conflict of interest because his relationships are sufficiently close to raise a \nsecurity concern. Therefore, I find disqualifying conditions AG \u00b6 7(a) and (b) apply. \n \nI find disqualifying condition AG \u00b6 7(d) applies to Applicant\u2019s wife. It appears she \nhas lived with him in the United States since they immigrated. He became a naturalized \nU.S. citizen, she did not. Applicant\u2019s relationship with his wife creates a potential conflict \nof interest between his obligation to protect sensitive information or technology and his \nobvious loyalty and desire to help his wife, if the situation should arise. Applicant has a \nsubstantial financial interest in Russia. He intends on maintaining his interests in \n\n \n7 \n \n \nRussia, which is approximately one-third of his totally wealth. Based on Applicant\u2019s \nsubstantial financial interests, Russia\u2019s human rights abuses, and its active industrial \nespionage record there is a heightened risk of foreign influence and exploitation. \nTherefore, disqualifying condition AG \u00b6 7(e) applies \n \nI have also analyzed all of the facts and considered all of the mitigating conditions \nfor this security concern under AG \u00b6 8 and especially considered the following: \n \n(a) the nature of the relationship with foreign persons, the country in which \nthese persons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in \nthat country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a \nposition of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, \ngroup, organization and interests of the U.S.;  \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country is \nso minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships \nand loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any \nconflict of interests in favor of the U.S. interests;  \n \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation; and \n \n(f) the value or routine nature of the foreign business, financial, or property \ninterests is such that they are unlikely to result in a conflict and could not \nbe used effectively to influence, manipulate, or pressure the individual.  \n \nIn the past, Applicant has traveled to Russia for family matters and maintains a \nRussian passport so he can travel for emergencies in the future. He visits his relatives \nwhen in Russia. He maintains regular contact with them and his friend. His wife is a \ncitizen of Russia and presumably travels there too. These close personal relationships \nare a concern, as is Russia. Considering the Russian government\u2019s human rights \npractices, its aggressive espionage activities, and its political stance toward the United \nStates, it is likely that Applicant could be placed in a position of having to choose \nbetween the interests of his family and the interests of the U.S. I find mitigating \ncondition AG \u00b6 8(a) does not apply. Equally troubling is that Applicant maintains dual \ncitizenship with Russia and his wife maintains her Russian citizenship. Those facts \ncreate a conflict of interest. Applicant has not provided sufficient evidence to conclude \nthat his sense of loyalty to his wife and family in Russia is so minimal that any conflict \nwould be resolved in favor of the United States. I find mitigating condition AG \u00b6 8(b) \ndoes not apply. Applicant\u2019s contact and communication with his wife, relatives, and \nfriend are not causal or infrequent, as he has frequent contact with them. His \nrelationships could create a risk for foreign influence and exploitation. I find mitigating \ncondition AG \u00b6 8(c) does not apply. Applicant has a substantial financial interest in \nRussia. He maintains his dual citizenship in order to protect that financial interest. \n\n \n8 \n \n \nBased on the value of Applicant\u2019s financial interest in Russian and his net worth in the \nU.S., I conclude it could create a conflict and be used to influence, manipulate, or \npressure Applicant. I find mitigating condition AG \u00b6 8(f) does not apply.  \n \nGuideline C, Foreign Preference \nAG \u00b6 9 expresses the security concern regarding foreign preference:  \nWhen an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a \nforeign country over the United States, then he or she may be prone to \nprovide information or make decisions that are harmful to the interests of \nthe United States. \nAG \u00b6 10 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. I have specifically considered the following: \n(a) exercise of any right, privilege or obligation of foreign citizenship after \nbecoming a U.S. citizen or through the foreign citizenship of a family \nmember. This includes but is not limited to: (1) possession of a current \nforeign passport .  .  .   (5) using foreign citizenship to protect financial or \nbusiness interests in another country. \nApplicant holds a valid Russian passport. He has used the passport to gain entry \ninto Russia after he became a U.S. citizen. He maintains his Russian citizenship to \nprotect his financial interests in Russia. I find disqualifying condition AG \u00b6 10(a) (1) and \n(5) applies. \nI have considered all the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 11. Specifically I have \nconsidered the following:  \n(a) dual citizenship is based solely on parents\u2019 citizenship or birth in a \nforeign country;  \n(b) the individual has expressed a willingness to renounce dual citizenship;  \n(c) exercise of the rights, privileges, or obligations of foreign citizenship \noccurred before the individual became a U.S. citizen or when the \nindividual was a minor; and  \n(e) the passport has been destroyed, surrendered to the cognizant security \nauthority, or otherwise invalidated.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s dual citizenship is not based solely on his birth in a foreign country. \nHe was born in Russia and exercised his Russian citizenship after he became a U.S. \ncitizen by maintaining and using his Russian passport. I find AG \u00b6 11(a) does not apply. \nApplicant has not categorically expressed a willingness to renounce his Russian \n\n \n9 \n \n \ncitizenship. He made a statement to the OPM investigator that he would renounce it if \nhis job required it. I find mitigating AG \u00b6 11(b) does not apply. Applicant was provided \nan opportunity to destroy or surrender his Russian passport. He chose not to do so \nbecause he intends to use it to travel to Russia in the future and maintain his financial \ninterests there. I find mitigating conditions AG \u00b6 11(b), (c), and (e) do not apply.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n  \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is a dual citizen of Russia. \nHe maintains a Russian passport that he has used to travel there after he became a \nU.S. citizen. He intends to retain his Russian passport to protect financial interests and \nvisit family there. His wife is a Russian citizen, who resides in the United States. He \nmaintains close personal contact with his sister, mother-in-law, and friend.  \n \nThe nature of a nation\u2019s government, its relationship with the United States, and \nits human rights record are relevant in assessing the likelihood that an applicant\u2019s family \nmembers are vulnerable to government coercion. The risk of coercion, persuasion, or \nduress is significantly greater if the foreign country has an authoritarian government, a \nfamily member is associated with or dependent upon the foreign government, or the \ncountry is known to conduct intelligence operations against the United States. Russia \nconducts intelligence operations against the United States. There is derogatory \nevidence regarding Russia\u2019s human rights record and the Government\u2019s actions against \nits citizens. This places the burden of persuasion on Applicant to demonstrate that his \ncontacts in Russia do not pose a security risk, and he is not in a position to be forced to \nchoose between loyalty to the United States and his family members. With its negative \nhuman rights record and its Government\u2019s willingness to use force and violence against \n\n \n10 \n \n \nits citizens, it is conceivable that Applicant\u2019s family members could be vulnerable to \ncoercion.  \n \nOverall the record evidence leaves me with serious questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns arising under the Guideline \nB, Foreign Influence, and Guideline C, Foreign Preference.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.e: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline C:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph   1.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant  \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nCarol G.

He intends to spend time in\nEstonia when he retires, although he does not intend to live there because the medical care is not as\ngood as in the U.S.  His connection to Estonia is based on heritage and culture.\nEstonia has been a parliamentary democracy since 1992.  It is a member of NATO and of\nthe European Union.  It has a stable and constructive relationship with the U.S.\nDiscussion\nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility, there is a strong\npresumption against the grant or maintenance of a security clearance.  See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913\nF. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991).  After the Government presents\nevidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut or mitigate those\nconcerns.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  In rendering a final decision, an \u201cagency must examine the\nrelevant data and articulate a satisfactory explanation for\u201d the decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational\nconnection between the facts found and the choice made.\u2019\u201d Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n of the United\nStates v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983)(quoting Burlington Truck Lines,\nInc. v. United States, 371 U.S. 156, 168 (1962)).  The standard applicable in security clearance\ndecisions \u201cis that a clearance may be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests of the\nnational security.\u2019\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  \u201cAny doubt\nconcerning personnel being considered for access to classified information will be resolved in favor\nof the national security.\u201d  Directive, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 2(b). \nThe Judge concluded that Applicant\u2019s circumstances raised security concerns under both\nGuidelines alleged in the SOR.  However, the Judge concluded that multiple mitigating conditions\nunder the Foreign Influence and Foreign Preference Guidelines apply in Applicant\u2019s case.  Similarly,\nthe Judge\u2019s whole-person analysis concluded in Applicant\u2019s favor.\nDepartment Counsel argues that the Judge\u2019s favorable conclusions regarding mitigation were\nnot supported by the record.  Specifically, Department Counsel cited (1) the Judge\u2019s application of\nMitigating Condition (MC) 8(a) based on minimal differences between the U.S. and Estonia; (2) the\nJudge\u2019s mitigation of Guideline 7(e) without use of 8(f); and (3) the Judge\u2019s conclusions as to\nmitigation under Foreign Preference even though the plain language of the mitigating conditions\ndoes not apply to Applicant\u2019s conduct and circumstances.  \n\n1See Directive, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 8(a): \u201cthe nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which\nthese persons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in that country are such that it is unlikely the\nindividual will be placed in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, group,\norganization, or government and the interests of the U.S[.]\u201d\n2Directive, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 8(b): \u201cthere is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of loyalty\nor obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country is so minimal or the individual has such deep and\nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest\nin favor of the U.S. interest[.]\u201d  \n3Directive, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 8(c): \u201ccontact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and infrequent that\nthere is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign influence or exploitation[.]\u201d  \n4Directive, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 11(e): \u201cthe passport has been destroyed, surrendered to the cognizant security\nauthority, or otherwise invalidated[.]\u201d \n \n4\nDepartment Counsel\u2019s arguments are persuasive, given the totality of the record evidence.\nThe Judge stated, in the Guideline B analysis, that differences between the interests of the U.S. and\nEstonia are \u201cminimal\u201d and that there is little likelihood that Applicant will be placed in a position\nto have to choose between the interests of the two countries.1  In the first place, the Judge\u2019s\nconclusion about the purportedly minimal differences between U.S. and Estonian policy are\nspeculative at best.  More to the point, the \u201cnational security of the United States can be at risk\nwhether a person with foreign family ties is vulnerable to coercion or blackmail, or is vulnerable to\nnon-coercive influence,\u201d as might be the case of an applicant with relatives living in a country that\nis a U.S. ally.  ISCR Case No. 02-02892 at 10 (App. Bd. Jun. 28, 2004).  Given the extent of\nApplicant\u2019s family and other personal contacts in Estonia, the Judge\u2019s decision does not explain, and\nthe record evidence does not support, his conclusion that Applicant is not likely to have to choose\nbetween the interests of those persons and the interests of the U.S.   \nThe Judge favorably applied two other Guideline B mitigating conditions, 8(b)2 and 8(c).3\nFor similar reasons as those stated above, the record viewed as a whole does not support a\nconclusion that Applicant met his burden of persuasion that his ties to his friends and relatives in\nEstonia, including government officials, are such that he can be expected to resolve any conflict of\ninterest in favor of the U.S.  Especially of concern are his ties with his daughter there.  \nRegarding Guideline C, the Judge noted that Applicant had surrendered his passport.4\nHowever, many of his conclusions are without foundation in the record.  For example, it is not clear\nwhy Applicant\u2019s evidence that he exercised Estonian citizenship rights for business and economic\nreasons (Decision at 10), even if true, mitigates the security concerns arising therefrom.  There is\na paucity of record evidence to demonstrate that he will have no further economic interests in\nEstonia.  Also, the Judge accepted Applicant\u2019s statement that he voted in Estonian elections simply\nto advance U.S. interests.  He does not explain why he finds that statement to be mitigating.\n\n5\nIn light of the foregoing, the Judge\u2019s decision fails to consider important aspects of the case\nand runs counter to the weight of the record evidence.  ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-3 (App. Bd.\nJun. 2, 2006).  Viewed in light of the record as a whole, the Judge\u2019s decision is not sustainable,\neither under the mitigating conditions or the whole-person factors. \nOrder\nThe Judge\u2019s favorable security clearance decision is REVERSED.  \n     \nSigned: Michael Y.

O'Neil, Esquire, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \nCREAN, THOMAS M., Administrative Judge: \n \n \nBased on a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility \nfor access to classified information is granted. Applicant mitigated security concerns for \nforeign preference and foreign influence. \n \nApplicant submitted an electronic Questionnaire for Investigative Processing (e-\nQIP) on October 24, 2007, for his employment with a defense contractor. On June 7, \n2010, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued to Applicant a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns for foreign influence under \nGuideline B, and foreign preference under Guideline C. The action was taken under \nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February \n20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \n(Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) effective in the Department of Defense \non September 1, 2006. He acknowledged receipt of the SOR on June 11, 2010. \n \n \nApplicant timely answered the SOR. He admitted all of the factual allegations \nunder both Guideline B and Guideline C. Applicant requested a hearing before an \nadministrative judge. Department Counsel was prepared to proceed on August 12, \n2010. The case was assigned to me on September 8, 2010. Department Counsel was \n1 \n \nJanuary 14, 2011\n\n2 \n \nalso prepared to proceed on a companion case concerning the same security concerns \ninvolving Applicant's wife. Since the facts and circumstances were almost exactly the \nsame in both cases, a joint hearing, with the concurrence of Department Counsel and \nboth Applicants, was held. DOHA issued a Notice of Hearing on September 15, 2010, \nfor a hearing on October 7, 2010. I convened the hearing as scheduled. The \nGovernment offered five exhibits, marked and received into the record without objection \nas Government Exhibits (Gov. Ex.) 1 through 5. Applicant and two witnesses testified on \nhis behalf. Applicants offered a combined 25 exhibits marked and admitted in to the \nrecord as Applicant Exhibits A through Y. Most of the exhibits pertained to both \nApplicants. Any exhibits that pertain solely to one of the Applicants will be clearly \nidentified in this decision. The record was held open for Applicant to submit additional \ndocuments. Applicant timely submitted one additional document admitted as App. Ex. Z. \nThe Government had no objections to the document. (Gov. Ex. 6, Memorandum, dated \nDecember 10, 2010). DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) of the hearing on October 18, \n2010.  \n \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nAfter a thorough review of the pleadings, transcript, and exhibits, I make the \nfollowing essential findings of fact. Applicant admitted all of the factual allegations raised \nin the SOR.  \n \n \nApplicant is 64 years old, and has been a principal information systems engineer \nfor a defense contractor for over three years. He has a bachelor's degree in electrical \nengineering, a master's degree in computer science, and has completed other post-\ngraduate courses. He has been married for over 35 years and has three grown children \nall born in the United States. Applicant and his wife reside in the United States. His wife \nis a dual citizen of the United States and Estonia born in the United States of Estonian \nparents who also immigrated to the United States through a refugee camp. She grew up \nin an Estonian household and speaks fluent Estonian. She is a freelance translator of \nEstonian and English and has received translation projects from the United States \ngovernment, Estonian government, and private sources. They frequently attend social \nevents at the Estonian embassy. One daughter works for an Estonian government \nagency as a translator and lives and resides in Estonia. Applicant and his wife talk to \nher frequently and see her when they visit Estonia. The other daughter is a doctoral \nstudent at a United States university. Their son recently left active duty with the Marine \nCorps after serving two tours in Iraq and resides in the United States. Applicant and his \nwife speak Estonian at home, and his entire family is fluent in Estonian. (Tr. 21-25, 45-\n50, 56-57; Gov. Ex. 3, e-QIP, dated October 24, 2007; App. Ex. L, Certificate, dated \nFebruary 22, 2008). Applicant provided a detailed affidavit concerning his life story, \nconnections to Estonia, and responses to security issues raised in the SOR. (Gov. Ex. \n5, Affidavit, dated July 11, 2008) \n \n \nApplicant's parents were originally from Estonia. They fled Estonia during World \nWar II when Estonia was occupied for a second time by the Soviet Union. They went to \na refugee camp in Germany where Applicant was born in 1946. Three years later in \n\n3 \n \nNovember 1949, the family came to the United States and finally settled a year later in \npermanent location. Applicant grew up in a normal United States community. His father \nwas a mechanic at a local plant and his mother was a housewife. He lived in a typical \nUnited States community, playing with friends and attending and graduating from the \nlocal schools. He started school not speaking English since it was not spoken at home. \nHe quickly learned English and assisted his parents learning the language so they could \nbecome United States citizens in 1956. He became a citizen in 1960 at the age of 14. \n(Tr. 28-33; App. Ex. A, Citizen certificate, dated May 10, 1984)  \n \n \nApplicant attended a state university matriculating in electrical engineering as \nwell as being a member of the Air Force Reserve Officer's Training Corps (ROTC). His \nparents were refugees from communism and he felt the way to fight back was to join the \narmed forces. His grades and participation in the program was sufficient for him to be \nselected for, and receive, an Air Force scholarship to pay for part of his education. He \nreceived his bachelor's degree in electrical engineering, was selected as a distinguished \nmilitary graduate, and commissioned in the Air Force in 1968. (App. Ex. B, Transcript, \ndated June 10, 1968; App. Ex. D, Appointment Order, dated June 5, 1968) He applied \nfor and received an educational deferment to pursue a master's degree. He received a \nmaster's degree in computer science in August 1970. (App. Ex. C, Transcript, dated \nAugust 20, 1970) He entered Air Force active duty, and served two years as a computer \nprogrammer supporting the air defense system. He had a secret security clearance \nwhile on active duty. (Tr. 34-39; App. Ex. D, Appointment Order, dated June 5, 1968; \nApp. Ex. E, Special Orders, dated June 9, 1971; App. Ex. F, DD 214, dated August 15, \n1972)  \n \n \nAfter leaving the Air Force, Applicant worked for defense contractors in the \ncomputer field, and his clearance was ungraded to top secret. (App. Ex. G, Letter, dated \nJuly 28, 1980) His clearance was again upgraded based on a special background \ninvestigation to permit work in the intelligence field. (App. Ex. H, Security Information, \ndated June 16, 1981) Shortly thereafter, he left employment with the defense \ncontractors and had no requirement for access to classified information. However, he \nwas a contractor working in the nuclear field for the United States Department of \nEnergy. He represented the United States in some aspects of the nuclear program with \nthe International Atomic Energy Agency and held the equivalent of a top secret \nclearance for them. His defense contractor employer had a contract with the Internal \nRevenue Service (IRS). To accomplish his duties, he was granted unescorted access to \nsensitive information by the IRS. However, his 2006 application for a top secret \nequivalent nuclear clearance from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission was denied \nbased on guidelines B and C security concerns without explanation in January 2006. \n(Tr. 40-46, 57-58; App. Ex. I, Letter, dated December 18, 2008)  \n \n \nEstonia became an independent country again when the Soviet Union collapsed \nin 1991. He was considered by Estonia to be a dual citizen of the United States and \nEstonia. He registered for and received a certificate permitting him to vote in the \nEstonian elections in 2002. He also voted in the elections in 2007. His primary reason \nfor voting was to vote for very pro-American candidates. He was not encouraged by any \nofficial in the United States to vote in Estonia. He does not intend to vote in any further \n\n4 \n \nEstonian elections because he feels Estonia has established itself and can stand on its \naccomplishments. Neither he nor his family received any educational benefits from \nEstonia. They are also not entitled to any other benefits from Estonia. The only family \nmember who may have received medical benefits from Estonia is his daughter who \nworks for the Estonian government. (Tr. 56-57) \n \n \nApplicant worked for Estonia in 2006-2007 as a private contractor translating \ncyber defense security documents into English. He was hired by an Estonian friend who \nwas president of an Estonian computer company. He was paid in European currency \n(Euros) for his work on the project. He also worked on the computer technology part of \na project to clean up a former nuclear site in Estonia left by the departing Soviet Union \nforces. Taxes were withheld by Estonia from his payments for these services but were \nrefunded when he declared the income on his United States tax returns and paid tax on \nthe income in the United States. (Tr. 59-67; App. Ex. Y, Summary Report, dated \nOctober 5, 2010)  \n \n \nIn 2003, he learned of a potential business prospect working for a company \ndoing process reengineering for an Estonian agency. He had to be an Estonian citizen \nto work on the project because funding was provided by the European Union. Applicant \napplied for and was issued an Estonian passport in July 2003. The passport expires in \nJuly 2013. The process to obtain the passport was difficult and complicated. He had to \nverify his parents were Estonian citizens, provide proof he was their son, and go to \nEstonia to apply. He obtained evidence of his parents' citizenship from Estonian \nrecords, and his birth to them from German records. He had to go to Estonia to apply for \nand receive the passport. He could not apply at the Estonian Embassy in the United \nStates. He did not have to take an oath of affirmation to the Estonian government to \nobtain the passport. He used the passport to enter Estonia as a matter of convenience \nin July 2004, October 2005, December 2005, March 2007, and February 2009. He used \nthe passport as identification to purchase a condominium. (Tr. 50-56; Gov. Ex. 4, \nAnswers to Interrogatories, date April 16, 2009) He recently surrendered the passport to \nhis company's security officer. (App. Ex. M and App. Ex. Z, Affidavit, dated October 6, \n2010) \n \n \nApplicant owns a condominium used as a vacation home and a place to stay \nwhen he visits Estonia. He paid approximately $64,000 for the condominium and made \nover $15,000 in improvements. He obtained a loan from an Estonian bank for the \npurchase. He paid the mortgage using a bank account in an Estonian bank. He has paid \nthe mortgage and the property is now valued at approximately $160,000. He still \nmaintains the bank account using it to pay for maintenance on the condominium. (Tr. \n66-70, 74-75) Applicant and his wife's total net worth in the United States in property \nand accounts is approximately $1,000,000. \n \n \nApplicant has a friendship and relationship with a current high ranking Estonian \nofficial. The official was born in Europe when his parents were refugees from the Soviet \nforces, and immigrated to the United States and settled in the same state but not the \nsame town as Applicant's family. However, they both attended a Boy Scout camp for \nEstonian-American boys and Applicant served as his counselor in the camp because he \n\n5 \n \nwas older than him. Before he was elected to his present position in Estonia, he served \nin another high ranking position and Applicant saw him on occasion. He returned to \nEstonia to take another government position. Applicant has had little if any contact with \nhim since he returned to Estonia and was elected to the high ranking position. Applicant \nmay attend a reception at the embassy for the official but Applicant would be just one of \nthe people at the reception. Applicant admits he knows other high ranking people in the \nEstonian government. However since 2008, there have not been any appointees to high \nlevel positions that he knows. (Tr. 70-74) Applicant is still involved with the Estonian-\nAmerican Boy Scout camp as a volunteer caring for the equipment in the camp. (Tr. 78- \n80) \n \n \nApplicant was pleased when the yoke of Soviet occupation was lifted from \nEstonia in 1991. He felt a cultural and heredity connection to Estonia and relieved for \nhis cousins still in the country. He reads an Estonian-American newspaper on occasion \nbut the news is mainly about Estonians in the United States and Canada. He does not \nfollow political events in Estonia even though his friend is the president and will be up \nfor reelection in 2012. While Applicant is in agreement with the pro-western movement \nin Estonia, he does not have a sense of loyalty to them. Estonia has progressed to the \npoint that it has a well-established parliamentary system, follows a rule of law, and has \na transparent government open to all people. He followed the events concerning the \nSoviet invasion of Georgia and the Estonian president's solidarity against the invasion \nwith other presidents from Baltic countries. He does not have regular contact with \nanyone in Estonia other than his daughter. Applicant at one time thought about retiring \nin Estonia but he no longer has the desire. He intends to spend time in Estonia but not \nretire there because the medical care is not as good as in the United States. Applicant's \nconnection to Estonia is based on heritage and culture but his loyalty is unequivocally \nwith the United States. (Tr. 80-94) \n \n \nApplicant's wife gave testimony at the hearing in support of her husband. The \nother witness is a retired Air Force major general of Estonia heritage who served over \n28 years on active duty. She met Applicant and his wife at an Estonian-American \ncultural event in approximately 1998. Applicant's life story is similar to her story since \nshe was also born in the same refugee camp as Applicant. Her family settled in another \nnortheastern state and she attended school and obtained a degree and a commission \nthrough the ROTC program. As other refugees, she is so profoundly grateful for the \nrefuge given her by the United States and the opportunities presented to her that she \njoined and served in the armed forces. She served as a military attach\u00e9 in the Baltic and \nhas visited Estonia. She knows of no Estonian person who willingly became a United \nStates citizen that would choose Estonia over the United States. She knows Applicant \nand he would not choose Estonia over the United States. She has positive feelings \nconcerning Applicant's reliability, trustworthiness, judgment, and loyalty. If she were in a \nposition, she would hire Applicant and recommend him for a security clearance. (129-\n138)   \n \n \nApplicant presented a letter of recommendation form one of his former \nsupervisors. The supervisor has known Applicant since 1995 and worked closely with \nApplicant on projects until 1998. During this time, they had a close personal relationship \n\n6 \n \nwhile working and traveling on projects. Since they stopped working together in 1998, \nhe has kept in close contact with Applicant. The supervisor holds a security clearance \nand is well aware of the requirements for a security clearance. He is aware of \nApplicant's dual citizenship with Estonia and his activities and trips to Estonia. He knows \nof nothing to doubt Applicant's trustworthiness or loyalty. (App. Ex. J, Letter, dated \nOctober 3, 2010) \n \n \nEstonia is a country of approximately 1.4 million people, with a parliamentary \ndemocracy under a Constitution in force since 1992. The head of state is the President \nelected for a five-year term. He mainly has a representational role with some executive \npowers. He is the supreme commander of the armed forces. The national legislature is \na unicameral parliament of 101 members elected for four year terms. The executive \npower is exercised by the Prime Minister appointed by the parliament.  \n \n \nThe United States recognized Estonia in 1922 and continued its recognition \nduring the illegal occupation of Estonia by the Soviet Union from 1940 until 1991. The \nUnited States recognized the legal representative of Estonia and never recognized the \nSoviet annexation. This recognition has been the cornerstone of Estonian-United States \nrelationships. The bilateral relationship between Estonia and the United States has \nbeen steady and strong since Estonia restored its independence in 1991. The \ndeveloping relationship has been constructive and stable. The United States is one of \nEstonia's most important partners. The strong bilateral relationship is corroborated by \nthe dialogue between the countries in several matters of great importance to Estonia as \nwell as the United States. There is practical cooperation in the areas of defense, \ninternational fight against terrorism, economic cooperation, and crime prevention. \n \n \nEstonia became a member of NATO on March 29, 2004, and a member of the \nEuropean Union on May 1, 2004. These memberships show a strong strengthening \nrelationship with Estonia and members of the alliance and the United States. The United \nStates played a decisive role in Estonia's approval to be a member of NATO. Estonia \nhas participated in the United States led NATO military operations in Afghanistan since \n2002. They also participated in the NATO Kosovo operation in 1999, and in Iraq from \n2003 until 2008. (App. Ex. O, Estonia 2010; App. Ex. Q, Estonia and the European \nUnion, dated June 18, 2010; App. Ex. R, Estonia and the United Nations, dated April 2, \n2010; App. Ex S, Estonia and the US, undated; App. Ex. T, Estonia as a full member of \nNATO, undated; App. Ex U, COE Status Map, dated September 29, 2010; App. Ex. V, \nHistory of Deployments since 1995, undated; App. Ex. W, Country Reports on Terrorism \n2009, dated August 2010; and App. Ex. X, Embassy of the United States, Speeches \nand articles, date June 14, 2010)  \n \nPolicy \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which must be considered in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n\n7 \n \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline B: Foreign Influence \n \n \nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual has \ndivided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or induced to help a \nforeign person, group, organization, or government in a way that is not in the U.S. \ninterests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Adjudication \nunder this guideline can and should consider the identity of the foreign country in which \nthe foreign contact or financial interest is located, including but not limited to, such \nconsideration as whether the foreign country is known to target United States citizens to \nobtain protected information and/or is associated with a risk of terrorism. (AG \u00b6 6)  \n \n \nApplicant's daughter is a dual citizen of Estonia and the United States who lives \nin Estonia and is employed as a translator and press and information officer for the \nEstonian foreign ministry. Applicant's wife is also a dual citizen of Estonia and the \n\n8 \n \nUnited States but resides in the United States. They have contact with relatives and \nfriends in Estonia. They also know and occasionally see high ranking Estonian \ngovernment officials, including legislators. Applicant and his wife have done translation \nwork for Estonia government agencies. They also travel to Estonia about once a year, \nown a condominium in Estonia, and frequently attend events at the Estonia Embassy. \nThese contacts, relationships, activities, and property ownership are a security concern \nand raise Foreign Influence Disqualifying Conditions (FI DC) AG \u00b6 7(a) (contact with a \nforeign family member, business or professional associate, friend, or other person who \nis a citizen of or resident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion); and FI DC AG \u00b6 \n7(b) (connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that create a \npotential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to protect sensitive \ninformation or technology and the individual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person, group, or \ncountry by providing that information); FI DC AG \u00b6 8(d) (sharing living quarters with a \nperson or persons, regardless of citizenship status, if that relationship creates a \nheightened risk of foreign inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion); and FI DC \nAG \u00b6 8(e) (a substantial business, financial, or property interest in a foreign country, or \nin a foreign-owned or foreign-operated business which could subject the individual to \nheightened risk of foreign influence or exploitation). The Government's security concern \nis based on the strength and depth of Applicant's connections to Estonia and people in \nthe government, and not any heightened risk created by Estonia. (Tr. 163-164) \n \n \nThe mere existence of foreign relationships and contacts is not sufficient to raise \nthe above disqualifying conditions. The nature of Applicant\u2019s contacts and relationships \nmust be examined to determine whether it creates a heightened risk of foreign \nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion. \u201cHeightened\u201d is a relative \nterm denoting increased risk compared to some normally existing risk that can be \ninherent anytime there are foreign contacts and relationships. A factor that may \nheighten the risk in Applicant's case is the extent, degree, and level of his connection to \nEstonia, its government, its leaders, and its people.  \n \n \nApplicant raised facts to mitigate the security concerns for contacts and \nrelationships with people in Estonia. I have considered Foreign Influence Mitigating \nConditions (FI MC) AG \u00b6 8(a) (The nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the \ncountry in which these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a \nposition of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, group, \norganization, or government and the interests of the U.S.); FI MC AG \u00b6 8(b) (There is no \nconflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of loyalty or obligation to the \nforeign person, group, government, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such \ndeep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be \nexpected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest); and FI MC AG \u00b6 \n8(c) (Contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual or infrequent that there \nis little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign influence or exploitation). \n \n \nThe contacts with high level officials in Estonia place a heavy burden on \nApplicant in mitigating the disqualifying conditions and the security concerns. Applicant's \n\n9 \n \nrelationship with his daughter in Estonia is, of course, close and frequent as a \nrelationship between father and daughter. He talks to her frequently and sees her when \nhe visits Estonia. Also of concern is that he knows and does have some contact with \nhigh level Estonian officials. However, his contact with these Estonian officials is \nminimal, casual, and infrequent at best. There is little if any likelihood that these \ncontacts will create a risk of foreign influence or exploitation. Applicant's vacation \nproperty in Estonia is valuable, but it is only about ten percent of his total worth. The \nnature of Estonian and United States' interests and the small value of the property \nrelative to Applicant's total net worth would not place Applicant at a heightened risk of \nforeign influence or exploitation. \n \n \nThe interests of Estonia and the United States are close since the United States \nwas a proponent of Estonian independence even when Estonia was occupied by the \nSoviet Union. The United States strongly backed Estonia for membership in NATO and \nthe European Union. Estonia reciprocated for this support by being a strategic partner \nwith the United States participating and supporting the United States and NATO in \ndefense operations in Kosovo, Iraq and Afghanistan. There is no doubt the United \nStates and Estonia are strong allies with close mutual interests. There is a minimal \ndifference between the interests of Estonia and the interests of the United States. There \nis little likelihood Applicant will be placed in a position to have to chose between the \ninterests of his contacts in Estonia and the interests of the United States.  \n \n \nMore important, Applicant has a strong sense of loyalty to the United States. He \ncame to the United States as a refugee and had such a profound sense of obligation for \nthe opportunities he received that he served in the armed forces. His sense of loyalty to \nEstonia is minimal and is based on culture and heritage and not from a sense of loyalty \nto Estonia or its government. He can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in \nfavor of the United States because of this strong sense of loyalty to the United States. It \nis inconceivable that Applicant will be placed in a position of having to choose between \nhis contacts and interests in Estonia and the interests of the United States. In balancing \nall of the factors mentioned and considered above, I am satisfied Applicant\u2019s loyalty to \nthe United States is such that he can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in \nfavor of the United States interest. Accordingly, FI MC AG \u00b6 8(a), FI MC AG \u00b6 8(b), and \nFI MC AG \u00b6 8(c) apply. Applicant has met his heavy burden to show that his contacts \nand relationships with Estonia do not cause a security concern. I conclude Applicant \nhas mitigated security concerns for contacts with Estonia.  \n \nGuideline C, Foreign Preference \n \n \nWhen an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a foreign \ncountry over the United States, then he may be prone to provide information or make \ndecisions that are harmful to the interests of the United States. (AG \u00b6 9) The principal \ngoal of the foreign preference assessment is to determine the risk, based on foreign \nassociations, that information may be compromised if access to sensitive information is \napproved. It is not a measure of Applicant's loyalty to the United States. \n \n\n10 \n \n \nApplicant is a dual citizen of Estonia and the United States. He came to the \nUnited States as a three-year-old refugee and became a citizen in 1960 as a teenager. \nHe affirmatively applied for Estonian citizenship in 2003, and is considered a citizen of \nEstonia because of his birth to Estonian parents. He applied for an Estonian passport in \n2003 to facilitate his entry and permit and enhance business interests in Estonia. He \nuses this passport to be employed in Estonia and other European Union countries. He \nvoted in Estonian elections, paid taxes in Estonia, and used his passport and citizenship \nto obtain property in Estonia. These actions raise Foreign Preference Disqualifying \nCondition (FP DC) AG \u00b6 10(a) (Exercise of any right, privilege, or obligation of foreign \ncitizenship after becoming a United States citizen or through the foreign citizenship of a \nfamily member. This includes but is not limited to: (1) possession of a current foreign \npassport), (5) using foreign citizenship to protect financial or business interest in another \ncountry, and (7) voting in a foreign election.  \n \nIn response to this disqualifying condition, Applicant raised Foreign Preference \nMitigating Conditions (FP MC) AG \u00b6 11(b) (The individual has expressed a willingness \nto renounce dual citizenship), and FP MC AG \u00b6 11(e) (The passport has been \ndestroyed, surrendered to the cognizant security authority, or otherwise invalidated). \nThe United States Supreme Court has recognized a right under the United States \nConstitution for United States citizens to have a dual citizenship with another country. \n(Afroyim v. Rusk, 387 U.S. 253 (1967). The mere fact that a United States citizen is \neligible for dual citizenship with another country is not a security concern. Applicant has \nnot indicated his intent to renounce his dual citizenship with Estonia. His failure to \nrenounce dual citizenship is not a disqualifying condition since the renunciation of a dual \ncitizenship is very often a meaningless gesture because of the citizenship laws of the \nother nation. The exercise of dual citizenship does create a security concern.  \n \nApplicant has exercised his rights as a dual citizen. He applied for foreign \ncitizenship, obtained a foreign passport, purchased a vacation home in a foreign \ncountry, and voted in a foreign election before he applied for a security clearance. \nApplicant has surrendered his passport to the appropriate security authority of his \ncompany. His business interests in Estonia are limited to his condominium which he \npurchased as a vacation home and a place to stay when he visits that country. While he \nhas voted in past Estonian elections, his purpose was to elect candidates favorable to \nUnited States' interests. He does not intend to vote in future Estonian elections. As \nnoted under the Guideline B analysis, Applicant has a profound sense of loyalty to the \nUnited States and his loyalty to Estonia is based only on culture and heritage. His \nexercise of any rights and privileges of Estonian citizenship was for business and \neconomic reasons and does not show any conflict between his loyalty to the United \nStews and his loyalty to Estonia. Applicant has, therefore, mitigated security concerns \nfor his exercise of foreign citizenship with Estonia. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \n\n11 \n \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for access to \nsensitive information must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I carefully considered all of the \ncircumstances discussed above in regard to disqualifying and mitigating conditions as \nwell as the following factors in light of the whole person concept. I considered that \nApplicant is a refugee from communism who came as a youth to the United States and \nbecame a citizen. I considered that he received an Air Force commission and served on \nactive duty with a security clearance. I considered that he was granted access to \nclassified information and sensitive information from other government agencies, but \nwas also denied access to sensitive nuclear information by a government agency under \nthe same circumstances presented here.  \n \nThe whole-person concept requires consideration of all available information \nabout Applicant, not a single item in isolation, to reach a determination concerning \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to sensitive information. Applicant has relationships and \ncontacts with officials in Estonia. His daughter is also a citizen and resident of Estonia. \nThese facts alone might be sufficient to raise security concerns for Applicant\u2019s potential \nvulnerability to coercion, exploitation, or pressure. However, Applicant has established \nhis strong loyalties to the United States. He also established he has no real loyalty to \nEstonia. Estonia is a strong ally of the United States with mutual interests and concerns. \nApplicant's strong loyalty to the United States and the relationship between the United \nStates and Estonia counters any contacts and relationships he has with Estonia and \npeople who reside there or are in the government. Overall, on balance, the record \nevidence leaves me without questions or doubts about Applicant\u2019s eligibility and \nsuitability for access to classified information. Applicant's connections to Estonia do not \ncreate a heightened risk related to national security. For all these reasons, I conclude \nApplicant has met the heavy burden of mitigating all potential security concerns arising \nfrom his contacts in Estonia, as well as his exercise of citizenship in Estonia. Applicant \nhas mitigated the security concerns arising from foreign influence and foreign \npreference, and is granted access to classified information. \n \n \n\n12 \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n  For Applicant \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b (1-6): \n \n  For Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline C:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a - s: \n \n  For Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for access to \nclassified information. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n \n_________________ \nTHOMAS M. CREAN \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Accordingly, his request for a security \nclearance is denied. \n \n \nOn July 22, 2008, Applicant submitted a security clearance application \n(Standard Form 86) to request a security clearance required as part of his \n \n 1  \nAugust 17, 2009\n\n \n 2  \n                                                     \nemployment with a defense contractor. After reviewing the results of the ensuing \nbackground investigation, adjudicators for the Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals (DOHA) were unable to make a preliminary affirmative finding1 that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s request.  \n \n \nOn February 2, 2009, DOHA issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons \n(SOR) that specified the basis for its decision: security concerns addressed in the \nDirective under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of the Revised \nAdjudicative Guidelines (AG).2 In his Answer to the SOR, signed and notarized \non March 19, 2009, Applicant admitted all the allegations under Guideline F. He \nalso requested a hearing before an administrative judge.  \n \nDepartment Counsel was prepared to proceed on May 1, 2009 and the \ncase was assigned to me on May 4, 2009. DOHA issued a Notice of Hearing on \nMay 5, 2009 and I convened the hearing as scheduled on May 28, 2009. During \nthe hearing, the government offered three exhibits, marked as Government \nExhibits (GE) 1 through 3, which were admitted without objection. Applicant \ntestified, and offered five exhibits, which were marked as Applicant\u2019s Exhibits \n(AE) A through E and admitted without objection. He did not present witnesses or \ncharacter references. DOHA received the transcript on June 4, 2009. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions in response to the SOR are admitted as fact. After \na thorough review of the pleadings, Applicant\u2019s response to the SOR, and the \nevidence presented by both parties, I make the following additional findings of \nfact. \n \n \nApplicant, 30 years old, completed one year of college courses in 1997, \nplus several additional courses since then. He is currently employed as a project \nmanager for a defense contractor. He married in 2002 and divorced in 2005. He \nhas one seven-year-old son, who lives in Germany with Applicant's ex-wife, a \nU.S. Army member. Applicant served in the Army from 1998 to December 2007 \nas a petroleum supply specialist, and was honorably discharged as a Staff \nSergeant (E-6). He saw combat during his service in Iraq, from April 2003 to July \n2004. His wife served at the same time in the same division, and while both \nparents were deployed, their son, who was approximately one-and-a-half years \nold at the time, lived with a German family. After leaving active duty, Applicant \n \n1  Required by Executive Order 10865, as amended, and by DoD Directive 5220.6 (Directive), as \namended. \n \n2 Adjudication of this case is controlled by the Revised Adjudicative Guidelines, approved by the \nPresident on December 29, 2005, which were implemented by the Department of Defense on \nSeptember 1, 2006. The Revised Adjudicative Guidelines supersede the guidelines listed in \nEnclosure 2 to the Directive, and they apply to all adjudications or trustworthiness determinations \nin which an SOR was issued on or after September 1, 2006. \n\n \n 3  \n                                                     \njoined the Army Reserves. Currently, he is in the Inactive Reserve (GE 1; Tr. 34, \n37-39, 41-42, 46-48, 52-53). \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s divorce in 2005 affected him financially. His wife retained most \nof their goods. Applicant used credit cards and the military exchange service to \nset up a new household. The military exchange debt of $4,000 to $5,000 became \ndelinquent.3 The Internal Revenue Service applied his 2008 federal income tax \nrefund to this debt. However, Applicant was able to stay current on most of his \nother debts while he was on active duty (AE A; Tr. 20-21). \n \n \nIn 2007, Applicant decided to leave military service and accepted an offer \nfor a position that was to begin when he detached. After he submitted his papers, \nand two weeks before detachment, the employer informed him that the contract \nhad been lost and the position was no longer available. Applicant decided to \nrelocate to Puerto Rico, where he was born and has relatives. He expected to be \nable to on find employment, and also rely on his Reserve pay, and bonuses \namounting to approximately $10,000. He planned to attend college with funding \nthrough the G.I. bill (GE 2, 3; Tr. 21, 44-45, 50, 70). \n \n \nApplicant bought a new car in June 2007, several months before leaving \nmilitary service, for $22,000. His monthly payments were $600. He contacted the \ncreditor who held his car loan about transporting his car to Puerto Rico. He was \ninformed that he could not take it because the loan was not paid in full. However, \nhe was told that because he was moving on military orders, he could return the \ncar, which would not be considered a repossession, and he would owe no further \npayments. Relying on this advice, Applicant returned the car. However, the \nunpaid balance (allegation 1.c.) now appears on Applicant's credit bureau report. \nWhen he contacted the company, he was referred to a collection agency. He is \nupset that he was given false information. However, he agrees the debt is his \nresponsibility, and he intends to pay it. He is awaiting further information from the \ncollection agency (GE 2; Tr. 19-20, 65-68, 74). \n \n \nApplicant lived in Puerto Rico from December 2007 to April 2008. After he \ncompleted college courses, he was informed that the G.I. bill would not cover \nthem because they did not lead to a degree. He drilled with the Reserves, but did \nnot receive the drill pay until after he returned to the United States. He purchased \na new car, but surrendered it to the dealer after one or two months when he \nrealized he could not make the payments.4 Applicant was unable to find a \nposition in Puerto Rico and was unemployed for approximately four months. He \ndecided the best way to pay his mounting bills and support his son was to seek \nemployment in the United States (GE 2, 3; Tr. 21-22, 50-51, 75).  \n \n3 This debt is not alleged in the SOR and is not a determining factor in my conclusions. \n \n4 In about mid-2008, Applicant contacted the creditor and was told that the car had been sold, \nand he did not owe a balance. However, the account appears on his credit bureau report as a \npast-due debt. This debt is not alleged in the SOR and is not a determining factor in my \nconclusions.  \n\n \n 4  \n                                                     \n \n \nApplicant returned to the United States in about April 2008. He had no \nfunds and was homeless and \u201con the streets\u201d for two weeks. Between April 2008 \nand 2009, he obtained several positions with defense contractors, steadily \nincreasing his salary, until joining his current employer. Between mid-2008 and \nearly 2009, Applicant started paying on bank loans and credit cards that were \npast due (unalleged), each of which amounted to several thousand dollars. The \n2008 and 2009 credit bureau reports show that these accounts are either closed \nor up-to-date. The bills alleged in the SOR are those that he was not able to pay \nover the past year. As of the date of the hearing, he was beginning to pay on the \nSOR debts. Some of the creditors he contacted would not accept payment plans, \nand Applicant was unable to pay the balances in one payment. He was also \nhesitant to commit to payment plans because if he lost his security clearance, \nand his job, he would be unable to complete the plan. Applicant testified that he \nexpects to have all the SOR debts paid by December of this year, with the \nexception of the car loan alleged at 1.c., which will take longer to pay (GE 2, 3; \nAE C; Tr. 22-25, 51). \n \n \nIn his first position after returning to the U.S., Applicant\u2019s annual salary \nwas $40,000. He worked a partial year in 2008, and his income tax return shows \ntotal income of $36,813. He increased his income to his current gross annual \nsalary of $65,000, and he has a job offer for a position that would pay $85,000. \nHis gross monthly take-home pay is approximately $3,300. Applicant pays child \nsupport of $350 per month. He shares an apartment and his portion of the rent is \n$900 per month, including utilities. His monthly net remainder is approximately \n$100. He purchased a four-year-old car in December 2008. His monthly car \npayment is $430 and the loan is up-to-date. He has about $60 in a checking \naccount and no savings. He has no credit card accounts. Applicant has not \nattended financial counseling (AE D, E5; Tr. 25-26, 35, 47-48, 72-74, 96-101). \n \n \nAll of the debts alleged in the SOR, totaling almost $28,000, became \ndelinquent between February and June 2008. The current status of each follows.  \n \n$ \nCredit card - $4,991 (allegation 1.a.): Applicant planned to begin \npaying the debt and contacted the creditor. However, at about \nthat time he learned of an unanticipated debt to the state \ndepartment of motor vehicles, and used his savings to pay that \ndebt instead. He contacted the creditor again in approximately \nMarch 2009 to explain his situation. He intends to pay the bill but \ndoes not have a payment plan in place (GE 3; AE B; Tr. 54-62).  \n \n$ \nComputer purchase - $2,378 (allegation 1.b.): Applicant bought \na computer in 2007 for approximately $1,200. He contacted the \ncollection agency in March 2009 hoping to establish a payment \n \n5 AE D and E are unsigned and undated copies of Applicant's 2008 federal and state income tax \nreturns. \n\n \n 5  \n                                                     \nplan of $100 to $200 per month, but the agency demanded a \n$500 initial payment and followed by three $600 monthly \npayments. Applicant could not afford the arrangement, and the \nsituation remains unresolved (GE 1, 2, 3; AE B; Tr. 39, 62-65). \n \n$ \nAuto loan - $18,995 (allegation 1.c.): As discussed previously, \nApplicant was told this car loan would be discharged because he \nwas returning the car before leaving the country on military travel \norders. However, the balance of the loan appears on Applicant's \ncredit report. He intends to pay the debt but does not have a \npayment plan in place (GE 2, 3; Tr.66-68, 74). \n \n$   \nTelephone debt - $182 (allegation 1.d.): Applicant paid the debt \nin full and provided supporting documentation (GE 2; AE C; Tr. \n78-79). \n \n$   \nCable service debts - $540; $278 (allegations 1.e. and 1.f.): \nApplicant and his mother lived together in the United States \nbefore his move to Puerto Rico. When he left, she moved to \nanother state and took the cable receivers with her, resulting in \nthe debt of $278. His mother later returned the receivers and the \ncompany is currently verifying their return. Applicant believes that \nhe no longer owes the debt. Applicant disputes the debt for $540 \nbecause the company continued to charge him for service for \nJanuary through March 2008, after he left the United States, \ndespite Applicant's providing notice that he was leaving. He \noffered no documentation to support his contentions as to the \nstatus of these two debts (GE 2; Tr. 80-84). \n \n$   \nCredit card - $592 (allegation 1.g.): Applicant contacted the \ncompany shortly before the hearing and arranged a payment \nplan of $200 per month for three months. The first payment was \nto be made the day after the hearing, when Applicant would \nreceive his paycheck. Applicant provided no supporting \ndocumentation during or after the hearing concerning this \npayment plan (GE 2; Tr. 24; 84-87). \n \nPolicies \n \n \nEach security clearance decision must be a fair, impartial, and common-\nsense determination based on examination of all available relevant and material \ninformation, and consideration of the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in \nthe Revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG).6 Decisions must also reflect \n \n6 Directive 6.3 \n \n\n \n 6  \n                                                     \nconsideration of the factors listed in \u00b6 2(a) of the Guidelines, commonly referred \nto as the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept. \n \n \nThe presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition does \nnot determine a conclusion for or against an Applicant. However, specific \napplicable guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured \nagainst them as they represent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of \naccess to classified information. In this case, the pleadings and the information \npresented by the parties require consideration of the security concerns and \nadjudicative factors addressed under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) at \nAG \u00b6 18. \n \n \nA security clearance decision is intended only to resolve whether it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest7 for an Applicant to either receive or \ncontinue to have access to classified information. The government bears the \ninitial burden of producing admissible information on which it based the \npreliminary decision to deny or revoke a security clearance for an Applicant. \nAdditionally, the government must be able to prove controverted facts alleged in \nthe SOR. If the government meets its burden, it then falls to the Applicant to \nrefute, extenuate or mitigate the government\u2019s case.  \n \n \nBecause no one has a \u201cright\u201d to a security clearance, an Applicant bears a \nheavy burden of persuasion.8 A person who has access to classified information \nenters into a fiduciary relationship with the government based on trust and \nconfidence. Therefore, the government has a compelling interest in ensuring \neach Applicant possesses the judgment, reliability and trustworthiness to protect \nthe national interests as his or his own. The \u201cclearly consistent with the national \ninterest\u201d standard compels resolution of any reasonable doubt about an \nApplicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the government.9 \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \n \nAG \u00b6 18 expresses the security concern about financial considerations: \n \nFailure or inability to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and \nmeet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of \njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of \nwhich can raise questions about an individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. An \n \n7 See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988). \n \n8 See Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, 531. \n \n9 See Egan; Revised Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 2(b). \n\n \n 7  \nindividual who is financially over-extended is at risk of having to \nengage in illegal acts to generate funds. Compulsive gambling is a \nconcern as it may lead to financial crimes including espionage. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is \nalso a security concern. It may indicate proceeds from financially \nprofitable criminal acts. \n \n \nThe evidence supports application of disqualifying conditions AG \u00b619 (a) \n(inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts) and AG \u00b619 (c) (a history of not \nmeeting financial obligations). Applicant was unable to pay his debts in early \n2008, and several of these debts remain unpaid, indicating a history of failure to \nmeet financial obligations. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 20, the following potentially mitigating factors are relevant: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were \nlargely beyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a \nbusiness downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, \ndivorce or separation), and the individual acted responsibly \nunder the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the \nproblem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue \ncreditors or otherwise resolve debts; \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the \nlegitimacy of the past-due debt which is the cause of the \nproblem and provides documented proof to substantiate the \nbasis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions to resolve \nthe issue; and, \n \n \nApplicant's debts occurred under circumstances that are unlikely to recur. \nThey accrued following his detachment from military service, and a subsequent \nperiod of unemployment. He has now been employed for approximately one-and-\none-half years with a steadily increasing salary and, given that he was not \nindebted while he was receiving a steady income in the Army, it is unlikely he will \naccrue new debts. Applicant's testimony was credible and his trustworthiness is \nnot in question. AG \u00b6 20(a) applies. \n\n \n 8  \n \n \nThe circumstances that caused Applicant to become indebted were \nbeyond his control. Just before and after Applicant left military service, a \nconfluence of events caused his previously stable financial situation to \ndeteriorate: the 2007 job offer in the United States was withdrawn; the G.I. bill \nbenefits that might have paid for his schooling did not apply; and he did not \nreceive his 2008 Reserve pay until months after he completed the drills, and had \nleft Puerto Rico. However, his debts also resulted from several irresponsible \nfinancial choices. Applicant not only purchased a car before his 2007 job offer \nmaterialized, but it was a new car with a high monthly payment. He also selected \ncollege courses before ensuring that they would meet the requirements for \ncoverage by the G.I. bill, and before obtaining employment to help with \nexpenses. In addition, he purchased another new car on his arrival in Puerto \nRico, also before obtaining employment. Although Applicant acted responsibly by \npaying debts once he secured steady employment in the United States in 2008, \nhis actions in 2007 and early 2008 did contribute to his delinquencies. Only \npartial mitigation can be applied under AG \u00b6 20(b). \n \n \nNeither AG \u00b6 20(c) not AG \u00b6 20(d) applies. Applicant\u2019s financial situation is \nnot under control. He owes more than $27,000. Most of the SOR debts are \nunpaid, with no substantiated payment plans in place, and no documentation to \nsupport his claims of contacts with the creditors. Without documentation, a good-\nfaith effort to resolve debts cannot be substantiated.  \n \n \nApplicant disputes the cable debt at \u00b6 1.e. because it represents charges \nfor a time period after he discontinued the service. Again, he provided no \nevidence, such as dated bills, written notice of his move, or any other \ndocumentation that would support his dispute. AG \u00b6 20(e) does not apply. \nAlthough Applicant receives some mitigation based on AG \u00b6 20(a) and (b), I \nconclude that it is insufficient to outweigh the disqualifying conditions. I find \nagainst Applicant under Guideline F. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate \nthe Applicant\u2019s security eligibility by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. I have evaluated the facts presented and \nhave applied the appropriate adjudicative factors under the cited guideline. I have \nalso reviewed the record before me in the context of the whole-person factors \nlisted in AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the \nextent to which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or \n\n \n 9  \nabsence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; \n(7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of \ncontinuation or recurrence. \n \nAG \u00b6 2(c) requires that the ultimate determination of whether to grant a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based on careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. Under the \nappropriate guideline, I considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating \nconditions in light of all the facts and circumstances surrounding this case. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s credit bureau reports show that, in the past, he had a \nsignificant number of open accounts, but he was able to keep most of them \ncurrent while he was in the military. However, the loss of an expected civilian \nposition in 2007 set a series of events in motion that Applicant did not anticipate. \nGiven that he was in his late 20\u2019s at the time, his poor financial decisions in 2007 \nand early 2008 may result in part from inexperience and a lack of sound financial \njudgment. Numerous debts became delinquent in early 2008 because of \nunemployment, unanticipated school expenses and late Reserve drill payments. \nHowever, his questionable decisions to buy new cars, rely on employment that \ndid not materialize, begin college courses before he knew if they would be \ncovered by the G.I. bill led to a significant debt load. Applicant paid one debt, but \ndid not set up payment plans or provide evidence to support his claimed efforts to \nresolve the rest. As a result, he still carries more than $27,000 in debt, with no \ndocumented plan in place to resolve it. \n \nApplicant made efforts to bring his finances under control and succeeded \nin bringing several accounts current. However, a significant amount of debt is \nunresolved. An applicant is not required to be debt-free, or establish that he paid \nevery debt. But he must demonstrate that he established a plan to resolve his \ndebts and has taken significant action to implement that plan. Considering that \nApplicant has not established such a plan, it would be premature at this point in \ntime to grant him access to classified information.  \n \nThis decision should not be construed as a determination that Applicant \ncannot or will not attain the type of financial stability necessary to justify the \ngranting of a security clearance. The award of a security clearance is not a once \nin a life time occurrence, but is based on applying the factors, both disqualifying \nand mitigating, to the evidence presented. A clearance is not recommended \nbased on Applicant\u2019s current circumstances, but should he be afforded an \nopportunity to reapply for a security clearance in the future, having paid the \ndelinquent obligations, established a record of payments with supporting \ndocumentation, or otherwise addressed the obligations, he may well demonstrate \npersuasive evidence of his security worthiness. A fair and commonsense \nassessment of the available information bearing on Applicant\u2019s suitability for a \nsecurity clearance shows he has not satisfied the doubts raised about his \n\n \n \n10 \n \nsuitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant \nhas not mitigated the security concerns arising from the cited adjudicative \nguideline. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by \nsection E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are as follows: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a. - 1.c. \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.d.  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.e. \u2013 1.g.  \nAgainst Applicant   \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the foregoing, it is not clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to allow Applicant access to classified information. Applicant\u2019s request for \na security clearance is denied. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_\n \nRITA C. O\u2019BRIEN \nAdministrative Judge \n \n",

May 11, 2010) and\nU.S. Treasury-administered website: http://www.helpwithmybank.gov/faqs/loan general.html.\n2\nof the basis for that decision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations)\nof Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant\nrequested that the case be decided on the written record.  On October 27, 2010, after considering the\nrecord, Administrative Judge Joan Caton Anthony denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security\nclearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant to the Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s adverse decision is\narbitrary, capricious or contrary to law.\nApplicant contends that the Judge\u2019s adverse decision should be reversed because the Judge\ndid not correctly weigh the evidence under the whole-person concept and reach a commonsense\njudgment.  Specifically, he argues that the Judge did not give sufficient weight to his 26 years of\nhonorable military service, and to the fact his current financial situation is good.  With regard to the\nlatter argument, he points to the fact that many of the unpaid debts listed on the SOR have been\ncharged off by the creditors and he is in the process of getting them removed from his credit report.\nApplicant\u2019s argument does not demonstrate that the Judge\u2019s decision is arbitrary, capricious\nor contrary to law.  The presence of some mitigating evidence does not alone compel the Judge to\nmake a favorable security clearance decision.  As the trier of fact, the Judge has to weigh the\nevidence as a whole and decide whether the favorable evidence outweighs the unfavorable evidence,\nor vice versa.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-10320 at 2 (App. Bd. Nov. 7, 2007).  A party\u2019s\ndisagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, or an ability to argue for a different\ninterpretation of the evidence, is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence or\nreached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR\nCase No. 06-17409 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2007).\nIn this case, the Judge made the following relevant findings:  Applicant had four delinquent\ndebts totaling approximately $20,000.  Although Applicant had reported income and financial\nresources sufficient to pay or settle several of those debts, he had failed to do so.  He had not sought\nfinancial counseling.  While the record reflected that he disputed two of the debts, he failed to\nexplain why he was not responsible for paying them.  Decision at 6.  In light of the foregoing, the\nJudge could reasonably conclude that Applicant\u2019s financial problems were still ongoing and that he\nhad not met his burden of persuasion as to mitigation.   See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 05-07747 at 2\n(App. Bd. Jul. 3, 2007).1  \nThe Judge weighed the mitigating evidence offered by Applicant against the length and\nseriousness of the disqualifying conduct and considered the possible application of relevant\nconditions and factors.  She specifically considered Applicant 26 years of honorable military service.\nDecision at 2.  The Judge also considered Applicant\u2019s argument that because the debts have been\ncharged off by the creditors and may no appear on his credit reports, he would no longer be\n\n3\nresponsible for them.  However, she declined to accept that argument noting that \u201ca strategy of\nmerely waiting out creditors is not an adequate substitute for serious and reasonable efforts to pay\noff debts.\u201d  Decision at 6.  Although she found in favor of Applicant with respect to two of the SOR\nfactual allegations, she reasonably explained why the mitigating evidence was insufficient to\novercome the government\u2019s security concerns.  The Board does not review a case de novo.  After\nreviewing the record, the Board concludes that the Judge examined the relevant data and articulated\na satisfactory explanation for the decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the facts found\nand the choice made.\u2019\u201d Motor Vehicle Mfrs.

Crowley, Esquire, Department  Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nANTHONY, Joan Caton, Administrative Judge: \n \n \nAfter a thorough review of the case file, pleadings, and exhibits, I conclude that \nApplicant failed to rebut or mitigate the Government\u2019s security concerns under Guideline \nF, Financial Considerations. His eligibility for a security clearance is denied. \n \nApplicant completed and certified an electronic Standard Form 86 (SF-86) on \nJune 9, 2008. On February 22, 2010, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals \n(DOHA) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns \nunder Guideline F, Financial Considerations. DOHA acted pursuant to Executive Order \n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and \nOctober 27, 2010\n\n \n2 \n \n \n                                           \nthe adjudicative guidelines (AG) effective within the Department of Defense for SORs \nissued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on March 31, 2010, and requested a decision on \nthe record in lieu of a hearing. The Government compiled its File of Relevant Material \n(FORM) on August 19, 2010. The FORM contained documents identified as Items 1 \nthrough 8. By letter dated August 24, 2010, DOHA forwarded a copy of the FORM to \nApplicant, with instructions to submit any additional information and/or objections within \n30 days of receipt. Applicant received the file on September 1, 2010. His response was \ndue on October 1. 2010. He filed additional information within the required time period. \nDepartment Counsel did not object to the admission of Applicant\u2019s additional \ninformation. On October 18, 2010, the case was assigned to me for a decision. I \nadmitted to the record the additional information that Applicant provided in response to \nthe FORM. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nThe SOR contains six allegations of financial delinquency under AG F, Financial \nConsiderations. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. through 1.f.) In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant denied \nall six Guideline F allegations of financial delinquency and provided additional \ninformation (\u00b6\u00b6 1.a., 1.b., 1.c., 1.d., 1.e., and 1.f.).  (Item 1; Item 2.) \n \n \nApplicant is 48 years old, married, and the father of three children, aged 20, 18, \nand 14. Since January 2008, Applicant has been employed as a senior instructor by a \nfederal contractor. Applicant was first awarded a security clearance in 1992.1 (Item 4.) \n \n \nIn October 1981, Applicant enlisted in the United States military. He rose to the \nrank of E-8 and served on active duty for 26 years, until December 2007. In 2004, \nApplicant earned an Associate of Arts degree in Business Administration. (Item 4.)  \n \n \nIn his answer to the SOR, Applicant reported a monthly income of $8,700. He \nrents his residence and reported monthly living expenses, including his rent, of $3,200. \nApplicant stated: \u201cI\u2019m definitely not financially overextended, or living outside my means, \nwhatsoever.\u201d  (Item 2.) \n \n \n \nWhen he completed his SF-86, Applicant responded \u201cYes\u201d when asked if he had \nbeen over 180 days delinquent on any debt in the last seven years. He then provided \ninformation on several delinquent debts. He reported that a creditor was suing him to \nrecover $5,262 on an account the creditor claimed he defaulted on in March 2004 and \nwhich had not been satisfied. This debt was alleged at SOR \u00b6 1.a. In his answer to the \nSOR, Applicant provided court documents establishing that the creditor sought payment \nof the debt. In his response to the FORM, Applicant provided documentation \nestablishing that upon a motion by the creditor\u2019s counsel, the court dismissed the cause \n \n1 In his answer to the SOR, Applicant stated that he was first awarded a security clearance in \napproximately 1985. (Item 2 at 2.)  \n\n \n3 \n \n \nof action against Applicant without prejudice. (Item 1; Item 2; Item 4; Response to \nFORM at 3.) \n \n \nOn his SF-86, Applicant disclosed a delinquent credit card debt of $9,432, \nincurred in March 1995. In disclosing this debt, Applicant wrote: \u201cThis account was \nclosed and charged off. Total balance was written off.\u201d The debt is listed as 180 days \ndelinquent and the account is listed as closed on Applicant\u2019s credit report of June 19, \n2008. Applicant\u2019s credit reports of June and December 2009 state that the account was \ncharged off and that Applicant disputed the account information. This debt is alleged at \nSOR \u00b6 1.b. (Item 4; Item 5; Item 6; Item 7.) \n \n \nApplicant also identified a delinquent department store charge account on his \nSF-86. He stated that he incurred the debt, which totaled $6,769, in 1989. Applicant \nclaimed that the account was closed, charged off, and the balance was written off. \nApplicant\u2019s credit report of December 2009, established that the debt was assumed by a \nsuccessor creditor and had grown to $8,343. This debt is alleged at SOR \u00b6 1.c. (Item 4; \nItem 7.) \n \n \nOn his SF-86, Applicant also identified a delinquent debt which a creditor alleged \nhe opened in 2006. The debt appears on Applicant\u2019s credit reports of June 2008 and \nJune 2009. The SOR alleges at \u00b6 1.d. that this debt of approximately $1,701 remains \nunsatisfied. Applicant provided a letter he wrote to the creditor in May 2008 requesting \nvalidation of the debt. Applicant claimed the creditor did not respond to his request. \n(Item 2; Item 4; Item 5; Item 6.) \n \n \nWhen Applicant completed his SF-86, he also identified a credit card debt he \nincurred in 1999. He stated that the account has been closed and charged off. The \n$1,243 credit card debt appears as 180 days past due on Applicant\u2019s June 2008 credit \nreport and is alleged at SOR \u00b6 1.e. (Item 4; Item 5.) \n \n \n   The SOR alleged at \u00b6 1.f. that Applicant owes a debt of $314 for a cash \nadvance. The debt is listed as a collection account on Applicant\u2019s credit report of June \n2008. In his answer to the SOR, Applicant provided documentation establishing that the \ndebt had been satisfied in September 2008. (Item 1; Item 2; Item 5.) \n \n \nIn his answer to the SOR, Applicant attributed his financial problems to his wife\u2019s \nloss of employment in 1994: \u201cWhen my wife lost that job we took a substantial hit in our \nfinances, and even though we tried for several years, we were never able to catch-up \non our bills. I eventually told our creditors what happened, and asked them to stop \ncharging over the credit limit fees and late payments, but I was told that they would only \ndeal with a third party. . ..\u201d  In his answer to the SOR, Applicant also denied he was \nresponsible for debts that had been charged off or which no longer appeared on his \ncredit reports. The record does not support a finding that Applicant has sought or \nreceived credit counseling. (Item 2.) \n \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \n              \n \n \n \n    Policies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the \nExecutive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security, and \nit has emphasized that \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the \nNavy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the \nauthority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine \nwhether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. \nat 527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended.    \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, an   \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, the administrative judge applies these guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \nover-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \n\n \n5 \n \n \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG & 18:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under \nAG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.  \nSimilarly under AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise \nsecurity concerns. When he completed his SF-86, Applicant identified delinquent debts \nhe had accumulated and had not paid. \n \nThe record establishes that Applicant satisfied the debt alleged at SOR \u00b6 1.f. \nAdditionally, Applicant provided documentation establishing that the debt alleged at \nSOR \u00b6 1.a. had been resolved. Accordingly, these two allegations are concluded for \nApplicant. However, four of the debts alleged in the SOR remain unresolved or \nunsatisfied. This evidence is sufficient to raise potentially disqualifying conditions under \nGuideline F. \n  \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Several Guideline F mitigating conditions \ncould apply to the security concerns raised by Applicant\u2019s financial delinquencies. \nUnresolved financial delinquency might be mitigated if it happened so long ago, was so \ninfrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does \nnot cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. \n(AG \u00b6 20(a)). Additionally, unresolved financial delinquency might be mitigated if the \nconditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s \n\n \n6 \n \n \ncontrol, such as loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical \nemergency, or a death, divorce, or separation, and the individual acted responsibly \nunder the circumstances. (AG \u00b6 20(b)). Still other mitigating circumstances that might be \napplicable include evidence the person has received or is receiving counseling for the \nproblem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under \ncontrol (AG \u00b6 20(c) or the individual has initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue \ncreditors or otherwise resolve debts. (AG \u00b6 20 (d)). )).  Finally, security concerns related \nto financial delinquencies might be mitigated if \u201cthe individual has a reasonable basis to \ndispute the legitimacy of the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and \nprovides documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence \nof actions to resolve the issue.\u201d (AG \u00b6 20 (e)). \n \nApplicant has a history of financial delinquencies that dates to at least the late \n1990s. Four of his delinquencies remain unpaid, and Applicant insists that because \nthese debts have been charged off by the creditors and may no longer appear on his \ncredit reports, he is no longer responsible for them.   \n \nDOHA\u2019s Appeal Board has noted that \u201ca strategy of merely waiting out creditors \nis not an adequate substitute for serious and reasonable efforts to pay off debts.\u201d \nMoreover, it is well settled that failure to discharge debts over a period of time \nconstitutes a continuing course of conduct that raises concerns about an applicant\u2019s \nreliability and trustworthiness. ISCR Case No 07-10575 at 4 (App. Bd. Jul 3, 2008).    \n \nApplicant reports income and financial resources sufficient to pay or settle \nseveral of his delinquent debts, and he has failed to do so. Certainly, his wife\u2019s loss of a \njob in 1994, 16 years ago, was beyond Applicant\u2019s control.  However, the record does \nnot reflect that Applicant\u2019s actions in the face of his financial difficulties were reasonable \nand responsible. He has not sought financial counseling. While the record reflects that \nApplicant disputed the delinquent debts alleged at SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b. and 1.d., he failed to \nexplain why he was not responsible for paying them. He had steady employment during \nhis military service and has worked for his current employer since January 2008.  I \nconclude that AG \u00b6 20(e) applies in part in mitigation. However, I also conclude that AG \n\u00b6\u00b6 20(a), 20(b), 20(c), and 20(d) do not apply in mitigation to the facts of Applicant\u2019s \ncase. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of an applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \n\n \n7 \n \n \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(a) were \naddressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment.        \n \nApplicant is a mature adult. He has been steadily employed by his current \nemployer since January 2008, and he reports a monthly income of $8,700. Despite \nthese financial strengths, Applicant has failed to satisfy his delinquent debts. His failure \nto initiate actions to satisfy his remaining delinquent debts even when he had sufficient \nfunds to do so raises security concerns about his judgment and reliability. \n \nIn ISCR Case No. 07-08049 (App. Bd. Jul. 22, 2008), DOHA\u2019s Appeal Board \nreiterated the central concern in a security clearance adjudication in which financial \ndelinquency is at issue: \n \nA security clearance adjudication is not a proceeding aimed at collecting \nan applicant\u2019s debts. Rather, it is a proceeding aimed at evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. Accordingly, even if a \ndebt is legally unenforceable, the government is entitled to consider the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding an applicant\u2019s conduct in incurring \nthe debt and failing to satisfy it in a timely manner.  See, e.g., ISCR Case \nNo. 07-09966 at 2-3 (App. Bd. June 25, 2008). \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts at the present \ntime as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For these \nreasons, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns arising from his \nfinancial delinquencies.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST  APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a.:   \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.b. through 1.e.: Against Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.f.:  \n \nFor Applicant \n\n \n8 \n \n \n             \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n______________________ \nJoan Caton Anthony \nAdministrative Judge \n",

She also provided additional information to support her request for eligibility for a security clearance. Applicant is 31 years old and has a six-year-old son. She works for a defense contractor in the logistic business as a customer service representative. She has been so employed for four years. She graduated from college in 2002. (Tr. 19, 20, 23, 24, 25) Applicant took a weekend vacation in August 2008 with three female friends. She drank too much alcohol the evening of August 1, 2008. She met a man at a bar and they returned to the hotel room where the four women were staying. No one else was there. Applicant and her male companion engaged in sexual activity. Applicant fell asleep as a result of consuming the alcohol. The man departed later, leaving his marijuana in the room. She did not use any marijuana. The next day, August 2, 2008, the marijuana was discovered in the room by the cleaning staff. The police were called, and permission was given by the four women to have the room searched. The police found marijuana in the nightstand, a marijuana cigarette on a bench, and a cigarette paper on the floor beside a bed. After changing out of their bathing suits as the police allowed them to do, the four women were arrested.

The action \nwas taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, \nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the \nPresident on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for \nSORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on August 10, 2009. She originally \nanswered the SOR in writing on July 20, 2009, and requested a hearing before an \nadministrative judge. However, she failed to respond to the allegations in Paragraph 2, \nGuideline H, and she resubmitted a complete Answer on August 10, 2009, with her \nreceipt. DOHA received the original request on July 23, 2009. It received the \n \n1 \n \n \nFebruary 24, 2010\n\n \n2 \n \n \nresubmitted request on August 14, 2009. Department Counsel was prepared to proceed \non September 30, 2009, and I received the case assignment on October 6, 2009. \nDOHA issued a Notice of Hearing on October 29, 2009, and I convened the hearing as \nscheduled on November 17, 2009. The Government offered Exhibits 1 through 4, which \nwere received without objection. Applicant testified and submitted Exhibit A without \nobjection. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on November 25, 2009. \nBased upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for \naccess to classified information is granted. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn her Answer to the SOR, dated July 20, 2009, Applicant admitted the factual \nallegations in the SOR. She also provided additional information to support her request \nfor eligibility for a security clearance.   \n \n \nApplicant is 31 years old and has a six-year-old son. She works for a defense \ncontractor in the logistic business as a customer service representative. She has been \nso employed for four years. She graduated from college in 2002. (Tr. 19, 20, 23, 24, 25) \n \n \nApplicant took a weekend vacation in August 2008 with three female friends. She \ndrank too much alcohol the evening of August 1, 2008. She met a man at a bar and \nthey returned to the hotel room where the four women were staying. No one else was \nthere. Applicant and her male companion engaged in sexual activity. Applicant fell \nasleep as a result of consuming the alcohol. The man departed later, leaving his \nmarijuana in the room. She did not use any marijuana. The next day, August 2, 2008, \nthe marijuana was discovered in the room by the cleaning staff. The police were called, \nand permission was given by the four women to have the room searched. The police \nfound marijuana in the nightstand, a marijuana cigarette on a bench, and a cigarette \npaper on the floor beside a bed. After changing out of their bathing suits as the police \nallowed them to do, the four women were arrested. (Tr. 21, 26-33, 44; Exhibits 2-4) \n \n \nApplicant and her three friends were charged with possession of marijuana under \n100 grams and possession of drug paraphernalia. Applicant pled no contest to the \ncharges, paid a fine of $130, and received three days in jail, which was suspended. She \ndid not receive probation. She had her driving license suspended for six months. She is \ncurrently pursuing a petition in the state court to have her record expunged, based on \nthe advice given her by the sentencing judge. Two of the other women hired attorneys \nand the charges against them were dismissed. Applicant could not afford to hire an \nattorney at that time. The fourth woman pled no contest and received the same \nsentence as Applicant. (Tr. 22, 33-35; Exhibits 2-4) \n \n \nApplicant denies using drugs because of her responsibilities as a working single \nmother. She has not participated in any drug program, nor was she ordered to do so. \nShe has not participated in any alcohol treatment program, nor was she ordered to do \nso. Applicant continues to drink alcohol several times a year. She used marijuana twice \nin high school in 1994, which was given to her by a boyfriend. Applicant has not \n\n \n3 \n \n \nengaged in such weekend trips or risky behavior since this one-time incident. \nApplicant\u2019s testimony about the events was direct, persuasive, and credible. (Tr. 19-22, \n35, 39) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s employer submitted a statement on her behalf. The employer\u2019s vice \npresident stated Applicant was hired in June 2005 and has been given greater \nresponsibilities within the company since 2005. The company regards Applicant as a \n\u201cvaluable asset\u201d and she \u201cdoes not pose a risk for the Government.\u201d (Exhibit A) \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information.  Decisions include, by necessity, consideration \nof the possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \n\n \n4 \n \n \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct \n \n \nAG \u00b6 30 expresses the security concern pertaining to criminal conduct: \n \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person's ability \nor willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 31 describes five conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. Two conditions are applicable: \n \n(a) a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses; and \n \n(c) allegation or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the \nperson was formally charged, formally prosecuted or convicted. \n \n \nApplicant was charged in 2008 with possession of less than 100 grams of \nmarijuana and possession of drug paraphernalia. Her three friends on that weekend trip \nwere also charged with the same offenses. The marijuana was found in the hotel room \nwhere the four of them stayed over a weekend. There was also a male visitor of \nApplicant\u2019s acquaintance in the room for several hours the night before the marijuana \nwas found by the cleaning staff. Applicant pled no contest to the charges and received a \nminimal sentence. One of her friends followed the same procedure and received the \nsame sentence. The other two women hired attorneys who extricated them from the \ncharges, which were eventually dismissed. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 32 provides four conditions that could mitigate security concerns. Three of \nthese conditions are applicable: \n \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment; \n \n(c) evidence that the person did not commit the offense; and \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited \nto the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or \nrestitution, job training or higher education, good employment record, or \nconstructive community involvement. \n \n \nThe circumstances of Applicant\u2019s marijuana charges in 2008 occurred in unusual \nand unique circumstances. After drinking too much at a bar the night of August 1, 2008, \nshe brought a stranger back to her hotel room for sexual activity on her weekend out \nwith some female friends. She has not engaged in such weekend trips since then. She \ntakes her responsibility for her son very seriously, and does not want to endanger \nherself or him with risky behavior as she did in 2008. It is unlikely to recur. That incident \ndoes not cast doubt on her reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment as shown by \nher employer\u2019s very favorable comments about her work performance and \nadvancements since 2005, and particularly after that event. AG \u00b6 32 (a) applies. \n \n \nThere is evidence that five people had access to the hotel room where the \nmarijuana was found in August 2008: Applicant, her three friends, and the stranger \nApplicant brought to the room. The marijuana and paraphernalia were found in three \nlocations within the room. Applicant credibly testified that she did not use marijuana, \ntaking her parental responsibilities seriously. There is doubt that Applicant knew what \nwas happening because she was intoxicated that night and she fell asleep rapidly. It \nstrains belief that Applicant would place marijuana around the hotel room where it could \nbe found so easily by the cleaning staff. The other four people, who were in the room at \nvarious times, had an equal opportunity to place the marijuana in the room. Applicant \nand one of her friends pled no contest to the charges, so the culpability is divided at \nleast two ways. AG \u00b6 32 (c) applies because there is credible evidence Applicant may \nnot have brought the marijuana into the room. \n \n \nApplicant has not committed the same type of offense or any other criminal \noffense since August 2008. She seemed contrite and admitted her mistake at the \nhearing. She has a good employment record as shown by the character statement from \nher employer. AG \u00b6 32 (d) applies. \n  \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement \n \n \nAG \u00b6 24 expresses the security concern pertaining to illegal drugs: \n \nUse of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because it may \nimpair judgment and because it raises questions about a person's ability \nor willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \n \n \n(a) Drugs are defined as mood and behavior altering substances, and include: \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \n(1) Drugs, materials, and other chemical compounds identified and listed \nin the Controlled Substances Act of 1970, as amended (e.g., marijuana or \ncannabis, depressants, narcotics, stimulants, and hallucinogens), and \n \n(2) inhalants and other similar substances; \n \n(b) drug abuse is the illegal use of a drug or use of a legal drug in a \nmanner that deviates from approved medical direction. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 25 describes eight conditions that could raise a security concern and may \nbe disqualifying. Only one condition applies: \n \n(c) illegal drug possession, including cultivation, processing, manufacture, \npurchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of drug paraphernalia; \n \n \nApplicant was charged with possession of less than 100 grams of marijuana and \nparaphernalia. She pled no contest to the charges because she could not afford an \nattorney.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 26 provides four conditions that could mitigate security concerns. Two \nconditions apply: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \nand \n \n(b) a demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future, such as:  \n \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; and, \n \n(3) an appropriate period of abstinence. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 26 (a) applies for the same reasons stated under the Guideline J, AG \u00b6 32 \n(a) analysis, above. This was a one-time incident in Applicant\u2019s life, and has not been \nrepeated. The fact that she was one of four persons registered in a hotel room where \nmarijuana was found, after she and her friends were out swimming all day, does not \ncast doubt on Applicant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 26 (b) applies because Applicant has demonstrated an intent not to be \nplaced in this type of situation again by not associating with these three other women \nagain, not taking such weekend trips and associating with strange men she meets in \nbars on these weekends, and dedicating herself to her son and her job. She admitted \nthat she needs to devote her time and energies to these tasks as a single mother. There \n\n \n7 \n \n \nis also no evidence that she ever used marijuana in August 2008 or afterwards. No tests \nwere conducted then or later. Applicant was in the vicinity of marijuana along with four \nother people who could have possessed it without Applicant knowing about it.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of an applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \nAG \u00b6 2 requires each case must be judged on its own merits.  Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the \nultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance must be an \noverall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines and \nthe whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant was about 29 years old \nwhen this incident occurred. She made the decision to return to her hotel room with a \nstranger who had an equal chance with Applicant\u2019s three roommates to put marijuana in \nthe hotel room. It was a one-time occurrence by Applicant. She has not repeated the \nconduct. Her employer knows about the incident so the potential for pressure, coercion, \nexploitation, or duress is very slight. There is no likelihood of continuation or recurrence \nbased on the totality of Applicant\u2019s life and work history. \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant mitigated the security concerns arising from her criminal conduct \nand drug involvement. I conclude the \u201cwhole-person\u201d concept for Applicant.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n8 \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline J:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline H:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT  \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

Applicant\nrequested a decision on the written record.  On February 26, 2010, after considering the record,\nAdministrative Judge Claude R. Heiny denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.\nApplicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s adverse security\nclearance decision was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  Finding no error, we affirm.\nThe Judge found that Applicant has numerous delinquent debts, for such things as medical\nbills, telephone services, student loans, etc.  Applicant has experienced illness in the recent past and\nis divorced, circumstances which were beyond her control and which affected her financial situation.\nHowever, the Judge noted a paucity of record evidence addressing many of the questions arising\nfrom her case, for example corroboration for her claims that (1) certain debts were not legitimately\nhers and (2) she had paid certain debts.  The Judge also noted that the record contained no evidence\nthat Applicant had received counseling or that she had her debts under control.  Accordingly, he\nconcluded that Applicant had failed to mitigate the security concerns in her case.\nApplicant asserts that she made the unfortunate choice of not requesting an in-person meeting\n(hearing), and that not doing so appears to be the main reason she was denied a clearance.  The Judge\ndid indicate in his decision that he was unable to evaluate Applicant\u2019s demeanor and appearance, and\nwas unable to form a positive determination as to her truthfulness.  However, the Judge also stated\nthat even if he found for her in these matters, there is no evidence of payment on delinquent debts.\nGiving due consideration to this last qualifying statement, the Board concludes that the Judge\u2019s\nultimate adverse security clearance decision was not based on any negative inferences drawn from\nthe mere fact that Applicant elected to have her case considered on the written record.  Considering\nthe record and the Judge\u2019s decision as a whole, the Board concludes that the Judge\u2019s decision is\nsustainable based on objective evidence of Applicant\u2019s delinquent debt history and her inability to\nmake significant progress in resolving her financial difficulties.  Applicant has not established error\non the part of the Judge.\nAfter reviewing the record, the Board concludes that the Judge examined the relevant data\nand articulated a satisfactory explanation for the decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between\nthe facts found and the choice made.\u2019\u201d  Motor Vehicle Mfrs.

These eleven debts total $7,755. She denied the remaining factual allegations. Applicant\u2019s admissions to the SOR allegations are incorporated herein. After a thorough review of the record, pleadings, and exhibits, I make the following findings of fact: Applicant is a 51-year-old security officer who has worked for a defense contractor since June 2008, and is seeking to obtain a security clearance. Applicant asserts her financial problems started in 1993 when she was taking care of her two daughters2, her sick mother, and stepfather. Her stepfather died in 2000 after a four-year illness. In 2000, Applicant was laid-off from her job at a counseling center. In September 2003, she was unemployed for three months following her relocation to a new city. From May 2003 through July 2008, her pay was $9 per hour. In June 2008, she obtained her current job which pays $12 per hour. In December 2008, she suffered a heart attack and her medications are expensive. Applicant\u2019s credit bureau reports (CBR) (Items 10 and 11) list six medical debts in SOR paragraphs: 1.a ($42), 1.b ($36), 1.c ($34), 1.d ($900), 1.f ($371), and 1.x ($647).

DeLaney, Esquire, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro Se \n \n \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nHEINY, Claude R., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant was alleged to owe approximately 24 accounts that have been \ncharged-off or placed for collection, which total approximately $13,000. She admits \nowing 11 debts, which total approximately $7,700. The delinquent debts remain unpaid. \nApplicant failed to rebut or mitigate the government\u2019s security concerns under financial \nconsiderations. Clearance is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \n \nApplicant contests the Defense Department\u2019s intent to deny her eligibility for an \nindustrial security clearance. Acting under the relevant Executive Order and DoD \nDirective,1 the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of \n                                                          \n1 Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, \n1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative \n  \n 1\nFebruary 26, 2010\n\nReasons (SOR) on August 11, 2009, detailing security concerns under guideline F, \nfinancial considerations. \n  \n \nOn September 19, 2009, Applicant answered the SOR and elected to have the \nmatter decided without a hearing. Department Counsel submitted the government's \ncase in a File of Relevant Material (FORM), dated December 10, 2009. The FORM \ncontained 11 attachments. On December 16, 2009, Applicant received a copy of the \nFORM, along with notice of her opportunity to file objections and submit material to \nrefute, extenuate, or mitigate the potentially disqualifying conditions.  \n \nOn January 15, 2010, Applicant responded to the FORM. Department Counsel \ndid not object to the response. Applicant's response was admitted into the record. On \nJanuary 29, 2010, I was assigned the case.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR, she admitted the factual allegations, with \nexplanations, in \u00b6\u00b6 1.e, 1.f, 1.h, 1.j, 1.k, 1.o, 1.q, 1.r, 1.t, 1.u. and 1.w. These eleven \ndebts total $7,755. She denied the remaining factual allegations. Applicant\u2019s admissions \nto the SOR allegations are incorporated herein. After a thorough review of the record, \npleadings, and exhibits, I make the following findings of fact: \n \n \nApplicant is a 51-year-old security officer who has worked for a defense \ncontractor since June 2008, and is seeking to obtain a security clearance.  \n \n \nApplicant asserts her financial problems started in 1993 when she was taking \ncare of her two daughters2, her sick mother, and stepfather. Her stepfather died in 2000 \nafter a four-year illness. In 2000, Applicant was laid-off from her job at a counseling \ncenter. In September 2003, she was unemployed for three months following her \nrelocation to a new city. From May 2003 through July 2008, her pay was $9 per hour. In \nJune 2008, she obtained her current job which pays $12 per hour.  \n \n \nIn December 2008, she suffered a heart attack and her medications are \nexpensive. Applicant\u2019s credit bureau reports (CBR) (Items 10 and 11) list six medical \ndebts in SOR paragraphs: 1.a ($42), 1.b ($36), 1.c ($34), 1.d ($900), 1.f ($371), and 1.x \n($647).  \n \n \nApplicant denies owing a $1,173 telephone debt (SOR \u00b6 1.q), which a collection \nagency is attempting to collect. Applicant\u2019s cell phone was stolen in 2003. She reported \nthe theft to the service provider and they said they would investigate the matter. \nApplicant then forgot about the matter. As of September 2008, Applicant had been \nadvised she was $1,349 delinquent on the account. (Item 8) \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                           \nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the \nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n2 Her daughters are now age 25 and 31.  \n  \n 2\n\n \nIn March 2009, Applicant contacted a debt solution company. (Item 9) The plan \nlists $10 per month payments on each of eight debts, which totaled $2,322, for a total \nmonthly payment of $80. Those SOR debts are: 1.c ($34), 1.f ($371), 1.j ($189), 1.k \n($373), 1.n ($751), 1.o ($236), 1.q ($48), and 1.r ($320). Applicant failed to show she \nmade any payments to the debt solution company. \n  \n \nIn September 2009, Applicant again contacted the debt solution company. The \narrangement listed four of the SOR debts and two duplicate accounts, which totaled \n$1,723. Those SOR four debts are: 1.f ($371), 1.j ($189), 1.o ($236), and 1.r ($320). \nThe two duplicate accounts are: 1.f ($371) and 1.o ($236). Applicant did not explain why \nthe duplicate accounts were listed as debts to be paid. The agreement required \nApplicant to pay the debt solutions company $75 monthly on these debts.  \n \n \nAs of March 25, 2009, the creditor of the student loan was holding a postdated \ncheck in the amount of $64. (Item 9) There is no evidence this check was honored or \nthat any additional payment was made on this loan. Applicant asserts, but failed to \nprovide documentation, that she is paying $64 monthly on her student loans. The SOR \nlists two student loan debts: 1.l ($38) and 1.w ($4,973).  \n \nApplicant has cut back on or eliminated things in order to pay her bills. She did \nnot learn she was divorced until 1997 or 1998, when her ex-husband and he told her he \nhad divorced her years earlier. (Answer to FORM) \n \nIn September 2008, Applicant was questioned about her unpaid debt during a \npersonal interview. (Item 8) In March 2009 and May 2009, Applicant answered \ninterrogatories concerning her unpaid debt. In March 2009, a debt of $19.18 was paid \nby an offset from her state income tax refund. (Answer to SOR) Applicant did not \nindicate which SOR debt related to this payment. Additionally, a $35.74 check was sent \nto another creditor not listed in the SOR. These are the only documented payments \npresented. \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which must be considered \nin evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \n  \n 3\n\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion for obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to \npotential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \n \nRevised Adjudicative Guideline (AG) \u00b6 18 articulates the security concerns \nrelating to financial problems: \n \nFailure or inability to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds. \n \n  \n 4\n\nAdditionally, an individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, negligent, or careless in properly handling and \nsafeguarding classified information. Behaving responsibly or irresponsibly in one aspect \nof life provides an indication of how a person may behave in other aspects of life.  \n \nA person\u2019s relationship with her creditors is a private matter until evidence is \nuncovered demonstrating an inability or unwillingness to repay debts as agreed. Absent \nsubstantial evidence of extenuating or mitigating circumstances, an applicant with a \nhistory of serious or recurring financial difficulties is in a position of risk that is \ninconsistent with holding a security clearance. An applicant is not required to be debt \nfree, but is required to manage her finances so as to meet her financial obligations. \n \n \nThe record evidence supports a conclusion Applicant has a history of financial \nproblems, by her admission, which started in 1993. Seven of Applicant\u2019s debts were \napproximately $100 or less. Throughout this process, she had admitted responsibility for \neleven delinquent debs, totaling about $7,700. She has provided insufficient \ndocumentation to show significant progress resolving her debts. The government \nestablished the disqualifying conditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c). \n \n \nFive Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions under AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a) \u2013 (e) are \npotentially applicable: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control; \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; or \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 20(a), Applicant=s financial problems started in 1993, but continue to \nremain a problem. She has numerous delinquent debts, some less than $100 each, that \n  \n 5\n\nremain unpaid. The debt was not incurred under unusual circumstances. AG \u00b6 20(a) \ndoes not apply.  \n \nUnder AG & 20(b), Applicant was divorced sometime during the 1990s and was \nunemployed for three months in 2003. These are certainly problems largely beyond her \ncontrol, however the divorce occurred more than ten years ago and the unemployment \nmore than six years ago. Her mother had been ill, and in December 2008, Applicant had \na heart attack. Again, these are conditions beyond her control. The financial impact of \nher mother\u2019s illness and her heart attack is unknown except for her comment that her \nmedication is rather expensive. AG & 20(b) has limited applicability. \n \nUnder AG & 20(c) there is no indication that Applicant has received counseling or \nthat her financial problems are under control. Under AG & 20(d), there is no showing \nApplicant has paid any of the SOR debts or entered into an agreement making payment \non her debts. In March 2009, she contacted a debt management company, but there is \nno evidence she made any payments to her creditors as a result of that contact. In \nSeptember 2009, she again contacted the company, but she has not provided any \nevidence she has made payments following that contact. She did provide evidence that \nin March 2009, the creditor holding her student loan obligation was in possession of a \n$64 postdated check. There is no evidence of any additional payment to that creditor. \nAG & 20(c) and & 20(d) do not apply. \n \nApplicant has denied some of the debts. Specifically, she says her cell phone \nwas stolen in 2003 and she informed the service provider of the theft. They investigated \nand Applicant owes the money. For AG & 20(e) to apply not only is there a need for a \nreasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-due debts, but she must provide \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provide evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. Simply stating the debt is not owed is insufficient for this mitigating \nfactor to apply.  \n \nThe debts listed in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.u ($489) and 1.v ($574) are duplicated debts. Not \nonly are both obligations owed to the same creditor, although the account numbers \ndiffer, the payment history on these two debts is identical. Applicant admits the one \nobligation and denies the other. The debt listed in SOR \u00b6 1.l ($38) is a student loan, \nwhich would be included in the larger $4,973 student loan amount (SOR \u00b6 1.l). \nAdditionally, the debt listed in SOR \u00b6 1.l ($189) is a collection company collecting for the \ntelephone company listed in SOR \u00b6 1.l ($189). I find the debts listed in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.j, 1.l, \nand 1.v to be duplicate debts. I find for Applicant as to these three debts. Her unpaid \ndebt raises concerns about her current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.  \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n  \n 6\n\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.  \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. The debts incurred were not the \ntype that indicates poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules \nand regulations. Money was not spent frivolously. It is noted that six of the debts were \nfor medical treatment. \n \nBecause Applicant chose to have this matter handled administratively, I am \nunable to evaluate her demeanor, appearance, or form a positive determination as to \nher truthfulness. From the record, I am unable to find Applicant was sincere, open, and \nhonest. Even if I found for her in these matters, there is no evidence of payment on the \ndelinquent debts.  \n \nOf course, the issue is not simply whether all her debts are paid or are being \npaid, which they are not\u2014it is whether her financial circumstances raise concerns about \nher fitness to hold a security clearance. (See AG & 2(a)(1).) The amount of debt is not \nlarge. The amount alleged was $13,000 and she admits to owing $7,700. However, \nnone of the delinquent debt has been paid. It is noted that seven of the debts, \napproximately one-third of the total number of her debts, are for debts of less than $100 \neach. Even the small debts have not been addressed.  \n \nThis decision should not be construed as a determination that Applicant cannot \nor will not attain the state of true reform and rehabilitation necessary to justify the award \nof a security clearance. The awarding of a security clearance is not a once in a lifetime \noccurrence, but is based on applying the factors, both disqualifying and mitigating, to \nthe evidence presented. Under the Applicant=s current circumstances, a clearance is not \nrecommended. Should the Applicant be afforded an opportunity to reapply for a security \nclearance in the future, having paid the delinquent obligations, established compliance \nwith a repayment plan, or otherwise addressed the obligations, she may well \ndemonstrate persuasive evidence of her security worthiness.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \n  \n 7\n\n  \n 8\nconclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns arising from her financial \nconsiderations.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Financial Considerations: AGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a -1.i: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.j:  \n \nFor Applicant  \n \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.k:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.l:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.m- 1.u: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.v:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.w and 1.x: \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.  \n \n \n_____________________ \nCLAUDE R. HEINY II \nAdministrative Judge \n \n \n \n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact The government alleged in the SOR that Applicant owes approximately $31,694 in delinquent debt for an unpaid medical bill ($960) placed for collection in March 2007 (SOR \u00b6 1.a); for a past due second mortgage account ($1,984) (SOR \u00b6 1.b); for a delinquent credit card account ($28,708) referred for collection (SOR \u00b6 1.c); and an unpaid medical bill ($42) for treatment received in March 2007 (SOR \u00b6 1.d). Applicant denied SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.d, claiming both were paid or otherwise resolved. Ax. B supports his claim that SOR \u00b6 1.a was being resolved through his medical insurance (see also Tr. 34 - 35, 79), and Department Counsel acknowledged that one of the credit reports in evidence (Gx. 2) showed the debt alleged at SOR \u00b6 1.d has been paid. (Tr. 12, 79) Applicant denied SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.c on the basis that they are disputed debts. In addition to the facts established through the pleadings, I make the following findings of relevant fact. Applicant is 59 years old and holds a bachelor,s degree in computer science. He was a self-employed software engineer with his own small information technology business from about June 1998 until June 2008, when his business, which had been struggling for most of the preceding two years, failed. At that time, he hired on with his current employer, a large defense contractor.

After reviewing the results of the ensuing background\ninvestigation, adjudicators for the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nwere unable to make a preliminary affirmative finding  that it is clearly consistent with\n1\nthe national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s request for a clearance. On February 25, 2009,\nDOHA issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging facts which raise\nNovember 9, 2009\n\n The revised Adjudicative Guidelines were approved by the President on December 29, 2005, and were\n2\nimplemented by the Department of Defense on September 1, 2006.

(Tr.\n12, 79) Applicant denied SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.c on the basis that they are disputed debts.\nIn addition to the facts established through the pleadings, I make the following findings\nof relevant fact.\nApplicant is 59 years old and holds a bachelor,s degree in computer science. He\nwas a self-employed software engineer with his own small information technology\nbusiness from about June 1998 until June 2008, when his business, which had been\nstruggling for most of the preceding two years, failed. At that time, he hired on with his\ncurrent employer, a large defense contractor. (Answer; Gx. 1; Tr. 22) Applicant asserts\nhe had excellent credit, and that his business was successful and provided him with a\ncomfortable income until about 2006 or 2007. It was also around that time his mother\nbecame ill and required full-time care. Applicant\u2019s brother actually cared for their\n\n3\nmother, but Applicant provided substantial financial support. Unfortunately, when his\nbusiness began to fail, Applicant found himself overextended financially. (Answer; Tr. 21\n- 23)\nAt times, Applicant was able to make as much as $30,000 in a single month from\nhis business. Generally, he chose to put the money back into the business and send\nmoney to his brother for care of their mother. He usually sent him about $7,000 each\nmonth. However, by the summer of 2007, the business would not support Applicant and\nallow him to help his mother to the same extent. The business is still active and\nprovides him about $1,000 each month in addition to the $6,200 he nets each month\nfrom his current job. Since he started working for his current employer, Applicant\nestimates he has about $4,000 remaining each month after expenses, including a $300\nmonthly payment to his mother\u2019s care. (Answer; Tr. 37 - 39, 50, 70 - 71)\nApplicant has lived in the same condominium since about 2000. He has two\nmortgages on that property. Around September 2007, he began having trouble paying\nhis bills and, by May 2008, foreclosure proceedings had begun. Applicant was able to\nresolve the past due payments on his first mortgage, but, as alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b, he\nstill owes at least $1,984 for missed payments on his second mortgage, which has a\nbalance of about $72,000. (Gx. 3) At the hearing, it was determined that Applicant has\nnot made any payments on the second mortgage since late 2007. (Tr. 59) He testified\nthat he has been trying to resolve his second mortgage for more than a year, that he is\ndisputing the actual amount he owes on that obligation, and that he has submitted\ndocuments several times as requested by the mortgage company, only to be repeatedly\nfrustrated by the bank\u2019s procedures and non-responsiveness. (Answer; Tr. 23 - 26)\nApplicant further averred that he could provide post-hearing documentation of his\nclaims, but provided only an incomplete letter from the creditor who now holds the\naccount. (Ax. C) That letter and Applicant\u2019s forwarding letter provided no new support\nfor Applicant\u2019s claimed dispute with this creditor.\nIn 2001, Applicant took a cash advance of $45,000 against one of his credit\ncards. He used the money to buy a boat. Credit reports (Gx. 2 and Gx. 3) show that\nApplicant still owes about $28,708 on this debt, as alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.c. Applicant\ndenies he is obligated to pay this debt. He insists that between 12 and 24 months after\nhe took this advance, the credit card rates were increased from 10.9% to at least 25%.\nApplicant\u2019s position is that he no longer owes anything to the credit card company,\nbecause they violated the terms of their original agreement. When asked if the rates\nwere increased because he had missed payments, he stated only that it was possible\nhe may have missed one or two payments.  (Answer; Tr. 29 - 32, 42 - 43, 66 - 68)\nApplicant hired an attorney to help negotiate with the creditors in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and\n1.c. He has had no success resolving either obligation through counsel. (Answer; Ax.\nA). However, in December 2008, Applicant was offered a chance to settle the SOR \u00b6\n1.c debt for $4,000. Despite having a significant positive cash flow at the time, he did\nnot act on the offer, choosing instead to ask the creditor to send his attorney a copy of a\nproposed agreement for legal review. (Tr. 30 - 32) Applicant has not otherwise acted on\nthe debt and still questions whether he should have to pay even $4,000 to resolve it.\n\n Directive. 6.3.\n6\n See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988).\n7\n See Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, 531.\n8\n4\n(Tr. 73) Despite claiming at hearing that he can document his dispute with the SOR \u00b6\n1.c creditor, he made no post-hearing submission regarding that debt.\nPolicies\nEach security clearance decision must be a fair, impartial, and commonsense\ndetermination based on examination of all available relevant and material information,6\nand consideration of the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in the Revised\nAdjudicative Guidelines (AG). Decisions must also reflect consideration of the factors\nlisted in \u00b6 2(a) of the new guidelines. Commonly referred to as the \u201cwhole person\u201d\nconcept, those factors are:\n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nThe presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not\ndeterminative of a conclusion for or against an applicant. However, specific applicable\nguidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against them as they\nrepresent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to classified\ninformation. In this case, the pleadings and the information presented by the parties\nrequire consideration of the security concerns and adjudicative factors addressed under\nAG \u00b6 18 (Guideline F - Financial Considerations).\nA security clearance decision is intended to resolve whether it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest  for an applicant to either receive or continue to\n7\nhave access to classified information. The government bears the initial burden of\nproducing admissible information on which it based the preliminary decision to deny or\nrevoke a security clearance for an applicant. Additionally, the government must be able\nto prove controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If the government meets its burden, it\nthen falls to the applicant to refute, extenuate or mitigate the government\u2019s case.\nBecause no one has a \u201cright\u201d to a security clearance, an applicant bears a heavy\nburden of persuasion.  A person who has access to classified information enters into a\n8\nfiduciary relationship with the government based on trust and confidence. Thus, the\ngovernment has a compelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the\nrequisite judgment, reliability and trustworthiness of one who will protect the national\ninterests as his or her own. The \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard\n\n See Egan; Revised Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 2(b).\n9\n Directive, E3.1.14.\n10\n Directive, E3.1.15.\n11\n5\ncompels resolution of any reasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in\nfavor of the government.9\nAnalysis\nFinancial Considerations\nThe security concern about Applicant\u2019s finances, as stated in AG \u00b6 18, is that: \n[f]ailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.\nAvailable information shows the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.d have been\npaid or otherwise resolved. However, Applicant denied that he owes the debts alleged in\nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.c, which total about $30,692. Accordingly, the burden remained with\nthe government to prove those allegations.  The record evidence (the government\u2019s\n10\nexhibits and Applicant\u2019s testimony at the hearing) is sufficient to show that Applicant still\nowes those debts. Also, it was learned at hearing that the Applicant has not made any\npayments on his second mortgage, which has a balance of at least $72,000, since the\nlast quarter of 2007. This makes it likely that the SOR \u00b6 1.b debt is actually larger than\nalleged. Both debts have been delinquent since at least September 2007, and there is\nno record of payment or other action to resolve either debt. The foregoing requires\napplication of the disqualifying conditions listed at AG \u00b6 19(a) (inability or unwillingness\nto satisfy debts) and AG \u00b6 19(c) (a history of not meeting financial obligations).\nThe government proved the controverted facts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.c,\nand those facts raise security concerns under Guideline F. As a result, the burden\nshifted to the Applicant to present information sufficient to refute the allegations, or to\nmitigate the security concerns raised.  Because Applicant\u2019s debts remain unpaid, his\n11\nfinancial problems must be viewed as recent. While it may be that the circumstances\nleading to his problems are not likely to recur, because, as discussed below, his\nresponse to his financial problems has been insufficient, questions remain about his\njudgment. Thus, available information precludes application of the mitigating condition at\nAG \u00b6 20(a) (the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under\nsuch circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's\ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment). \n\n See footnote 6, supra.\n12\n6\nThere is no record of financial counseling or other outside assistance, and he has\nnot shown that he has made any payments on either debt. Thus, the mitigating\nconditions at AG \u00b6 20(c) (the person has received or is receiving counseling for the\nproblem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under\ncontrol) and AG \u00b6 20(d) (the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue\ncreditors or otherwise resolve debts) do not apply.\nIt is not controverted that Applicant\u2019s financial problems resulted, in part, from the\nfailure of his business and from the need to support his ailing mother. These facts\nrequire consideration of the mitigating condition at AG \u00b6 20(b) (the conditions that\nresulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person's control (e.g. loss of\nemployment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce\nor separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances). However,\nthis adjudicative factor can apply only if Applicant acted responsibly under the\ncircumstances. I conclude he has not done so. As to SOR \u00b6 1.b, a debt for missed\npayments totaling less than $2,000, he has had the means to pay this off since late\n2008. Also bearing on this issue is the fact that, in 2007, he stopped paying anything to\nthe second mortgage, likely exacerbating his financial problems to an extent not\nidentified through his background investigation. As to SOR \u00b6 1.c, Applicant testified that\nhe was offered a chance to settle a $28,000 debt for $4,000 in December 2004. His\nrefusal to take advantage of that offer was ill-advised, to say the least. \nApplicant\u2019s denial of both SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.c was also based on his claimed\ndisputes with both creditors. His response requires consideration of the mitigating\ncondition at AG \u00b6 20(e) (the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy\nof the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented proof\nto substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions to resolve the\nissue). I conclude this does not apply. Applicant was provided extra time after the\nhearing to present documents to support his claims, yet the documentation presented in\nhis post-hearing submission (Ax. C) has no persuasive value in the face of the\ngovernment\u2019s information. On balance, I conclude Applicant has failed to mitigate the\nsecurity concerns raised by the government\u2019s information about his finances.\nWhole Person Concept\nI have evaluated the facts presented and have applied the appropriate\nadjudicative factors under Guideline F. I have also reviewed the record before me in the\ncontext of the whole person factors listed in AG \u00b6 2(a). Applicant is 59 years old, and\nwas a successful businessman for nearly 10 years. However, despite the fact his\nfinancial problems since 2007 were due to circumstances beyond his control, there is\ninsufficient positive information about Applicant\u2019s judgment to overcome the adverse\ninferences to be drawn from his inadequate response to his financial problems. His\nexplanations for his inaction were not plausible, and available information shows that his\nfinancial difficulties are unlikely to change in the near future. These facts and\ncircumstances present an unacceptable risk were he to be granted access to classified\ninformation. A fair and commonsense assessment  of all available information about\n12\n\n See footnote 9, supra. \n13\n7\nthe Applicant\u2019s background shows there are still doubts about his ability or willingness to\nprotect the government\u2019s interests as his own. Because protection of the national\ninterest is paramount in these determinations, such doubts must be resolved for the\ngovernment.13\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by section\nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the foregoing, it is not clearly consistent with the national interest\nto grant Applicant\u2019s request for access to classified information.

On April 7, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals \n(DOHA) issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns \nunder Guideline F (Financial Considerations). The action was taken under Executive \nOrder 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), \nas amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nrevised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, \n2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September \n1, 2006.  \n  \nAugust 28, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n \n \nOn April 27, 2009, Applicant answered the SOR in writing and elected to have \nthe case decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. On May 27, 2009, \nDepartment Counsel prepared a File of Relevant Material (FORM) containing nine Items \nand mailed Applicant a complete copy the following day. Applicant received the FORM \non June 3, 2009, and had 30 days from its receipt to file objections and submit \nadditional information. On June 24, 2009, Applicant submitted exhibits to which \nDepartment Counsel had no objection. On July 24, 2009, DOHA assigned the case to \nme. After receiving the file, I marked Applicant\u2019s Exhibits as AE 1 through 15 and \nentered them into the record. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the factual allegations contained in \nParagraph 1.a and denied those contained in Paragraphs 1.b through 1.e and offered \nexplanations.   \n  \n \nApplicant is 49 years old and married to his second wife. He has two children and \ntwo-step children with his former wife from whom he was divorced in 1999. Since \nSeptember 2004, he has worked as a technician for a federal contractor. Before this \nposition, he worked in private industry from January 2003 to September 2004. He was \nunemployed from September 2002 to January 2003.  (Item 4) \n \n \nIn his Answer, Applicant attributed his financial difficulties to a difficult divorce \nand subsequent custody suit, his relocation to another area to care for his dying mother, \nand a period of unemployment and underemployment. (Item 2)  \n \n \n \nApplicant and his wife sought credit counseling in February 2004 and entered \ninto an agreement with a debt management company to resolve seven debts, a couple \nwhich are listed in the SOR. (AE 6) He later sought credit counseling through another \nservice which recommended that he file bankruptcy, which he did not want to do. (AE 2)  \n \n \nBased on a credit bureau reports (CBR), dated July 2008, February 2009, and \nMay 2009, the SOR alleged five delinquent debts, totaling about $41,000, which began \naccruing in 2003. The status of the debts is as follows: \n \n \n1. SOR \u00b6 1.a alleges a $6,035 debt owed to a credit card company that \npurchased the debt from another credit card company. In June 2009, \nApplicant negotiated a repayment plan. He will make $208 monthly payments \nbeginning at the end of July 2009.  (AE 2 )  \n \n2. SOR \u00b6 1.b alleges a $12,870 debt owed to a company that purchased the \ndebt from a credit card company. This debt was resolved for $7,863 and paid \nin August 2008. (AE  2, 8, 9, 10)  \n \n3. SOR \u00b6 1.c alleges a $1,679 debt owed to a credit card company that \npurchased it from another credit card company. The original balance was \n\n \n3 \n \n \n$4,198, and Applicant settled the debt for $2,518 on January 3, 2006. The \ndifference of $1,679 was erroneously reported to the CBR and has been \nremoved from Applicant\u2019s most recent June 2009 CBR. This debt is resolved. \n(AE 2, 3, 11, 12) \n \n4. SOR \u00b6 1.d alleges a $12,964 debt owed to a credit card company. In June \n2006, Applicant negotiated a $10,000 settlement of the debt and agreed to \nmake $100 monthly payments. Per that agreement, the balance is now \n$5,700.  This debt is resolved by an installment payment program. (AE 2, 13, \n14, 15)  \n \n5. SOR \u00b6 1.e alleges a $7,436 debt owed to the same creditor listed in \u00b6 1.b \nabove. It is being resolved through payments beginning in July 2009. (AE 2, \n3)  \n \n \nIn summary, Applicant resolved the five debts. He paid two of them and is \nmaking monthly payments on the $11,700 outstanding balance for the remaining two \ndebts, one of which is listed twice on the SOR.   \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. According to Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \n\n \n4 \n \n \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions adverse to an \napplicant shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also Executive Order \n12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive \ninformation). \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concerns relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations are \nset out in AG & 18:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \n AG & 19 sets forth nine conditions that could raise security concerns, two of \nwhich are potentially disqualifying in this case:  \n \n(a) an inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts;  and \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \nBased on the CBRs and his statements, Applicant began accumulating a \nsignificant amount of debt in 2003 that he did not begin to resolve until mid-2005, some \nof which remains outstanding today. The evidence is sufficient to raise these two \ndisqualifying conditions.  \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \nAfter the Government raised potential disqualifications, the burden shifted to \nApplicant to rebut and prove mitigation of the resulting security concerns. AG \u00b6 20 sets \nforth six conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising from financial \ndifficulties, three of which may be applicable: \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control; and, \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts. \n \nBeginning in 2003, Applicant encountered circumstances that were beyond his \ncontrol and resulted in a significant amount of debt, viz., a divorce, unemployment and \nunderemployment, and care giving for his mother. There is evidence that in 2004 he \nsought credit counseling and established a repayment plan for some creditors listed on \nthe SOR. Since then, he has paid two debts, and the other three (one of which is a \nduplicate) are being resolved and paid by installment payment plans. He demonstrated \na good-faith effort to pay or resolve the debts and there is a clear indication that the \nproblems are under control. His actions are sufficient to trigger the application of AG & \n20(b), AG & 20(c) and AG & 20(d).  \n  \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a). They include the following:  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n\n \n6 \n \n \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is a 49-year-old man, who \nencountered a series of personal and economic setbacks beginning in 2003. Beginning \nin 2004, he has taken significant steps to address the resulting delinquent debt and \nmanage his finances, demonstrating reliability and good judgment. The SOR listed \napproximately $41,000 in delinquent debt, of which he has resolved about $30,000. \nBased on his awareness of the effect that future financial delinquencies could have on \nhis employment, I do not believe similar problems will recur and that he will make his \ninstallment payments as agreed. There is no other adverse information in the record \nthat raises a security concern. Overall, the record evidence leaves me without doubts as \nto Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude \nApplicant \nmitigated \nthe \nsecurity \nconcerns \narising \nunder \nfinancial \nconsiderations.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a to 1.e:  \nFor Applicant \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance.

The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified\nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense\nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program\n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG)\npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the\nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nOn April 11, 2009, Applicant replied to the SOR (RSOR) in writing, and requested\na hearing before an Administrative Judge. I received the case assignment on April 23,\n2009. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on June 10, 2009, and I convened the hearing\nas scheduled on August 13, 2009, in Las Vegas, Nevada. The Government offered\nExhibits 1 through 7, which were received without objection. Applicant testified on his\nown behalf and submitted Exhibits A through J, which were also admitted without\nobjection. Applicant had one additional witness, his wife, testify on his behalf.  DOHA\nreceived the transcript of the hearing (Tr) on August 20, 2009. Based upon a review of\n\n2\nthe case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified\ninformation is denied.\nFindings of Fact\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nIn his RSOR, Applicant admitted all of the SOR allegations; 1.a. through 1.g. The\nadmitted allegations are incorporated herein as findings of fact. \nAfter a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, including\nApplicant's RSOR, the admitted documents, and the testimony of Applicant and his wife,\nand upon due consideration of that evidence, I make the additional findings of fact: \nApplicant is 50 years old. He is married and has two children. Applicant is\nemployed by a defense contractor, and he seeks a DoD security clearance in\nconnection with his employment in the defense sector.\nThe SOR lists 7 allegations (1.a. through 1.g.) regarding financial difficulties\nunder Adjudicative Guideline F, for overdue debts. The debts will be discussed in the\nsame order as they were listed in the SOR:\n1.a. This overdue debt to Creditor 1 is cited in the SOR in the amount of $867,\nwith an approximate balance of $6,308.  During his testimony, Applicant initially alleged\nthat he was paying $300 to $400 a month on this debt and he was not sure the current\namount now owed (Tr at 29-31). When his wife, who had better knowledge of the status\nof their debts, testified, she indicated that they had not made any payment on this debt,\nas the interest rate had risen to 30% (Tr at 59-60).\n1.b. This second overdue debt to Creditor 1 is cited in the SOR in the amount of\n$292, with an approximate balance of $2,116. Applicant\u2019s wife also testified that this\ndebt had not been paid (Tr at 59-60). \n1.c. This third overdue debt to Creditor 1 is cited in the SOR in the amount of\n$1,206, with an approximate balance of $7,383. Applicant\u2019s wife testified that this debt\nhad not been paid either (Tr at 59-60). \n1.d. This overdue debt to Creditor 2 is cited in the SOR in the amount of $1,035,\nwith an approximate balance of $6,870. Applicant\u2019s wife testified that this debt had not\nbeen paid, as the interest rate has risen to 27% (Tr at 62).\n \n1.e. This overdue debt to Creditor 3 is cited in the SOR in the amount of $169,\nwith an approximate balance of $4,435.  Applicant\u2019s wife testified that they were only two\nor three months behind on this debt (Tr at 62).\n1.f. This overdue debt to Creditor 4 is cited in the SOR in the amount of $5,966,\nwith a total balance of $172,572.  Applicant testified that this debt is for a mortgage for\n\n3\nan investment property that he owned, and which has now been foreclosed. He still owes\nthe entire amount stated in the SOR (Tr at 37).\n1.g. This overdue debt to Creditor 5 is cited in the SOR in the amount of\n$100,172.  Applicant testified that this debt is for a mortgage for another investment\nproperty that he owned, and which has also been foreclosed. He still owes the entire\namount stated in the SOR (Tr at 37-38).\nApplicant testified that his financial difficulties began primarily after 2001, when his\nincome increased to six figures, and he bought investment properties, and as he\ndescribed \u201ctoys\u201d such as motorcycles and an RV (Tr at 39).  In May 2008, he lost the\nemployment that had given him the income. Additionally, the deaths of his mother and\nhis wife\u2019s mother caused further financial difficulties. Finally, his wife was in an\nautomobile accident that further damaged their finances, and the renters of their\ninvestment properties stopped making payments.  He testified that before May of 2008,\nhe was current on all of his bills (Tr at 42). At one point, Applicant owned five investment\nproperties, but he now only owns one. Two of the foreclosed properties were listed on\nthe SOR as 1.f., and 1.g., and the other two properties, not listed on the SOR, have also\nnow gone into foreclosure. He testified that the mortgages on those were approximately\n$110,000 on one, and $80,000 or $90,000 on the other one (Tr at 54). \nApplicant testified that, at this point, he is considering filing bankruptcy, but thus\nfar he has not gone forward with bankruptcy proceedings, because he did not want it to\nhurt his potential to receive a security clearance (Tr at 45-47). He and his wife have tried\nto increase their income and to reduce their expenses. He also did consult a credit\ncounselor, but they could not help Applicant (Tr at 49-50) (Exhibit D). Finally, Applicant\ntestified that he is up to date with his other current bills (Tr at 52-53).\nMitigation\nApplicant submitted several positive documents including: a letter from a friend\nand associate of Applicant, who described him as \u201creliable, trustworthy and of the\nhighest character\u201d (Exhibit G), a Certificate of Appreciation for Applicant for his\n\u201cdedication, guidance and assistance\u201d from his current employer (Exhibit I), and a\nPerformance Evaluation for July 2008 to July 2009 (Exhibit J) from his current employer,\nwith an overall rating of 3.3.out of 4. \nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\n\n4\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c),\nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the\n\u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable\ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a\ndecision.   \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to classified\ninformation will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have\ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the evidence\ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere\nspeculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or\nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship\ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government\nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk\nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified\ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as\nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set\nout in AG \u00b6 18:  \n      Failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\n\n5\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns.  Under\nAG \u00b6 19 (a), \u201can inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts\u201d is potentially disqualifying.\nSimilarly under AG \u00b6  19 (c), \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d may raise\nsecurity concerns. Applicant accumulated significant delinquent debt and has been\nunable to pay his obligations for a considerable period of time. The evidence is sufficient\nto raise these potentially disqualifying conditions, requiring a closer examination.\nUnder AG \u00b6  20 (b), it may be mitigating where \u201cthe conditions that resulted in the\nfinancial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a\nbusiness downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation),\nand the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.\u201d As noted above,\nApplicant\u2019s financial problems were largely because of his loss of employment. However,\nthere were other reasons that contributed to his overdue debts, including his\noverspending on many items, and the inability to manage or sell his investment property.\nHe also has been unable to make any serious attempt to resolve his overdue debts.\nTherefore, I do not find that this potentially mitigating condition is a factor for\nconsideration in this case. \n Applicant has not resolved his very significant debt. I conclude that until he is\nable to significantly reduce this debt, and establish a more stable financial picture, he\nhas not mitigated the financial concerns of the Government.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and\nmaturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which participation is voluntary; (6)\nthe presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7)\nthe motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d Under AG \u00b6 2 (c), the\nultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance must be an\noverall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines and\nthe whole person concept.      \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the\nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. Based on all of the reasons cited above\nas to why the Disqualifying Conditions apply and why no Mitigating Condition  applies, I\nfind that the record evidence leaves me with significant  questions and doubts as to\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance under the whole person\n\n6\nconcept. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the security\nconcerns. \nFormal Findings\n        Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as\nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.g.:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\n       In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n                                              \nMartin H. Mogul\nAdministrative Judge\n",

He denied the SOR allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 2.a and 2.b (HE 3). His admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence of record, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant is a 38-year-old employee of a government contractor who is seeking a security clearance (Tr. 6-7). He married in 2000, and his divorce was final in 2008 (Tr. 32, 56). He has an eight-year-old son; however, he is not required to pay child support because he is underemployed (Tr. 33-34). The family court will establish his child support requirement after he is re-employed (Tr. 33-34). He has the equivalent of an associate\u2019s degree in political science (Tr. 7, 33).

After he returned from Afghanistan, he discovered an employee had defrauded his business in 2004 (Tr. 22-23).3 The employee created a \u201cshell company\u201d and forged Applicant\u2019s signature on loan documents (AE C). The employee defrauded Applicant and banks or mortgage companies of hundreds of thousands of dollars (AE C).

In 1987, Applicant\u2019s father brought \nhim to the United States, and in 2002, he became a U.S. citizen. His son, father, sister \nand brother are U.S. citizens. Applicant returned to Afghanistan, and assisted U.S. \ncombat forces as a translator and liaison for six months. An Army Lieutenant Colonel \nwho worked with Applicant in Afghanistan lauded his duty performance, bravery, and \ncontributions to mission accomplishment. Applicant wishes to return to Afghanistan as a \ntranslator. He has significantly greater contacts with the United States than with \nAfghanistan. He can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of U.S. \ninterests.  \n \nIn January 2008, Applicant became unemployed due to the decline in his \nmortgage and real estate business. He was the victim of a massive fraud. He was \nunable to pay seven debts listed in the statement of reasons (SOR); however, he acted \nresponsibly under the circumstances. He credibly promised to pay his delinquent debts \nwhen he receives adequate employment. Foreign influence and financial considerations \nsecurity concerns are mitigated.

On May 8, \n2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of \nReasons (SOR) to him, alleging security concerns under Guidelines F (Financial \nConsiderations) and B (Foreign Influence) (Hearing Exhibit (HE) 2). The action was \ntaken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \n(February 20, 1990), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the \nPresident on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for \nSORs issued after September 1, 2006. The SOR detailed reasons why DOHA could not \nmake the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for him, and \nrecommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a clearance \nshould be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. \n \nOn May 20, 2009, Applicant responded to the SOR and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge (HE 3). On June 16, 2009, Department Counsel was \nprepared to proceed. On June 19, 2009, DOHA assigned the case to me. On July 8, \n2009, DOHA issued a hearing notice (HE 1). On August 11, 2009, the hearing was held. \nAt the hearing, Department Counsel offered five exhibits (GE 1-5) (Transcript (Tr.) 28), \nand Applicant offered eight documents (AE A-H)1 and one book (AE I) (Tr. 22-31). \nThere were no objections, and I admitted GE 1-5 and AE A-I (Tr. 26-31). I received the \ntranscript on August 19, 2009. On September 4, 2009, Department Counsel forwarded \nsix additional exhibits she received from Applicant (AE J-O). There were no objections \n(HE 5), and I admitted AE J-O.   \n \nProcedural Ruling \n \nDepartment Counsel requested administrative notice (AN) of facts concerning \nAfghanistan (Tr. 31; HE 4, AN Request). Department Counsel provided supporting \ndocuments to show detail and context for these facts (HE 4, Ex. I to VIII). Applicant did \nnot object, and I granted Department Counsel\u2019s request (Tr. 31). \n \nAdministrative or official notice is the appropriate type of notice used for \nadministrative proceedings. See ISCR Case No. 05-11292 at 4 n.1 (App. Bd. Apr. 12, \n2007); ISCR Case No. 02-24875 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2006) (citing ISCR Case No. \n02-18668 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 10, 2004) and McLeod v. Immigration and Naturalization  \nService, 802 F.2d 89, 93 n.4 (3d Cir. 1986)). Usually administrative notice at ISCR \nproceedings is accorded to facts that are either well known or from government reports. \nSee Stein, ADMINISTRATIVE LAW, Section 25.01 (Bender & Co. 2006) (listing fifteen types \nof facts for administrative notice).  \n \n1 At the hearing, Applicant\u2019s exhibits were pre-marked AE A with Attachments 1-7 (Tr. 20-23).  \nAfter the hearing I re-marked them as AE A-H. \n  \n\n \n3 \n                                                                                                                                             \n                                           \nFindings of Fact2 \n \nApplicant\u2019s response to the SOR admitted the allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a to 1.j, and 2.c \nto 2.g (HE 3). He denied the SOR allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 2.a and 2.b (HE 3). His admissions \nare incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a complete and thorough review of the \nevidence of record, I make the following findings of fact. \n \nApplicant is a 38-year-old employee of a government contractor who is seeking a \nsecurity clearance (Tr. 6-7). He married in 2000, and his divorce was final in 2008 (Tr. \n32, 56). He has an eight-year-old son; however, he is not required to pay child support \nbecause he is underemployed (Tr. 33-34). The family court will establish his child \nsupport requirement after he is re-employed (Tr. 33-34). He has the equivalent of an \nassociate\u2019s degree in political science (Tr. 7, 33).  \n \nFinancial Considerations \n \nFrom September 2002 to December 2007, Applicant was self-employed in the \nmortgage and banking industry (Tr. 21-22, 35-36; GE 1). Applicant went to Afghanistan \nfor about six months in 2004 to 2005 (Tr. 22). After he returned from Afghanistan, he \ndiscovered an employee had defrauded his business in 2004 (Tr. 22-23).3 The \nemployee created a \u201cshell company\u201d and forged Applicant\u2019s signature on loan \ndocuments (AE C). The employee defrauded Applicant and banks or mortgage \ncompanies of hundreds of thousands of dollars (AE C). \n \nApplicant spent tens of thousands of dollars attempting to resolve the allegations \nof fraud (Tr. 22). The employee who committed the thefts and forgeries was indicted, \nand Applicant is listed as the victim of the forgery in one of the counts of the indictment \n(Tr. 22; AE C). An August 5, 2009, letter from a deputy district attorney (DDA) indicates \nApplicant is the victim of forgery and his cooperation and assistance resulted in the \nfelony conviction of the perpetrator (AE C).4 During the course of mediation, the \nemployee who defrauded Applicant accepted responsibility for one of the debts \ngenerated during the fraud (Tr. 80-81; AE L). The DDA suggested that Applicant use the \nfraud conviction to obtain judgments against the person who defrauded him for any \ndebts generated by the fraud (Tr. 81).  \n \n \n2The facts in this decision do not specifically describe employment, names of witnesses, names \nof other groups or locations in order to protect Applicant and his family\u2019s privacy. The cited sources \ncontain more specific information. Applicant\u2019s opening statement was admitted as an exhibit and as \nsubstantive evidence (Tr. 27). \n \n3The indictment indicates one theft of mortgage-related funds occurred September 23-30, 2004 \n(AE C). \n \n4Department Counsel agreed with Applicant that Applicant was exonerated from a mortgage-\nfraud allegation, and credited him with continuing to work with the district attorney\u2019s office to bring the \ncriminals to justice (Tr. 18). \n \n\n \n4 \n                                                                                                                                             \nApplicant\u2019s mortgage and real estate business was barely breaking even in 2006 \nand throughout 2007 (Tr. 35-36). He was unemployed starting in December 2007. He \ndecided to seek employment as a translator and cultural advisor in January 2008 (GE \n1). After he learned his security clearance was not being approved in December 2008 or \nJanuary 2009, he obtained employment earning $500 a month by taking care of elderly \npersons at their homes (Tr. 24, 34-35). He lives with a relative and pays monthly rent of \n$300 (Tr. 71).  \n \nApplicant\u2019s SOR debts \n \nApplicant\u2019s SOR listed ten delinquent debts totaling $64,418 as follows: \u00b6 1.a \n(judgment\u2014$7,610); \u00b6 1.b (tax lien\u2014$3,230); \u00b6 1.c (collection account\u2014$474); \u00b6 1.d \n(collection account\u2014$269); \u00b6 1.e (collection account\u2014$166); \u00b6 1.f (repossession\u2014\n$34,000); \u00b6 1.g (2007 judgment for fraud\u2014$17,500); \u00b6 1.h (collection account\u2014$171); \u00b6 \n1.i (collection account\u2014$599); and \u00b6 1.j (collection account\u2014$399). His SOR response \n(HE 3) admitted all debts. \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.a (judgment\u2014$7,610)\u2014UNRESOLVED. Applicant admitted he was \nresponsible for this debt in his SOR response (HE 3; GE 3). The judgment was filed in \nNovember 2006 (GE 2 at 28). At the hearing, he said he was unfamiliar with this debt \n(GE 3).  \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.b (tax lien\u2014$3,230)\u2014PAYMENT PLAN. Applicant owed the state \ntaxing authority $3,230 (Tr. 42; SOR \u00b6 1.b). On March 30, 2008, he promised to pay the \nstate $100 per month (AE F at 1, 4). He did not make any payments to the state \nbecause of underemployment and unemployment (Tr. 43-44).   \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.c (collection account\u2014$474)\u2014PAID. On March 11, 2008, he paid the \ncreditor in SOR \u00b6 1.c $377 (Tr. 44-45; AE D at 10-12). The creditor responded that he \nstill owed $11 to the creditor (Tr. 44-45; AE D at 10-12).  \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.d (collection account\u2014$269)\u2014PAID. Applicant listed the debt in SOR \n\u00b6 1.d ($269) on his SF-86 at Section 28, Item 6 (GE 1; GE 2 at 24). On March 21, 2008, \nhe paid the last $151 owed on this account, and the creditor indicated the account was \npaid (Tr. 45-46; AE D at 15; AE N).   \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.e (collection account\u2014$166)\u2014PAYMENT PLAN. Applicant was \nunable to pay the debt because of unemployment (Tr. 46). \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.f (repossession\u2014$34,000)\u2014SETTLEMENT PROPOSED. Applicant \nborrowed $43,000 to purchase a Toyota in June 2005 (GE 2 at 14). The monthly \npayment was $943 (GE 2 at 14). He made his last payment in November 2007, and his \nvehicle was repossessed (GE 2 at 14). Applicant disputed the amount of the debt (GE 2 \nat 27; GE 3 at 9). The creditor offered to settle the debt for $17,000; however, Applicant \nwas unable to pay the debt due to unemployment (Tr. 48).  \n \n\n \n5 \n                                                                                                                                             \nSOR \u00b6 1.g (2007 judgment for fraud\u2014$17,500)\u2014DISPUTED. The employee \nwho defrauded Applicant has taken responsibility for paying off one debt; however, he \nhas not actually paid it (Tr. 48-49, 80-81; AE C; AE L). The debt he agreed to pay is not \nnecessarily the debt is SOR \u00b6 1.g.  \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.h (collection account\u2014$171)\u2014UNRESOLVED. Applicant admitted he \nwas responsible for this debt in his SOR response (HE 3; GE 3). A February 21, 2008, \ncredit report listed this debt as \u201cdisputed under reinvestigation\u201d (GE 3 at 5). At his \nhearing, Applicant said he was unfamiliar with this debt (Tr. 53-55; GE 3).  \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.i (collection account\u2014$599)\u2014UNRESOLVED. Applicant admitted he \nwas responsible for this debt in his SOR response (HE 3; GE 3). A February 21, 2008, \ncredit report shows the last act on account was in February 2008, and the account was \ntransferred to the collection company from a bank (GE 3 at 8-9). At his hearing, \nApplicant said he was unfamiliar with this debt (Tr. 55; GE 3).  \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.j (collection account\u2014$399)\u2014PAID. On November 13, 2007, \nApplicant paid the $399 telecommunications debt (Tr. 55; AE D at 4; Section 28, Item 3, \nSF-86; SOR \u00b6 1.j).  \n \nNon-SOR debts. Applicant paid a debt of $427 on April 9, 2008 (AE D at 3; GE \n1, Section 28, Item 8, SF-86). On March 25, 2008, he paid a $910 debt (AE D at 5; GE \n1, Section 28, Item 10, SF-86; AE D at 5). On March 27, 2008, he paid a $637 debt (AE \nD at 6, 7). On March 24, 2008, Applicant satisfied a debt to the collection company he \nlisted in his SF-86, Section 28, Item 1 as being owed $474 (GE 1; AE D at 14, 16). \n \nFederal income taxes. In 2002, Applicant\u2019s adjusted gross income was $13,850 \n(AE M). He had nothing withheld from his taxes, and the amount owed, if any, was not \nlisted on his tax return (AE M). In 2003, Applicant\u2019s adjusted gross income was $35,922 \n(AE M). He had nothing withheld from his taxes, and owed $4,706 (AE M). In 2004, \nApplicant\u2019s adjusted gross income was $41,749 (AE M). He had nothing withheld from \nhis taxes, and owed $4,882 (AE M). In 2005, Applicant\u2019s adjusted gross income was \n$77,954 (AE M). He had $1,150 withheld from his taxes, and owed $6,036 (AE M). In \n2006, Applicant\u2019s adjusted gross income was $70,680 (AE M). He had $674 withheld \nfrom his taxes, and owed $5,384 (AE M). In 2007, Applicant listed no income on his tax \nreturn (AE M). For tax year 2008, he provided a Form 4868, Application for Automatic \nExtension of Time to File U.S. Individual Income Tax Return for 2008, with zero \nindicated in estimated tax liability and total 2008 payments to the IRS (AE M).  \n \nOn March 2, 2007, the IRS released an IRS tax lien for tax year 2002 amounting \nto $8,162 (AE F at 5). Applicant submitted the release of the 2002 IRS tax lien to \ndemonstrate that he has paid off large obligations in the past (Tr. 44). \n \nApplicant owed the Internal Revenue Service for tax years 2003, 2004, and 2005 \n(AE F at 3-5). The IRS accepted his offer to pay $380 monthly starting June 1, 2008 (AE \nD at 3). Applicant did not provide documentation showing how much he owed the IRS \n\n \n6 \n                                                                                                                                             \nfor tax years 2003 to 2005. Applicant did not indicate he made any payments under this \nagreement, and I presume he has not made any payments because of lack of income. \n \nOther financial information. Applicant had a credit card with a limit of $500, \nwhich was current as of March 11, 2008 (AE D at 9, 13). Applicant corresponded with \nthe credit reporting companies to ensure their reports did not list the debts of his \nrelatives (Tr. 23; AE E).  \n \nApplicant promised to pay his debts (Tr. 72). He offered to have funds withheld \nfrom his salary or to have his clearance automatically revoked if he fails to pay his \ncreditors as promised (Tr. 25). He offered to work for the U.S. government without a \nsalary until his debts are paid (Tr. 73). He was confident that he could resolve all of his \ndebts in one year, or perhaps much sooner, if he receives employment as a translator \n(Tr. 43, 72). He expected his annual salary, if hired as a translator in Afghanistan, to be \nabout $210,000 (Tr. 72).  \n \nIn August 2009, Applicant received some financial counseling and generated a \nbudget (Tr. 80; AE K). The budget only addressed his situation while receiving a \nmonthly gross income of $500. He was well aware of financial issues through his \nexperiences in the mortgage business (Tr. 79-80). \n \nOn February 22, 2008, Equifax reported the creditor holding the account in SOR \n\u00b6 1.h was not reporting and some other accounts were listed as disputed (AE E at 7, 9). \nOn March 21, 2008, Applicant disputed the presence of four debts on his credit report, \nincluding the accounts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.i and 1.j (AE E). The February 21, 2008, credit \nreport listed disputes and investigations in progress for SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d (GE 3 at 6), 1.e (GE \n3 at 8), 1.f (GE 3 at 9), and 1.h (GE 3 at 5).   \n \nForeign Influence \n \nIn 1979, Applicant\u2019s father was part of the resistance in Pakistan that opposed \nthe Soviet Union\u2019s occupation of Afghanistan (Tr. 20). The U.S. Government funded his \nefforts and due to his role in the resistance he became well known in Afghanistan (Tr. \n20). As a teenager, Applicant lived in a refugee camp in Pakistan (Tr. 20). Applicant \nassisted in the war to expel the Soviets by making trips into Afghanistan, and by \ninterviewing Afghan and Soviet prisoners (Tr. 20). In 1987, Applicant\u2019s cousin was \nkidnapped and others in the same profession as Applicant\u2019s father were assassinated \n(Tr. 20). Applicant\u2019s father sought asylum in the United States and Applicant moved to \nthe United States with his father (Tr. 21; GE 1).  \n \nApplicant lived in the United States from 1987 to 1993 (Tr. 21). He attended high \nschool in the United States and participated in the U.S. political process (Tr. 21). \nApplicant\u2019s family left the United States and Applicant\u2019s father worked in an Afghan \nembassy as a consultant (Tr. 21). In 1996, Applicant returned to the United States and \nworked in the mortgage banking industry (Tr. 21).   \n \n\n \n7 \n                                                                                                                                             \nIn 2002, Applicant became a U.S. citizen (GE 1). His father returned to \nAfghanistan and was appointed to a high-level position in the Afghan national \ngovernment (Tr. 22). In 2004, Applicant went to Afghanistan for his grandmother\u2019s burial \n(Tr. 38). For the six months Applicant stayed in Afghanistan (2004-2005), he was a \nvoluntary liaison between the Afghan Government and a U.S. Army base (Tr. 22, 39). \nHe worked closely with the U.S. Marines and U.S. Army Special Forces (Tr. 22). He \nacted as a linguist and advisor to the U.S. Army concerning the Pashtun tribal system, \nlocal culture, and customs in one of the most dangerous provinces in Afghanistan (Tr. \n22, 67). In this role, he provided assistance to his father, who was an important Afghan \nGovernment Official (AGO), and to the U.S. Army (Tr. 39). Although there was always \ndanger from explosives and mines, Applicant was not personally threatened or \nharassed by the Taliban (Tr. 67).  \n \nA U.S. Army Lieutenant Colonel (LTC T), who is a Special Operations Officer, \nlauded Applicant\u2019s assistance to LTC T\u2019s Provincial Reconstruction Team (AE C).  \nApplicant helped with construction and development projects and on security issues (Tr. \n69). LTC T emphasized Applicant\u2019s honesty, intelligence, focus, and compassion (AE \nC). LTC T noted that Applicant \u201cbrave[d] the violence [which was] necessary to gain the \ntrust of local people who has been abandoned by everyone else. [Applicant] is a \ncourageous and honorable young man who has a genuine passion for doing good. And, \nhe is that rare man who has taken the action necessary, at great personal sacrifice, to \nactually get up and do that good for a great many people.  .  .  .\u201d (AE C at 1-2).      \n \nSOR foreign influence allegations. SOR \u00b6 2.a alleges Applicant\u2019s spouse is a \ncitizen of Afghanistan, who resides in the United States as a registered alien. He \nbecame divorced in 2008 (Tr. 32, 56). He does not stay in contact with his former \nspouse\u2019s family living in Afghanistan (Tr. 57). \n \nSOR \u00b6 2.b alleges Applicant\u2019s sister is a citizen of Afghanistan, who resides in \nthe United States as a registered alien. His sister was born in Afghanistan, became a \nU.S. citizen in 2008, and now lives in the United States (Tr. 57; GE 1).  \n \nSOR \u00b6 2.c alleges that Applicant has extended family members who are citizens \nof Afghanistan and who reside in Afghanistan. Applicant has an uncle who is serving \nwith the U.S. Army as a contract linguist in Afghanistan (Tr. 58). His uncle is a U.S. \ncitizen (Tr. 58). Applicant\u2019s brother is a U.S. citizen, who lives in Afghanistan (Tr. 59, \n74). His brother lives in the Afghan capital and works on research projects and as a \nsecurity analyst for private firms (Tr. 70). His brother also works closely with an agency \nthat is under U.S. State Department supervision (Tr. 70, 89-90). His brother has not \nbeen threatened and is not protected by a security detail (Tr. 70). Although Applicant is \nin regular contact with his brother, he has not talked to his uncle in about two years (Tr. \n59-60).  \n \nSOR \u00b6 2.d alleges that Applicant has friends who are citizens and residents of \nAfghanistan. Applicant has some acquaintances in Afghanistan from his visit in 2004; \nhowever, he does not maintain contact with them (Tr. 59). His relationship with the \n\n \n8 \n                                                                                                                                             \n                                           \nacquaintances living in Afghanistan is not close, and he did not maintain any friendships \nwith citizens and residents of Afghanistan over the last five years. \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.e and 2.f allege that Applicant\u2019s father is a close personal friend of an \nimportant AGO (Tr. 59). His father has known the AGO for at least 20 years (Tr. 60). \nWhen his father lived in Pakistan, his father had frequent contact with the AGO, and \nthey were part of the resistance effort against the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan (Tr. \n60). From 1993 to 1996, Applicant\u2019s father was an employee of Afghanistan in an \nembassy located outside of the United States and Afghanistan (Tr. 61). Applicant and \nthe AGO have been good friends for many years and remain good friends (Tr. 61). After \nApplicant\u2019s father returned to Afghanistan in 2002, the AGO appointed him to two \nimportant Afghan Government positions (Tr. 63-64). Applicant\u2019s father was very pro-\nUnited States, and because of that support he was targeted or threatened by terrorists \nor the Taliban (Tr. 68). \n \nIn 2006, Applicant\u2019s father resigned from his Afghan Government position and \nreturned to the United States because he needed heart and eye surgeries (Tr. 64). The \nlast time Applicant\u2019s father went to Afghanistan was in 2008, and he stayed there for six \nto nine months (Tr. 65). His father went to Afghanistan to visit family and friends and not \nto work for the Afghan Government (Tr. 65). Applicant\u2019s father introduced Applicant to \nmany important Afghan Government officials when Applicant was in Afghanistan; \nhowever, Applicant did not maintain contact with them after he left Afghanistan (Tr. 66). \nApplicant\u2019s father may return to Afghanistan if his health improves (Tr. 74). \n \n \nIn sum, Applicant\u2019s mother, father, and one sister were born in Afghanistan, and \nall of them became U.S. citizens and live in the United States (GE 1). One of his sisters \nwas born in Russia, became a U.S. citizen and now lives in the United States (GE 1). \nHis brother was born in Pakistan, is a now U.S. citizen, and supports the United States\u2019 \ngoals though his work in Afghanistan. Applicant\u2019s son was born in the United States and \nlives in the United States. \n  \nAfghanistan5 \n \nAfghanistan is a country in Southwestern Asia. It is approximately the size of \nTexas (249,935 square miles). Pakistan borders it on the east and the south. Iran \nborders it on the west and Russia to the north. It is a rugged and mountainous country \nwhich has been fought over by powerful nations for centuries. In 2006, the population \nwas about 31 million people with about 3,000,000 Afghans living outside Afghanistan.  \n \nAfghanistan is presently an Islamic Republic with a democratically elected \npresident. Afghanistan has had a turbulent political history, including an invasion by the \nSoviet Union in 1979. After an accord was reached in 1989, and the Soviet Union \n \n5The facts in the section concerning Afghanistan are from Department Counsel\u2019s factual \nsummary, except for some comments about the relationship between the United States and Afghanistan, \nwhich are from the U.S. Department of State, Background Note: Afghanistan, Nov. 2008 and U.S. \nDepartment of State, Country Specific Information Sheet\u2014Afghanistan, Mar. 4, 2009 (HE 4, enclosures I \nand III). \n\n \n9 \n                                                                                                                                             \nwithdrew from the country, fighting continued among the various ethnic, clan and \nreligious militias. By the end of 1998, the Taliban rose to power and controlled 90% of \nthe country, imposing aggressive and repressive policies.  \n \nIn October 2001, U.S. forces and coalition partners led military operations in the \ncountry, forcing the Taliban out of power by November 2001. The new democratic \ngovernment took power in 2004 after a popular election. Despite that election, terrorists \nincluding al-Qaida and the Taliban continue to assert power and intimidation within the \ncountry. Safety and security are key issues because these terrorist organizations target \nUnited States and Afghan interests by suicide operations, bombings, assassinations, \ncar-jacking, assaults, or hostage taking. At this time, the risk of terrorist activities \nremains extremely high. The country\u2019s human rights record remains poor and violence \nis rampant. According to recent reports from the U.S. Department of State, insurgents \ncontinue to plan attacks and kidnappings of Americans and other Western nationals. \nTravel warnings are ongoing. No section of Afghanistan is safe or immune from \nviolence.  \n \nThe United States supports the efforts of the Afghan Government to establish, \n \na vibrant civil society, one that emphasizes democratic principles through \na rule of law and creates accountable and transparent forms of \ngovernment. The United States and its international partners remain \ncommitted to helping Afghans realize their vision for a country that is \nstable, democratic, and economically successful, and to an Afghan \nGovernment committed to the protection of women\u2019s rights, human rights, \nand religious tolerance.   \n \nU.S. Department of State, Background Note: Afghanistan, Nov. 2008 (HE 4, enclosure I \nat 13). \n \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the \nExecutive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security \nemphasizing, \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. \nEgan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the \nauthority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine \nwhether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. \nat 527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.    \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not \ninflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \n\n \n10 \n                                                                                                                                             \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  \n \nThe government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. Clearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. \nOr. 10865 \u00a7 7. See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), Section 3. Thus, \nnothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, \nin whole or in part, on any express or implied determination as to applicant\u2019s allegiance, \nloyalty, or patriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict \nguidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a \nclearance. \n \nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).      \n \nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of \ndisproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the government. See ISCR Case No. \n02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, \nif they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).   \n \nAnalysis \n \n  \nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all \nappropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, I conclude the relevant security \nconcerns are under Guidelines F (financial considerations) and B (foreign influence) \nwith respect to the allegations set forth in the SOR. \n \n \n \n\n \n11 \n                                                                                                                                             \nFinancial Considerations \n \n  \nAG \u00b6 18 articulates the security concern relating to financial problems: \n \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds. \n  \n  \nAG \u00b6 19 provides two conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \u201c(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts\u201d; and \u201c(c) a \nhistory of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d The Appeal Board has noted, \u201cApplicant\u2019s \ncredit report was sufficient to establish the Government\u2019s prima facie case that \nApplicant had  .  .  .  delinquent [SOR] debts that are of security concern.\u201d ISCR Case \nNo. 03-20327 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006). Applicant\u2019s history of delinquent debt is \ndocumented in his credit reports, his responses to DOHA interrogatories, his SOR \nresponse, and his oral statement at his hearing. He failed to ensure his creditors were \npaid as agreed. The government established the disqualifying conditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) \nand 19(c). Further inquiry about the applicability of mitigating conditions is required.  \n   \n  \nFive mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially applicable:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control; \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \n\n \n12 \n                                                                                                                                             \n                                           \nApplicant\u2019s conduct does not warrant full application of AG \u00b6 20(a) because he \ndid not act more aggressively and responsibly to resolve his delinquent debts. His \ndelinquent debts are \u201ca continuing course of conduct\u201d under the Appeal Board\u2019s \njurisprudence. See ISCR Case No. 07-11814 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 29, 2008) (citing ISCR \nCase No. 01-03695 (App. Bd. Oct. 16, 2002)). He has made insufficient progress paying \nor resolving his seven unpaid SOR debts, which now total about $65,000. However, his \ndelinquent debts do not cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good \njudgment for the reasons in the discussion of AG \u00b6 20(b), infra.  \n \nApplicant receives full mitigating credit under AG \u00b6 20(b) because his financial \nproblems resulted from the decline of his business, the fraudulent activity of an \nemployee, and his unemployment and underemployment in 2008-2009.6 He was \ndivorced in 2008; however, the record did not explain how his divorce exacerbated his \nfinancial problems. He has provided sufficient evidence that he acted responsibly under \nthe circumstances over the last two years.  \n \nThe Appeal Board\u2019s discussion of AG \u00b6 20(b) in ISCR Case No. 08-06567 (App. \nBd. Oct. 29, 2009) clarifies the applicability of this mitigating condition when an \nApplicant is unable to make substantial progress on delinquent debts after \ncircumstances outside an applicant\u2019s control cause delinquent debt.7  In ISCR Case No. \n08-06567 (A.J. July 27, 2009), the applicant had a judgment against him in June 2001 \nfor $7,948; an IRS tax lien in January 2001 for $25,441 from tax years 1993 to 1997 \n(since released), and a state tax lien in September 1999 for $6,701 (since released). \nThese three delinquent debts established a history of financial problems, which included \nsignificant tax problems extending over eight years (1993 to 2001). Id. at 2. In 2007, the \napplicant\u2019s business faltered (the circumstance beyond his control), and he generated \nabout $21,000 in additional delinquent debt. Id. at 3-4. He paid six of his new debts, and \nthree debts totaling about $17,000 remain for resolution. ISCR Case No. 08-06567 at 2 \n(App. Bd. Oct. 29, 2009). He obtained financial counseling, developed a repayment \nplan, and took reasonable actions to effectuate his repayment plan. Id. at 3. The Appeal \nBoard at 3 determined that administrative judge erred when he failed to explain, \n \nwhat he believes that Applicant could or should have done under the \ncircumstances that he has not already done to rectify his poor financial \ncondition, or why the approach taken by Applicant was not \u201cresponsible\u201d in \nlight of his limited circumstances.    \n \n \n6\u201cEven if Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances \noutside his [or her] control, the Judge could still consider whether Applicant has since acted in a \nreasonable manner when dealing with those financial difficulties.\u201d ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. \nBd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 \nat 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). A component is \nwhether the Applicant maintained contact with his or her creditors and attempted to negotiate partial \npayments to keep debts current. \n \n7 A copy of ISCR Case No. 08-06567 (A.J. July 27, 2009) and ISCR Case No. 08-06567 (App. \nBd. Oct. 29, 2009) are attached to the record as HE 5 and 6 for convenience. \n\n \n13 \n                                                                                                                                             \n                                           \nThe Applicant in this case has received financial counseling, generated a budget, \nand in 2007 and 2008 he paid the SOR debts in \u00b6\u00b6 1.c ($474), 1.d ($269), and 1.j \n($399). On March 2, 2007, the IRS released an IRS tax lien for tax year 2002 amounting \nto $8,162. On March 25, 2008, he paid a $910 non-SOR debt. On March 27, 2008, he \npaid a $637 non-SOR debt. On April 9, 2008, Applicant paid a $427 non-SOR debt. \n  \nAG \u00b6 20(c) partially applies. Applicant received financial counseling. He provided \na personal financial statement and started a debt consolidation and repayment plan. He \nworked in the real estate and mortgage business and demonstrated a firm grasp of \nbudgeting, payment plans, and expense reduction. He has managed to live on $500 a \nmonth, demonstrating the financial self-discipline necessary to reduce and resolve his \ndebts. There are not \u201cclear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under \ncontrol\u201d because he still lacks the income to address his delinquent SOR debts. He also \nreceives mitigation under AG \u00b6 20(d) because he established good faith8 in the \nresolution of his SOR debts. He acted with reasonableness, prudence, honesty, and \nadherence to duty or obligation, and he did not use bankruptcy or otherwise seek to \navoid his responsibility to repay his creditors. \n \nAG \u00b6 20(e) does not fully apply. Although Applicant filed some disputes with \ncredit reporting companies, he did not provide documentation showing his basis for the \ndisputes. Moreover, in his SOR response he admitted all SOR debts. He has disputed \nsome amounts of debts (for example, the amount owed on his repossessed vehicle), \nand those disputes are reflected in credit reports and in AE E.   \n \nIn sum, Applicant demonstrated sufficient diligence and effort to either resolve his \ndelinquent debts or to stay current on their status while he seeks full employment. His \ndebts initially resulted from underemployment, then unemployment in the aftermath of \nthe fraudulent activity of one of his employees, and most recently underemployment as \nhe has attempted to living on monthly income of $500. His SOR listed ten delinquent \ndebts totaling $64,418. He paid three debts, and could settle his largest debt of $34,000 \nfor $17,000. He paid other non-SOR debts. I am confident he will keep his promise to \npay his delinquent debts once he receives employment as a translator because of his \n \n8The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a \u201cgood faith\u201d effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts: \n \nIn order to qualify for application of [the \u201cgood faith\u201d mitigating condition], an applicant \nmust present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \nsome other good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant\u2019s debts. The Directive does \nnot define the term \u2018good-faith.\u2019 However, the Board has indicated that the concept of \ngood-faith \u2018requires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, \nprudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.\u2019 Accordingly, an applicant must \ndo more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally available option (such as \nbankruptcy [or statute of limitations]) in order to claim the benefit of [the \u201cgood faith\u201d \nmitigating condition]. \n \n(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd.

Adjudication \nunder this Guideline can and should consider the identity of the foreign \ncountry in which the foreign contact or financial interest is located, \nincluding, but not limited to, such considerations as whether the foreign \ncountry is known to target United States citizens to obtain protected \ninformation and/or is associated with a risk of terrorism. \n \nAG \u00b6 7 indicates two conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n \n(a) contact with a foreign family member, business or professional \nassociate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a \nforeign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign \nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to \nprotect sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s desire to \nhelp a foreign person, group, or country by providing that information. \n \nApplicant and his wife are divorced. AG \u00b6 7(d) (\u201csharing living quarters with a \nperson or persons, regardless of citizenship status, if that relationship creates a \nheightened risk of foreign inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion\u201d) does not \napply because there is no evidence he is living with someone who has foreign contacts.  \n \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a) and 7(b) apply. Applicant, his father, brother, and sister were born in \nAfghanistan. His brother and his uncle are working in Afghanistan. His brother and \nuncle have connections to the United States, which makes them probable targets of \nterrorists and the Taliban, along with thousands of U.S. and coalition armed forces and \ncivilian contractors serving in Afghanistan. His father has a close friend, who is an \nimportant AGO. His father held important Afghan Government positions from 2002 to \n2006. He visited his Afghanistan in 2004-2005 for about six months, and he \ncommunicates frequently with his brother. \n \nAlthough Applicant\u2019s communications with family members living in Afghanistan \nare not particularly frequent, his spouse may have more frequent, non-casual \n\n \n15 \n                                                                                                                                             \ncommunications with family members living in Afghanistan. \u201c[T]here is a rebuttable \npresumption that a person has ties of affection for, or obligation to, the immediate family \nmembers of the person\u2019s spouse.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-03120, 2002 DOHA LEXIS 94 at \n*8 (App. Bd. Feb. 20, 2002). Applicant has not rebutted this presumption. Applicant\u2019s \nrelationship with his brother living in Afghanistan is sufficient to create \u201ca heightened risk \nof foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion.\u201d Applicant\u2019s \nrelationship with his brother creates a potential conflict of interest between Applicant\u2019s \n\u201cobligation to protect sensitive information or technology and [his] desire to help\u201d any \nfamily members who are in Afghanistan. For example, if Applicant\u2019s father should return \nto Afghanistan, Applicant would also be exposed to a risk of coercion through his father.   \n \nThe mere possession of close family ties with a family member living in \nAfghanistan, is not, as a matter of law, disqualifying under Guideline B. However, if an \napplicant has a close relationship with even one relative, living in a foreign country, this \nfactor alone is sufficient to create the potential for foreign influence and could potentially \nresult in the compromise of classified information. See Generally ISCR Case No. 03-\n02382 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 15, 2006); ISCR Case No. 99-0424 (App. Bd. Feb. 8, 2001).  \n \nThe nature of a nation\u2019s government, its relationship with the United States, and \nits human rights record are relevant in assessing the likelihood that an Applicant\u2019s family \nmembers are vulnerable to government coercion or inducement. The risk of coercion, \npersuasion, or duress is significantly greater if the foreign country has an authoritarian \ngovernment, a family member is associated with or dependent upon the government, or \nthe country is known to conduct intelligence collection operations against the United \nStates. The relationship of Afghanistan with the United States, places a significant, but \nnot insurmountable burden of persuasion on Applicant to demonstrate that his \nrelationships with his family members living in Afghanistan do not pose a security risk. \nApplicant should not be placed into a position where he might be forced to choose \nbetween loyalty to the United States and a desire to assist a family member living in \nAfghanistan.  \n \nGuideline B is not limited to countries hostile to the United States. \u201cThe United \nStates has a compelling interest in protecting and safeguarding classified information \nfrom any person, organization, or country that is not authorized to have access to it, \nregardless of whether that person, organization, or country has interests inimical to \nthose of the United States.\u201d ISCR Case No. 02-11570 at 5 (App. Bd. May 19, 2004). \nFurthermore, friendly nations can have profound disagreements with the United States \nover matters they view as important to their vital interests or national security. Finally, \nwe know friendly nations have engaged in espionage against the United States, \nespecially in the economic, scientific, and technical fields. See ISCR Case No. 00-0317, \n2002 DOHA LEXIS 83 at **15-16 (App. Bd. Mar. 29, 2002).  \n \nWhile there is no evidence that intelligence operatives from Afghanistan seek or \nhave sought classified or economic information from or through Applicant or his family, \nnevertheless, it is not possible to rule out such a possibility in the future. International \nterrorist groups are known to conduct intelligence activities as effectively as capable \nstate intelligence services, and Afghanistan has an enormous problem with terrorism. \n\n \n16 \n                                                                                                                                             \nApplicant\u2019s relationship with family members living in Afghanistan creates a potential \nconflict of interest because this relationship is sufficiently close to raise a security \nconcern about his desire to assist family members in Afghanistan by providing sensitive \nor classified information. Department Counsel produced substantial evidence of \nApplicant\u2019s contacts with his brother and father and has raised the issue of potential \nforeign pressure or attempted exploitation. AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a) and 7(b) apply, and further \ninquiry is necessary about potential application of any mitigating conditions.  \n \nAG \u00b6 8 lists six conditions that could mitigate foreign influence security concerns \nincluding: \n \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nU.S.; \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country \nis so minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding \nrelationships and loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected \nto resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest;  \n \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation; \n \n(d) the foreign contacts and activities are on U.S. Government business or \nare approved by the cognizant security authority; \n \n(e) the individual has promptly complied with existing agency \nrequirements regarding the reporting of contacts, requests, or threats from \npersons, groups, or organizations from a foreign country; and \n \n(f) the value or routine nature of the foreign business, financial, or property \ninterests is such that they are unlikely to result in a conflict and could not \nbe used effectively to influence, manipulate, or pressure the individual. \n  \n \n \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 8(a) and 8(c) have limited applicability. Applicant visited Afghanistan in \n2004-2005. Applicant has frequent contact with his brother, who lives in Afghanistan. He \nalso has frequent contacts with his father, who may return to Afghanistan. His father has \na high profile in Afghanistan because of his past important Afghan Government \npositions and relationship to an important AGO. Because of his connections to \nAfghanistan, Applicant is not able to fully meet his burden of showing there is \u201clittle \nlikelihood that [his relationships with his relatives who are Afghanistan citizens] could \ncreate a risk for foreign influence or exploitation.\u201d   \n\n \n17 \n                                                                                                                                             \nAG \u00b6 8(b) fully applies. A key factor in the AG \u00b6 8(b) analysis is Applicant\u2019s \u201cdeep \nand longstanding relationships and loyalties in the U.S.\u201d Applicant has established that \n\u201c[he] can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest.\u201d In \n1987, Applicant\u2019s father emigrated from Pakistan/Afghanistan to the United States to \nseek asylum because of threats to the family\u2019s safety. Applicant attended high school in \nthe United States and became a U.S. citizen in 2002. His son was born in the United \nStates. Most importantly, Applicant has assisted U.S. Armed Forces in Afghanistan, \nwhich is a combat zone.  He has shown his patriotism, loyalty and fidelity to the United \nStates.   \n \nApplicant has strong family connections to the United States. His mother, father, \nand two sisters are all U.S. citizens and live in the United States. His brother was born \nin Pakistan, is a now U.S. citizen, and supports the United States\u2019 goals though his work \nin Afghanistan. Applicant\u2019s son was born in the United States and lives in the United \nStates. \n \nApplicant\u2019s relationship with the United States must be weighed against the \npotential conflict of interest created by his relationships with his father and brother. He \nfrequently communicates with these two family members, and his brother is currently \nliving in Afghanistan. His father was an important Afghan official until 2006, and remains \na friend of an important AGO. There is no evidence, however, that terrorists, criminals, \nthe Afghanistan Government, or those conducting espionage have approached or \nthreatened Applicant or his family in Afghanistan to coerce Applicant or his family for \nclassified or sensitive information. As such, there is a reduced possibility that Applicant \nor Applicant\u2019s family would be specifically selected as targets for improper coercion or \nexploitation. While the government does not have any burden to prove the presence of \nsuch evidence, if such record evidence was present, Applicant would have a heavy \nevidentiary burden to overcome to mitigate foreign influence security concerns.  It is \nimportant to be mindful of the United States\u2019 huge investment of manpower and money \nin Afghanistan, and Applicant, his father and brother have supported U.S. goals and \nobjectives in Afghanistan. His father and brother are potential targets of terrorists and \nthe Taliban for their own activities and support for the United States, and Applicant\u2019s \npotential access to classified information is unlikely to add significantly to the risk they \nface from lawless elements in Afghanistan.  \n \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 8(d), and 8(e) do not apply. The U.S. Government has not encouraged \nApplicant\u2019s involvement with family members living in Afghanistan. Applicant is not \nrequired to report his contacts with family members living in Afghanistan. \n \nAG \u00b6 8(f) partially applies because there is no evidence that Applicant has any \ninterest in property or bank accounts in Afghanistan. However, this mitigating condition \ncan only fully mitigate AG \u00b6 7(e), which provides, \u201ca substantial business, financial, or \nproperty interest in a foreign country, or in any foreign-owned or foreign-operated \nbusiness, which could subject the individual to heightened risk of foreign influence or \nexploitation.\u201d  \n \n\n \n18 \n                                                                                                                                             \n                                           \nIn sum, Applicant\u2019s connections to family living in Afghanistan are less significant \nthan his strong connections to the United States. His connections to the United States \ntaken together are sufficient to fully overcome the foreign influence security concerns \nunder Guideline B.  \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n Under the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole person concept. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guidelines F and B in my whole person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(a) \nwere addressed under this guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \n \nForeign influence \n \nThere are some facts supporting a foreign influence security concern because of \nApplicant\u2019s connections to Afghanistan. Applicant, his brother, sister, and father were \nborn in Afghanistan. His brother currently works in Afghanistan, and his father may \nreturn to Afghanistan. He traveled to Afghanistan in 2004-2005, and frequently \ncommunicates with his father and brother.  His father has a relationship to an important \nAGO and may be appointed to another Afghan Government position in the future.  \n  \nA Guideline B decision concerning Afghanistan must take into consideration the \ngeopolitical situation in Afghanistan, as well as the dangers existing in Afghanistan.9 \nAfghanistan is a very dangerous place because of violence from the Taliban and \nterrorists. The Taliban and terrorists continue to threaten the government of \nAfghanistan, the interests of the United States, U.S. Armed Forces, and those who \ncooperate and assist the United States. Applicant recognizes his work with the U.S. \nArmed Forces will endanger his family living in Afghanistan, and will be personally \ndangerous. The United States and Afghanistan are allies in the war on terrorism, and \n \n9 See ISCR Case No. 04-02630 at 3 (App. Bd. May 23, 2007) (remanding because of insufficient \ndiscussion of geopolitical situation and suggesting expansion of whole person discussion). \n  \n\n \n19 \n                                                                                                                                             \nthe United States is committed to the establishment of a free and independent \ngovernment in Afghanistan. Afghanistan and the United States have close relationships \nin diplomacy and trade.      \n \nThe circumstances tending to support approval of a clearance for Applicant are \nmore significant than the factors weighing towards denial of his clearance. In 1987, \nApplicant\u2019s father brought Applicant to the United States. In 2002, Applicant became a \nU.S. citizen. His son was born in the United States. He has significantly greater contacts \nor connections with the United States than with Afghanistan. Although he has frequent \ncontact with his brother living in Afghanistan, his brother is a U.S. citizen and supports \nU.S. goals in Afghanistan. He does not own property in Afghanistan. When he was \nnaturalized as a U.S. citizen, he swore allegiance to the United States.  \n \nApplicant returned to Afghanistan and served with U.S. Armed Forces as a \nlinguist/translator/cultural advisor for about six months from 2004 to 2005. He voluntarily \nrisked his life as part of his duties on behalf of the U.S. Army and Afghanistan. Reliable \nmilitary personnel serving with him in Afghanistan laud his duty performance and \ncontributions to mission accomplishment. He has put himself in harm\u2019s way, working \nalongside U.S. Armed Forces. He has made contributions to national security, fully \naware of the risks to himself and his family. All these circumstances demonstrate that \nApplicant will recognize, resist, and report any attempts by a foreign power, terrorist \ngroup, or insurgent group at coercion or exploitation. See ISCR Case No. 07-00034 at 2 \n(App. Bd. Feb. 5, 2008). Applicant\u2019s strong connections to the United States and \nespecially to his U.S. family, community and his employment as a translator in a combat \nzone establish \u201csuch deep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in the U.S., [he] \ncan be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest.\u201d See \nDiscussion of AG \u00b6 8(b), supra at pages 16-17. \n \nFinancial considerations \n \nThere are some facts supporting a financial considerations security concern. \nApplicant has seven currently delinquent debts totaling about $65,000. He also owes an \nundetermined amount of money to the IRS, and there may be additional unresolved \ndebts created from his employee\u2019s fraudulent activities.  \n \nThe facts supporting mitigation of the financial considerations security concern \nare sufficient under the whole person concept to warrant approval of his access to \nclassified information. Applicant went to Afghanistan for about six months in 2004-2005. \nWhile he was in Afghanistan, an employee at his banking and real estate business \nforged documents and committed theft. When Applicant returned from Afghanistan his \nreal estate business was beginning a downturn. The combination of a real estate \ndownturn and legal problems from the forgery and theft caused Applicant financial \nproblems. Applicant had a good track record of paying his debts prior to the decline in \nhis business and the legal problems with an employee in 2005. In December 2007, he \nclosed his business and planned to work in Afghanistan as a translator/cultural advisor. \nHe was unemployed throughout 2008, and was divorced in 2008. When his security \nclearance was not approved, he obtained employment for $500 a month as an \n\n \n20 \n                                                                                                                                             \n                                           \nuntrained medical aide. A recession has increased unemployment in his state, and I \ninfer the allegations of fraud surrounding Applicant\u2019s business have made it more \ndifficult for him to obtain employment in the banking and real estate sectors. \n \nApplicant has received financial counseling and generated a budget. He has \nworked in the real estate and mortgage businesses and demonstrated a firm grasp of \nbudgeting, payment plans, and expense reduction. In 2007 and 2008 he paid the SOR \ndebts in \u00b6\u00b6 1.c ($474), 1.d ($269), and 1.j ($399). On March 2, 2007, the IRS released \nan IRS tax lien for tax year 2002, amounting to $8,162. In March and April 2008, he paid \nnon-SOR debts of $910, $637, and $427. He was unable to make any additional \nprogress from April 2008 to the hearing on August 11, 2009, because he lacked the \nincome to pay his debts.  Even though he lacked the income to make any payments, he \nmade payment arrangements with the IRS to pay $380 per month, with the state tax \nauthority to pay $100 per month, and to pay other creditors under various payment \nplans. He could not pay child support; however, he promised to inform the court when \nhe became adequately employed so that he could begin payments. He has done \neverything that he could reasonably and responsibly do to address his financial \nproblems. He has managed to live on very little income (I presume he received \nunemployment compensation), and later on he subsisted on only $500 a month for \nalmost two years. He credibly promised to pay his delinquent debts when he receives \nadequate employment. He offered to have his security clearance automatically revoked \nif he is unable to pay all of his delinquent SOR debts within one year of obtaining \nemployment as a translator/cultural advisor.10 \n \nAfter weighing all the facts and circumstances in this decision, including \nApplicant\u2019s demeanor and sincerity at his hearing, I specifically find his statements to be \ncredible, and I conclude he has carried his burden of mitigating the financial \nconsiderations and foreign influence security concerns. \n \nI take this position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518 (1988), my \u201ccareful consideration of the whole person factors\u201d11 and \nsupporting evidence, my application of the pertinent factors under the Adjudicative \nProcess, all the evidence in this decision, and my interpretation of my responsibilities \nunder the Guidelines. For the reasons stated, I conclude Applicant is eligible for access \nto classified information. \n \n \n10 Of course, the government can re-validate Applicant\u2019s financial status at any time through \ncredit reports, investigation and/or additional interrogatories. Approval of a clearance now does not bar \nthe government from subsequently revoking it, if warranted. Violation of a promise made in a security \ncontext to pay legitimate debts also raises judgment concerns under Guideline E, and may support future \nrevocation of a security clearance. Completion of a security clearance decision documents and \nestablishes a warning to Applicants about the importance of financial responsibility and retention of \ndocumentation about debt resolution. The comments in this footnote do not imply that this clearance is \nconditional.  \n \n11See ISCR Case No. 04-06242 at 2 (App. Bd. June 28, 2006).  \n\n \n21 \n                                                                                                                                             \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline E:    \nFOR APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a to 1.j:  \nFor Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline B:    \nFOR APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a to 2.g: \n For Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

Applicant timely\n2\nanswered the SOR, requesting a hearing. DOHA assigned the case to me 15 March\n2010, and I convened a hearing 13 April 2010. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) 21\nApril 2010.\n \nDecember 21, 210\n\n2\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant denied owing a nearly $51,000 collection account (SOR 1.a.), claiming\nhe had been making regular payments on this account since June 2009. He admitted\nfailing to disclose that his security clearance had been revoked by the U.S. Army in\nMarch 1984 (SOR 2.a.), but claimed that he misread the question. He is a 49-year-old\nsenior program management specialist employed by a defense contractor since August\n2008. He seeks to retain the security clearance he held as needed while in the military\nand on an interim basis until the SOR was issued.\nWhen Applicant applied for an industrial security clearance in September 2008\n(G.E. 1), he answered \u201cno\u201d to a question (26b) asking if he had ever had a clearance\nrevoked. In fact, Applicant had his clearance revoked by the U.S. Army in March 1984,\nwhile he was on active duty. Applicant states (Answer) that he \u201cmisread the question\u201d\nand did not intend to mislead the government because he had \u201cnothing to hide.\u201d\nWhen Applicant\u2019s clearance was revoked in March 1984, he had been in the\nArmy about three years. None of the stated reasons for the revocation are relevant to\nthe issues raised in the SOR. He retired in February 2002 as a Sergeant First Class\n(SFC, paygrade E-7) with over 20 years exemplary service, during which he was\nawarded the Meritorious Service Medal twice, the Army Commendation Medal four\ntimes, the Army Achievement Medal five times, the Good Conduct Medal six times, the\nOverseas Service Ribbon three times, the National Defense Service Medal, and the\nArmy Service Ribbon, among other awards. He has been married over 26 years. His\nwife retired with 20 years military service in 2004.\n \nThe SOR alleges, and Government exhibits confirm, a single collection account\ntotaling nearly $51,000 on defaulted education loans. Applicant states, and\ncorroborates, that he has been making regular bi-monthly payments of $50 since June\n2009 (GE 2; AE A, C, D). The $50 payments were part of a rehabilitation program\nApplicant entered into with the creditor. After nine months of regular payments, the loan\nwas considered rehabilitated and transferred to a regular commercial lender\u2014with a\nhigher loan payment. Applicant made his first $303 payment by automatic debit on 7\nApril 2010 (A.E. C). He has made timely monthly payments since then.\nApplicant\u2019s financial problems began after he retired from the military. He\nexperienced \nunstable \nemployment\u2014including \nperiods \nof \nunemployment \nand\nunderemployment\u2014as well as the financial pressures of having to maintain two\nhouseholds while he and his wife were geographically separated because of their\nrespective job requirements. They fell behind on their bills, including the educational\nloans at SOR 1a. Not until August 2008 did Applicant and his wife both have stable\nemployment, as well as maintaining only one household.\nAt that time, Applicant and his wife began addressing their delinquent accounts.\nThe Government credit reports reflect those efforts, as they show accounts paid and\n\nSee, Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988).\n3\n3\nclosed (sometimes at Applicant\u2019s request, sometimes by the creditor\u2019s action).\nApplicant\u2019s exhibits show many payments to creditors who were not alleged in the SOR.\nIn June 2009, Applicant began a rehabilitation plan with the holder of his\ndefaulted educational loans. The plan required bi-monthly payments of $50 for nine\nmonths. The payment amount was based on a leave and earnings statement (LES) that\nApplicant provided the lender. After Applicant successfully rehabilitated his loans, the\naccount was assigned to a regular commercial lender to resume normal payments.\nApplicant made his first regular payment of $303 per month in April 2010. Applicant also\nhad another set of educational loans that were never delinquent because they were in\ntheir forbearance period. He is current on his monthly payments on this account. The\nforbearance ended in March 2010, and Applicant began monthly payments of $180.\nApplicant and his wife are current on all their accounts, and all their taxes. They\nhave a budget. The loan payments on his educational loans are made by automatic\ndebit.\nPolicies\nThe adjudicative guidelines (AG) list factors for evaluating a person\u2019s suitability\nfor access to classified information. Administrative judges must assess disqualifying and\nmitigating conditions under each issue fairly raised by the facts and situation presented.\nEach decision must also reflect a fair, impartial, and commonsense consideration of the\nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2(a). Any one disqualifying or mitigating condition is not, by itself,\nconclusive. However, specific adjudicative guidelines should be followed where a case\ncan be measured against them, as they represent policy guidance governing access to\nclassified information. Considering the SOR allegations and the evidence as a whole,\nthe relevant adjudicative guidelines are Guideline F (Financial Considerations) and\nGuideline E (Personal Conduct).\nSecurity clearance decisions resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s security clearance. The Government\nmust prove, by substantial evidence, controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If it does,\nthe burden shifts to applicant to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the Government\u2019s case.\nBecause no one has a right to a security clearance, the applicant bears a heavy burden\nof persuasion.\nPersons with access to classified information enter into a fiduciary relationship\nwith the Government based on trust and confidence. Therefore, the Government has a\ncompelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgement,\nreliability, and trustworthiness of those who must protect national interests as their own.\nThe \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any\nreasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the government.3\n\n\u00b6 19.(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; (c) a history of not meeting financial obligations;\n4\nIn the sense that he had other delinquent debts that were resolved before the SOR was issued.\n5\n\u00b6 20 (a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that\n6\nit is  unlikely to recur . . . \n\u00b6 20.(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control . . . and\n7\nthe individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;\n\u00b6 20.(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and there are clear indications\n8\nthat the problem is being resolved or is under control;\n\u00b6 20.(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.\n9\n4\nAnalysis\nThe Government established a case for disqualification under Guideline F, but\nApplicant mitigated the security concerns. Applicant and his wife experienced financial\nproblems after he got out of the military because of his unemployment and\nunderemployment, and having to maintain two households while his wife remained on\nmilitary duty and Applicant took a job in another state.4\nApplicant meets significant mitigating factors for financial considerations. While\nhis financial difficulties are both recent and multiple,  the circumstances under which\n5\nthey occurred are unlikely to recur now that his wife has retired, Applicant and his wife\nboth have stable employment, and they no longer have to maintain two households.6\nFailure to pay the debts was due to circumstances beyond his control, and he acted\nresponsibly in addressing his debts.  As soon as he obtained stable employment, he\n7\nbegan addressing his delinquent debts. The proof of his success is that by the time the\nGovernment issued the SOR, the only delinquent debt to allege was Applicant\u2019s\neducation loan. While there is no evidence that he sought credit counseling, he and his\nwife have a budget, and have otherwise brought the problem under control.  Having\n8\nsubstantially addressed all his delinquent debts\u2014including the debt alleged\u2014before the\nSOR was issued, the timing of the payments constitutes a good-faith effort to satisfy his\ndebts.9\nDepartment Counsel argues that these efforts are somehow inadequate,\nregarding the education loan, because Applicant could have paid more to the creditor\nduring the rehabilitation, but did not volunteer to do so. Applicant testified credibly that\nhe provided the LES required by the creditor, and the creditor\u2019s policy was to set the\nrehabilitation payments at $50 bi-weekly regardless of the debtor\u2019s income. As both the\ncreditor and debtor have an interest in successful rehabilitation of the loan, this policy\nseems more than reasonable. Further, given Applicant\u2019s denial of the financial\nallegation, the Government had the burden of proving the debt and any adverse\ncircumstances surrounding the rehabilitation of the debt. Finally, given Applicant\u2019s clean\nfinancial record while in the military and his speedy resolution of his financial problems\n\n\u00b6 16.(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant and material facts from any personnel\n10\nsecurity questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, . . . [or]\ndetermine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness. . .;\nIn fairness to Department Counsel, the SOR incorrectly alleged the date of revocation as March 2004, and\n11\nshe moved to amend the SOR to reflect the correct date of 1984 (Tr. 11). Nevertheless, her insistence (Tr.\n67-70) that the \u201cfalsification\u201d remained relevant after 24 years because it showed Applicant\u2019s \u201cuntruthfulness,\u201d\ngoes beyond the commonsense decision I am required to make. \n5\nonce he obtained stable employment, there is nothing in the record to suggest that\nApplicant\u2019s financial problems will recur. I conclude Guideline F for Applicant.\nThe Government failed to establish a case for disqualification under Guideline E.\nApplicant credibly testified that his omission was an oversight based on his misreading\nthe question, that he had previously reported the revocation on military clearance\napplications, and consequently he had nothing to hide. Thus, Applicant lacked the\nrequired deliberate intent to mislead the Government.  However, even if Applicant had\n10\nintended to mislead the Government, the amount of time which has passed since the\nrevocation must be considered. A 24-year-old clearance revocation is neither relevant\nnor material to a clearance adjudication, particularly where the issues in that revocation\nare neither relevant or material to the current adjudication.  I resolve Guideline E for\n11\nApplicant.\nFormal Findings\nParagraph 1. Guideline F: \nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph a:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2.

Goldstein, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro se\nJune 17, 2010\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nMOGUL, Martin H., Administrative Judge:\nOn June 16, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under Guideline F for\nApplicant. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified\nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense\nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program\n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG)\npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the\nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nOn July 10, 2009, Applicant replied to the SOR (RSOR) in writing, and he\nrequested a hearing before an Administrative Judge. The case was assigned to this\nAdministrative Judge on August 5, 2009. DOHA initially issued a notice of hearing on\nSeptember 1, 2009, and the hearing was scheduled for September 25, 2009. Because\nApplicant was not available, the hearing had to be continued. DOHA issued a second\nnotice of hearing on October 21, 2009, and I convened the hearing as scheduled on\nDecember 30, 2009, in Las Vegas, Nevada. \n\n2\nAt the hearing, Department Counsel offered Exhibits 1 through 5, which were\nreceived without objection. Applicant testified on his own behalf and submitted Exhibits\nA through K, which were also admitted without objection. DOHA received the transcript\nof the hearing (Tr) on January 7, 2010. Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings,\nexhibits, and the testimony of Applicant, eligibility for access to classified information is\ngranted.\nFindings of Fact\nAfter a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, including\nApplicant's RSOR, the admitted documents, and the testimony of Applicant, and upon\ndue consideration of that evidence, I make the following findings of fact: \nApplicant is 43 years old. He is currently married, and he was married three\nprevious times. Applicant served in the United States Air Force from February 1986 to\nApril 2006, and he held a security clearance for the entire span of his military career.\nApplicant is seeking employment with a defense contractor, and he has applied for a\nDoD security clearance in connection with his employment in the defense sector.\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe SOR lists 5 allegations (1.a. through 1.e.) regarding financial difficulties\nunder Adjudicative Guideline F.  The allegations will be discussed below in the same\norder as they were listed on the SOR:\n1.a. This overdue debt is cited in the SOR in the amount of $206. Applicant\ntestified that this debt was from a collection agency for a credit union in which he\nmaintained a checking account.  Since he was not using the account, he was not aware\nthat this debt had been accumulating fees. He claimed that he called the creditor and\ntold them he was not aware he was receiving charges for this account. They told him\nthey would send him some paperwork to resolve this debt, which he never received. He\ntestified that he was later informed that this creditor no longer has a record of this debt,\nand it has dropped off his credit report. (Tr at 49-50.)\n1.b. This overdue debt is cited in the SOR in the amount of $12,459. Applicant\ntestified that this debt was incurred on a second mortgage, when his ex-wife and her\nhusband at the time purchased a home. According to Applicant this home purchase\noccurred  before he was married to this woman, and he does not know why his name is\non this debt. (Tr at 39-45.)  Applicant was married to this woman form March 1999\nthrough September 3, 2009. (Exhibit H.) He disputed this debt in a letter that he sent to\nthis creditor on December 11, 2009, in which he explained that this debt is not his, and\nthe account should be removed from his credit report. (Exhibit B.) Applicant also sent\nletters to all three credit reporting service, disputing this debt (Exhibits C, D, E), and he\nreceived a letter from Equifax, telling him that this debt was no longer on the Equifax\ncredit file. (Exhibit E.) Exhibit A , a credit report dated December 29, 2009, seems to list\nthis debt several times, but in each listing it shows the amount owed as $0.  Applicant\n\n3\nalso testified that he has called this creditor and he was informed that they do not have\ninformation about him in regards to this debt. (Tr at 69-73.)\n1.c. This overdue debt is cited in the SOR in the amount of $45,600. Applicant\ntestified that this debt was also incurred by his former wife before he was married to her.\nHe claimed that it was listed on Exhibit A and showed that this debt has a $0 balance.\n(Tr at 45-47.) This debt is listed in Exhibit 3, the full data credit report, dated October 9,\n2008, although it shows that it is being disputed. However, it is not listed on the more\nrecent credit report, Exhibit 4, the Government\u2019s credit report dated May 27, 2009, nor is\nit listed on Exhibit A, the credit report dated December 29, 2009. Exhibit C includes a\nletter from one of the credit reporting agencies showing that, after investigating\nApplicant\u2019s dispute of this debt, it is to be deleted from their future credit reports.\nTherefore, Applicant has successfully disputed this debt.\n1.d. This overdue debt is cited in the SOR in the amount of $26,489. Applicant\ntestified that this debt was also incurred by his former wife for a vehicle that she\npurchased for herself. After disputing this bill, Applicant received a letter from the\ncreditor (Exhibit J), stating that they planned to report to the credit bureaus that this\naccount was charged off, with a balance owing. Applicant testified that after he received\nthis letter he called the creditor, and they conceded to him that, since they had no way\nto verify that he had signed for this vehicle, they would drop this account from the credit\nreporting agencies. (Tr at 75-76.) \nApplicant testified that he is not sure of the status of this debt, but he noted that it\nwas not listed on Exhibit A. It is also not listed on Exhibit 4. Applicant further stated that\non previous credit reports this debt had been listed under involuntary repossession, and\nultimately his wife filed for bankruptcy without his knowledge or participation. (Tr at 48-\n52.) \n1.e. This overdue debt is cited in the SOR in the amount of $4,005. Applicant\ntestified that he is unaware of the origin of this debt, and although it was listed on\nExhibit 3,  it had been dropped off the later credit reports. (Tr at 52.) Exhibit K is a letter\ndated November 13, 2008, from a financial institution, which appears to be related to\nthis debt. It informed Applicant that they have notified the appropriate credit reporting\nagencies to remove Applicant\u2019s name from reporting on this account. I note that Exhibit\n3 shows this debt was disputed, and Exhibits 4 and A do not list this debt. \nApplicant conceded that his finances continue to be of concern, since he has\nreceived an offer of employment, but he has not been able to become employed\nbecause he does not hold a security clearance. However, he testified that he is not\noverdue on any current debts. (Tr at 54.) Exhibit A, Applicant\u2019s most recent credit report\nof December 12, 2009, shows that Applicant had no accounts that were listed as past\ndue. \nApplicant submitted his Certificate of Release or Discharge From Active Duty (DD\nForm 214), which confirmed that Applicant served in the United States Air Force from\nFebruary 1986 until March 2006, when he was Honorably Discharged. (Exhibit G.)\n\n4\nAmong the honors received by Applicant were the Air Force Achievement Medal, the Air\nForce Commendation Medal with 3 Oak Leaf Clusters, the Air Forces Expeditionary\nMedal, the NCO Professional Military Education Ribbon,  and many others. \nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c),\nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the\n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable\ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a\ndecision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to classified\ninformation will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have\ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the evidence\ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere\nspeculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or\nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship\ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government\nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk\nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified\ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as\nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\n\n5\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set\nout in AG \u00b6 18:  \n      Failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns and\ncould potentially apply in this case.  Under AG \u00b6 19(a), \u201can inability or unwillingness to\nsatisfy debts\u201d is potentially disqualifying. Similarly under AG \u00b6 19(c), \u201ca history of not\nmeeting financial obligations\u201d may raise security concerns. I find that both of these\ndisqualifying conditions apply to Applicant in this case. The evidence has established\nthat Applicant accumulated significant delinquent debts, primarily by the actions of his\nex-wife, although it is not clear if they were incurred when they were married. \nAG \u00b6 20 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns from financial\ndifficulties: I find that AG \u00b6  20(d) is applicable since Applicant has \u201cinitiated a good-faith\neffort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.\u201d The evidence indicates that\nApplicant acted responsibly to resolve these debts, after he became aware that the debts\nwere incurred by his ex-wife. Since Applicant had a good-faith reason to challenge the\ndebts, he formally sent letters to the creditors and the credit reporting agencies disputing\nthe debts. He also followed up with telephone calls to any of the creditors, whose phone\nnumbers were listed on the credit reports, trying to explain his basis for disputing the\nbills. \nSince Applicant challenged these bills for specific good-faith reasons, and the\nlater credit reports do not list any of the debts from the SOR as overdue, it appears that\nApplicant has successfully disputed each of them. Therefore, I find that this mitigating\ncondition is a factor for consideration in this case. Applicant is current on all of his recent\ndebts. Therefore, I conclude that Applicant has mitigated the financial concerns of the\nGovernment.\n\n6\nWhole-Person Concept\nUnder the whole-person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a\nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.      \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the\nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. Based on all of the reasons cited above\nas to why the Mitigating Condition applies, together with the consideration that Applicant\nserved this country honorably and with distinction for 20 years in the United States Air\nForce, I find that the record evidence leaves me with no significant questions or doubts\nas to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance under the whole-person\nconcept. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant has mitigated the security concerns.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as\nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a. - 1.e.:\nFor Applicant\n\n7\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.\n                                              \nMartin H. Mogul\nAdministrative Judge\n",

    "summary": "findings of fact: Following a heated argument, Applicant shot and wounded a friend who had begun dating the mother of Applicant\u2019s child. Applicant was charged with, and convicted of, felony attempted murder and one count of wearing or carrying a handgun. Eight other charges were nolle prosequi. Applicant was sentenced to thirty years in prison, but the sentence was reduced to fifteen years. Due to good behavior, Applicant actually served only ten years and was released in June 2005. Since Applicant was ordered to remain on probation until February 15, 2010, he was still on probation at the time of the hearing. While in prison, Applicant earned an associate\u2019s degree in mechanical engineering. After his release, Applicant completed a community re-entry program and has re-established ties with family and friends. While incarcerated, Applicant maintained ties with his former employer, and his co-workers helped him with his homework and wrote letters to him. Applicant was rehired by his former employer. Applicant is liked and respected by his co-workers, and he is active in his community. Applicant argues that he has mitigated any security concerns that might exist under Guideline J and that the Judge either did not consider or did not give adequate weight to his evidence of mitigation.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nDaniel Wilkins, Personal Representative\n\nThe Judge found in Applicant\u2019s favor as to Guideline E.  The Judge\u2019s findings regarding Guideline E are not\n1\nat issue.\n2\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On September 9, 2009, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant\nof the basis for that decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline J (Criminal Conduct) and\nGuideline E (Personal Conduct) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as\namended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.  On March 23, 2010, after the hearing,\nAdministrative Judge Arthur E. Marshall, Jr., denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.\nApplicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raises the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge should have found that\nApplicant\u2019s conduct was mitigated, and whether the Judge\u2019s decision is arbitrary, capricious, or\ncontrary to law.  Finding no error, we affirm the Judge\u2019s adverse security clearance decision.\nThe Judge made the following relevant findings of fact: Following a heated argument,\nApplicant shot and wounded a friend who had begun dating the mother of Applicant\u2019s child.\nApplicant was charged with, and convicted of, felony attempted murder and one count of wearing\nor carrying a handgun.  Eight other charges were nolle prosequi.  Applicant was sentenced to thirty\nyears in prison, but the sentence was reduced to fifteen years. Due to good behavior, Applicant\nactually served only ten years and was released in June 2005.  Since Applicant was ordered to remain\non probation until February 15, 2010, he was still on probation at the time of the hearing.  While in\nprison, Applicant earned an associate\u2019s degree in mechanical engineering.  After his release,\nApplicant completed a community re-entry program and has re-established ties with family and\nfriends.  While incarcerated, Applicant maintained ties with his former employer, and his co-workers\nhelped him with his homework and wrote letters to him.  Applicant was rehired by his former\nemployer.  Applicant is liked and respected by his co-workers, and he is active in his community.\nApplicant argues that he has mitigated any security concerns that might exist under Guideline\nJ and that the Judge either did not consider or did not give adequate weight to his evidence of\nmitigation.   There is a rebuttable presumption that the Judge considered all the record evidence,\n1\nunless the Judge specifically states otherwise; and there is no requirement that the Judge mention or\ndiscuss every piece of record evidence when reaching a decision.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 04-08134\nat 3 (App. Bd. May 16, 2005).   Applicant admitted the criminal behavior alleged in the SOR.  The\nburden then shifted to Applicant to extenuate or mitigate the security concerns raised by those\nallegations.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  The Judge concluded that Applicant did not present evidence\nsufficient to overcome the security concerns raised.  The application of disqualifying and mitigating\nconditions and whole-person factors does not turn simply on a finding that one or more of them\napply to the particular facts of a case.  Thus, the presence of some mitigating evidence does not alone\ncompel the Judge to make a favorable security clearance determination.  As the trier of fact, the\nJudge has to weigh the evidence as a whole and decide whether the favorable evidence outweighs\nthe unfavorable evidence, or vice versa.  A party\u2019s disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the\nevidence, or an ability to argue for a different interpretation of the evidence, is not sufficient to\n\nThe Judge correctly observed that the fact that an applicant is still on probation at the time of the hearing is\n2\na disqualifying factor under the Directive at Enclosure 2, \u00b6 31(d).\n3\ndemonstrate that the Judge weighed the evidence or reached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 07-18303 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Nov. 13, 2008).\nIn discussing his mitigating evidence, Applicant specifically mentions the issue of\nrehabilitation and the fact that he was still on probation at the time of the hearing, but successfully\ncompleted his probation shortly thereafter. The Judge specifically considered the issue of\nrehabilitation in light of the seriousness of Applicant\u2019s crime and the fact that Applicant was still on\nprobation at the time of the hearing.   The Judge evaluated the record evidence as a whole and\n2\nconsidered the totality of Applicant\u2019s circumstances.  The Judge also weighed the mitigating\nevidence offered by Applicant against the seriousness of the disqualifying conduct.  The Judge\ndiscussed his application of mitigating factors  at length.  The Judge articulated a rational basis for\nhis decision and reasonably explained why Applicant\u2019s mitigating evidence was insufficient to\novercome the government\u2019s security concerns.  Given the record that was before him, the Judge\u2019s\nultimate unfavorable security clearance decision under Guideline J is not arbitrary, capricious, or\ncontrary to law.   \nApplicant points out that he was put at a disadvantage by the timing of the hearing\u2013the fact\nthat the hearing was held on December 18, 2009, and he was scheduled to complete his probation\non February 15, 2010.  The Judge was aware that Applicant was about to complete his probation and\ndiscussed that situation in his decision.  The fact that Applicant has now successfully completed his\nprobation is new evidence which the Board cannot consider on appeal.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.29.  The\nBoard does not review a case de novo.  Nor does it have the authority to grant a conditional\nclearance.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-24458 at 2 (App. Bd. Jan. 14, 2008).\nAfter reviewing the record, the Board concludes that the Judge examined the relevant data\nand articulated a satisfactory explanation for his decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between\nthe facts found and the choice made.\u2019\u201d Motor Vehicle Mfrs.

On September 9, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under \nGuideline J (Criminal Conduct) and Guideline E (Personal Conduct). The action was taken \nunder Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \n(February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \n(Directive); and the revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on \nDecember 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after \nSeptember 1, 2006.  \n \nOn September 25, 2009, Applicant responded to the SOR. He admitted the sole \nallegation raised under each guideline. He also requested a hearing before a DOHA \nAdministrative Judge. I was assigned the case on November 3, 2009. The parties proposed \na December 18, 2009, hearing. A Notice of Hearing was issued to that effect on November \n13, 2009. \n \n1 \n \n \nMarch 23, 2010\n\n \n2 \n \n                                                \nThe hearing took place as scheduled. Applicant gave testimony and introduced  nine \ndocuments accepted into the record without objection as exhibits (Exs.) A-I.  Three \nwitnesses and Applicant\u2019s personal representative gave testimony on his behalf. Also \naccepted into the record without objection were five documents from Department Counsel, \nmarked and accepted as Exs. 1-5. Applicant was given through January 7, 2010, to submit \nany additional materials. The transcript (Tr.) was received on December 28, 2009.  \nApplicant timely submitted seven additional documents. They were forwarded without \nobjection by Department Counsel and accepted into the record as Exs. J-P. The record was \nclosed on January 12, 2010. Based upon a thorough review of the case file, exhibits, and \ntestimony, security clearance is denied. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant is a 41-year-old engineering technician who has twice worked for his \npresent employer, his most recent tenure having started in 2005. He has a high school \ndiploma and an associate\u2019s degree in science. He is the father of one adult child. \n \n \nApplicant was born in 1968. In 1987, he and his girlfriend had a baby. In about 1991, \nhe started working for his present employer and was eventually granted a security \nclearance.1 His relationship with his girlfriend, the mother of his child, became strained, but \nhe continued to be an important part of his daughter\u2019s life. They began living apart, taking \nturns caring for their child and working on their relationship.2 One day in June 1994, when \nApplicant was about 25 years old, he heard that his girlfriend was seeing another man. The \ndiscovery was devastating. He learned that the man was a friend of his who had gone to \nschool with his brother. He told the friend to stay away from his girlfriend.3 After that, he \ncontinued working on his relationship, but things did not improve.  \n \n \nOn July 29, 1994, Applicant picked up some beer and his gun. He contemplated \ndriving to a reservoir, getting drunk, and killing himself. He saw his mother, however, and \nshe told him to get his daughter\u2019s swimming gear from his girlfriend\u2019s home. He stopped by \nhis girlfriend\u2019s apartment that evening. He found his girlfriend with the same friend he had \ntold to stop interfering with his relationship.4 The discovery upset him and a verbal \naltercation ensued: \u201cI just got really angry basically because the whole time \u2013 the whole \ntime I was trying to work things out with her, [his friend] was just kind of telling [her] to leave \nme and that I\u2019m not a good father, stuff like that.\u201d5   \n \n \nApplicant and his girlfriend tried to talk about their relationship, but the male friend \ninterrupted. His friend\u2019s interference and derogatory comments regarding Applicant made \n \n1  Tr. 20. As a result of Applicant\u2019s July 1994 criminal conduct, discussed below, he later lost his security \nclearance. \n \n2  Tr. 55, 61. \n \n3  Ex. 2 (Police report) at 28. \n \n4  Tr. 59. \n \n5  Tr. 62. \n\n \n3 \n \n                                                \nApplicant, an otherwise shy and unassuming man, more upset. Applicant left his girlfriend\u2019s \napartment bereft and got in his car. His girlfriend, the male friend, and two other friends \nheaded toward another car, where the male friend took the driver\u2019s seat. Words were \nexchanged between the Applicant and his girlfriend, but her companion prepared to drive \naway. Applicant drove his vehicle into their car. He then got out of his car and fired his gun \ntoward the driver\u2019s tinted side window.6  Frightened by his outburst, he dropped the gun and \nfled. Applicant\u2019s male friend was shot in the arm and abdomen. No other passengers were \ninjured. After the police arrived, Applicant called his girlfriend to ask how the friend was. \u201cHe \nsaid he couldn\u2019t believe he had done it and he said it was because [her date/his friend] had \nlied to him.\u201d7 Applicant told his girlfriend that he was suicidal over what he had done, but \nshe told him to turn himself in.8 He was arrested shortly thereafter.  \n \n \nThe incident and Applicant\u2019s arrest were publicized by the press. He was charged \nwith 1) felony Attempted Murder, 2) two counts Wearing or Carrying  a Handgun, 3) two \ncounts Assault with Intent to Maim, 4) four counts Assault, 5) four counts Battery, 6) \nConcealed Deadly Weapon, 7) two counts Reckless Endangerment, 8) two counts \nMalicious Destruction of Property, 9) Failure to Stop After Accident, and 10) Reckless \nDriving. He was found guilty of 1) felony Attempted Murder and 2) one count of Wear/Carry \nHandgun. The remaining charges, noted as 3-10 above, were nolle prosequi. Applicant was \nsentenced to 30 years imprisonment, but the sentence was reduced to a 15- year term. He \nwas released in June 2005 after 10 years for good behavior. He was ordered to remain on \nsupervised probation until February 15, 2010, but it was changed to unsupervised probation \nin early 2009.9   He was on probation at the time of the hearing. \n \n \nWhile incarcerated, Applicant served his time without incident. He underwent \nmandatory therapy and was administered a psychiatric evaluation by a medical doctor. It \nwas determined that he did not have a condition that could impair his judgment or reliability, \nparticularly in the context of safeguarding classified national security information.\u201d10 The \nexamining physician later confirmed this assessment.11 In the interim, Applicant enrolled in \na course of study through the state college system. As a result, he earned an associate\u2019s \ndegree in mechanical engineering and received certification in that field. He completed a \ncommunity re-entry program after his release. Now that he has reentered society, he is \ndetermined to adjust well.12 \n \n \n6  Id. at 3. \n \n7  Id. at 22. \n \n8  Id. at 22-23. \n \n9  The government argues that more time is needed beyond Applicant\u2019s probation to demonstrate his \nrehabilitation.  \n \n10  Tr. 20-21; Ex. A (Medical/Psychiatric). \n \n11  Id. \n \n12  Id. \n \n\n \n4 \n \n                                                \n \nToday, Applicant is on cordial terms with both his ex-girlfriend and his friend, to \nwhom she is now married. Since his release from prison, he has become especially close \nwith his daughter, who is now 22 years old and resides with her mother and her mother\u2019s \nhusband. Applicant and his daughter visit at least once a week and speak on the telephone \nseveral times a week.13 She notes, \u201cTalking to him always makes me feel so much better \nwhen something is bothering me. Whenever I need advice about something or I\u2019m just plain \nworried about something he is one of the first people I call.\u201d14 Regarding Applicant\u2019s \nrelationship with her mother and her mother\u2019s husband, the daughter writes, \u201cThe situation \nbetween my dad and mom and her family has been really good too. He and my mom have \nbeen on friendly terms, which I am so grateful for. I don\u2019t feel like there\u2019s a lot of tension \ndespite what happened and I really get the sense of things being in the past with them.\u201d15 \nShe concludes by writing, \u201cI don\u2019t feel like mom, or [her husband, Applicant\u2019s intended \nvictim], or anyone is threatened at all. My dad has really turned his life around. He is a hard \nworker and very responsible and from what I\u2019ve seen he is respected and loved by all of his \nfriends, family, and coworkers.\u201d16 Similarly, the child\u2019s mother, Applicant\u2019s ex-girlfriend, \nnotes, \u201cI have never felt threatened by [Applicant] in any way. . . He has been a \nresponsible, loving father since being released.  . . . I have no ill will to him and believe he \nhas none to me. . . . I believe [Applicant] poses no threat to [her husband] as well.. . . I \nbelieve all is in the past.\u201d17 \n \nAt work, co-workers and associates who knew Applicant were \u201cshocked\u201d to learn \nfrom Applicant or the press that he had been involved in the incident.18 He did not conceal \nthe truth about the incident. Instead, he was open to questioning about the accuracy of \nnews stories and various rumors regarding the incident, although he kept the details to a \nminimum while he faced trial and sentencing. His peers\u2019 shock and his reticence were \nconsistent with his reputation, which was for being a hard worker who is a \u201cshy young man, \nbut very personable.\u201d19 Some of his co-workers maintained contact with Applicant after he \nwas incarcerated, helping him with his studies and writing him letters. Confidence in \nApplicant remained solid and he was invited back to his former place of employment as \nsoon as practicable after his release from prison.20  He returned to his employer in July \n2005 as a computer-aided drafting (CAD) operator/draftsman a month after his release. \n \n13  Tr. 71. \n \n14  Ex.

He states, \u201cI guess any \nneighbor needs help, I\u2019m more than happy to help them.\u201d25  A retired law enforcement \nofficer who knows Applicant socially and is fully aware of Applicant\u2019s criminal past writes \nthat Applicant is impressive through \u201chis self-motivating skills, continually distinguishing \nhimself by achieving new things that sets him apart from others. . . . Based on my personal \nobservations, conversations, and knowledge, I recommend without reservation or hesitation \n[Applicant] for a [se\n \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the administrative \njudge must consider the revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the AG lists potentially disqualifying conditions \nand mitigating conditions, which are useful in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access \nto classified information. The guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing \nthe complexities of human behavior, they are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in \nthe adjudicative process. An administrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, \nimpartial, and commonsense decision. Under AG \u00b6 2(c), this process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative \njudge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, \nfavorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. The protection of the national security is \nthe paramount consideration.

The ultimate burden of \npersua\nrd classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather \n applicant.\n It is merely an indication that an applicant has not met \nthe strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for \nissuing\nalysis \nIn reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, \nlogical, and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided \ndrawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. The government must \npresent evidence to establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. An applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . . 27\nsion to obtain a favorable clearance decision is on an applicant.28  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safegua\nthan actual, risk of compromise of classified information.  \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d EO 12968, Section 3.1(b), lists multiple prerequisites for access to classified or \nsensitive information. The Appeal Board has stated that \u201c(t)he clearly consistent standard \nindicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of \ndenials.\u201d29 Any reasonable doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access to \nsensitive information must be resolved in favor of protecting such sensitive information.30  \nThe decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a determination \nas to the loyalty of an\n31\n a clearance. \n \n \nAn\n \nGuideline J \u2013 Criminal Conduct \n \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability or willingness to \n32\ncomply with laws, rules, and regulations.\n Here, in 1994, Applicant was charged with \n                                                 \n27 See also ISCR Case No. 94-1075 at 3-4 (App. Bd.

In the interim, he has not only maintained the admiration and trust of his \nemploy\nr it happened under such unusual \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s \nreliabil\nhis crime, obviating \napplica ion of CC MC AG \u00b6 32(b) (the person was pressured or coerced into committing the \nact and\nfelony Attempted Murder and nine related crimes. He was convicted of Attempted Murder \nand one count of Wear/Carry Handgun. Ordered to serve a probationary period, his \nprobation was set to expire on February 15, 2010. Consequently, Criminal Conduct \nDisqualifying Conditions (CC DC) AG \u00b6 31(a) (a single serious crime or multiple lesser \noffenses\u201d) and CC DC AG \u00b6 31(c) (\u201callegation or admission of criminal conduct, regardless \nof whether the person was formally charged, formally prosecuted, or convicted), and CC \nDC AG \u00b6 31(d) (individual is currently on parole or probation) apply. With disqualifyi\nAG \u00b6 32. \n \nApplicant\u2019s relationship with his child\u2019s mother began to fade as she started a liaison \nwith one of his friends. Despite attempts to work on the relationship, the liaison persisted. \nApplicant was infuriated by his friend\u2019s betrayal and the friend\u2019s belittling treatment of him \nas both a man and as a father. When he discovered them together one night in the summer \nof 1994, Applicant, a bereft and near-suicidal young man, shot and wounded his rival in a \ncrime of passion. The incident frightened and repelled him to the extent he contemplated \ntaking his own life. He was arrested, found guilty of Attempted Murder and Wear/Carry \nHandgun, and sentenced to 15 years in prison. Released for good behavior after serving 10 \nyears, he successfully completed mandatory therapy, a psychiatric exam, and a so\ner and peers, but earned the trust of his daughter and his ex-girlfriend.  \n \nMoreover, it is notable that Applicant is a draftsman turned engineer. The availability \nof a firearm at the time was a matter of happenstance and there is no evidence that its \navailability was planned as part of an antisocial crime spree. Neither his profession, \nlifestyle, nor his inclination, is that of one given to the random or regular discharge of \nfirearms. His crimes represent an isolated incident related to a failing romance in his mid-\n20s. Unlike larceny, extortion, molestation, or drug-related crimes, for example, his crimes \nare not the result of a compulsion, an inherent disregard of the law, or a fundamental \ndifficulty appreciating the distinction between right and wrong. It was an isolated, \naberrational incident, the grievous nature of which he instantly appreciated, continues to \nlament, and regarding which he has endeavored to make amends to society, his family, and \nhis victim. His life was devoid of violent behavior before the incident and has remained \nviolence-free in the intervening 16 years. Today, both his family and professional peers \ncomplement Applicant for his personal, judgment, reliability, and affability. Given these \nunique circumstances, his general reputation, and his rehabilitative strides in the \nintervening 16 years, Criminal Conduct Mitigating Condition (CC MC) AG \u00b6 32(a) (so much \ntime has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, o\nity, trustworthiness, or good judgment) applies.  \n \nApplicant admits and has taken responsibility for his actions. Therefore, CC MC AG \n\u00b6 32(c) (evidence the person did not commit the act) does not apply. Further, there is no \nevidence that a third party or any force but passion was involved in \nt\n those pressures are no longer present in the person\u2019s life).  \n \n\n \n8 \n \nf \ntime without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or restitution, job training or higher \neducat\n probation\u2019s expiration should eliminate any \nremaining doubts regarding his ability to maintain a security clearance. At present, \nhowev\nToday, Applicant is in his 40s. His only criminal act occurred when he was 25. For \nthat act, he completed his term of incarceration early for good behavior. While in prison, he \ncompleted a college degree, therapy, and a psychological examination. Shortly after his \nrelease, he successfully completed a community re-entry program and is now considered a \nreliable neighbor and friend. He was quickly rehired by his employer, peers from which had \nencouraged him throughout his confinement. Since returning to work, he has been \npromoted and appraised as an excellent employee. Applicant\u2019s probation was set to expire \nin February 2010 and, at the time of the hearing, he had completed the vast majority of his \nprobationary period without incident. Significantly, he has regained the trust of his daughter, \nand made peace with both his ex-girlfriend and his friend, the victim of his crime. As well, \nApplicant fully acknowledges his criminal behavior and expresses his remorse through both \nhis words and his demeanor.  Under these unique circumstances, CC MC AG \u00b6 32(d) \n(there is evidence of successful rehabilitation, including but not limited to the passage o\nion, good employment record, or constructive community involvement) applies. \n \nApplicant\u2019s criminal conduct demands heightened scrutiny. The crimes for which \nApplicant was found guilty were exceptionally grave and were committed while he had a \nsecurity clearance. Few crimes are on the level of severity of attempted murder and the \ntrust breached by that crime goes to the core of this process. The government argues that \nApplicant requires additional time to demonstrate his rehabilitation. I agree to the extent \nthat additional time is warranted to mitigate all criminal conduct security concerns. The \ntiming of this process has worked against Applicant. The hearing was on December 18, \n2009, the record closed on January 12, 2010, and Applicant\u2019s probation was poised to \nexpire on February 15, 2010. Consequently, there is no documentary evidence that he has \nsuccessfully completed his probationary period and any other requirements related to that \nperiod. In light of Applicant\u2019s impressive efforts, this may seem to be a ceremonial \ntechnicality, but the security clearance process requires that any reasonable doubt about \nwhether an applicant should be allowed access to sensitive information must be resolved  \nin favor of protecting such sensitive information. Moreover, a demonstration by Applicant \nthat he is continuing his efforts after his\ner, such security concerns remain. \n \n Guideline E - Personal Conduct   \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 15, conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, \ndishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions about \nan individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. At \nissue here are the crimes for which Applicant was found guilty and related charges. They \ndo not involve conduct regarding the security clearance process, an area not already \ncovered by another adjudicative guideline, not involving a violation of a condition of \nemployment, or regarding association with others involved in criminal activity. Other than \ngeneral security concerns regarding Applicant\u2019s personal conduct in terms of his criminal \npast, which were duly considered under the preceding section regarding Guideline J, only \nPersonal Conduct Disqualifying Condition (PC DC) AG \u00b6 16(e) (personal conduct or \nconcealment of information about one\u2019s conduct, that creates a vulnerability to exploitation, \n\n \n9 \n \nrofessional, or community standing. . . .) applies, due to his criminal act \nand incarceration.  \nriately \nconsidered under, Guideline J.

This is especially true since \nthe security concerns giving rise to Guideline E are similar to, and more approp\n \nHere, there is no evidence that Applicant omitted, concealed, or falsified the truth \nregarding his part in the shooting. Rather, there is evidence that sufficient press coverage \nand personal disclosure existed to permit the story to spread on its own. The evidence also \nshows that when questioned by acquaintances regarding what they had heard or read, he \nreadily corroborated stories regarding the incident. Since that time, his story has been \nfurther publicized, he has been open about his crime, and he has made overt attempts to \nrehabilitate himself. Such facts raise AG \u00b6 17(e) (the individual has taken po\n \nApplicant fully admits that he committed his crime. Among Applicant\u2019s rehabilitative \nmeasures are psychological therapy and a psychological evaluation, which concluded that \nhe did not have a condition that could impair his judgment or reliability, particularly in the \ncontext of safeguarding classified national security information. Moreover, anecdotally, \nApplicant\u2019s ex-girlfriend states that her family and Applicant are on amicable terms and that \nhe does not pose a threat to her family.

In reviewing the complete record, I \nconsidered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \n \nIn light of the factors enumerated in AG \u00b6 2(a), it must be noted that Applicant is a \nhighly credible, optimistic, and soft spoken man who, 16 years ago and in his early to mid- \n20s, committed a serious crime of passion against a suitor to the mother of his child. He \nheld a security clearance at the time. Although the crime was committed in the heat of the \nmoment, it was exceptionally heinous and resulted in physical injury. At the same time, it \nwas an isolated incident totally inconsistent with his natural character. Since that time, he \nhas been tried and sentenced for Attempted Murder and for Wearing or Carrying a \nHandgun. While in prison, he underwent therapy to address his conduct and he was \nsuccessfully examined by a qualified physician \n \nIn prison and since his release, he has successfully worked to rehabilitate himself. \nHe completed a college degree and quickly resumed employment, where he has since \nbeen promoted and shown himself to be a valued, well-regarded, and well-rated employee. \nHe has maintained the trust in peers who knew him before the incident and has won the \ntrust of those he has since met. In much the same manner that the criminal justice system \nreleased him from prison five years early for good behavior, it also determined that he \ncould be entrusted to complete his probation unsupervised. He completed a societal re-\nentry program and has reintegrated into his community without difficulty. He built a very \nclose bond to his daughter. Neither she, his ex-girlfriend, nor their family considers him to \nbe a threat. He has faced the consequences of his actions resolutely, paid for his crime,  is \nopen about his criminal past,  and is endeavoring to move on with his life without further \nincident.

On March 5, 2009, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of\nthe basis for that decision\u2014security concerns raised, Guideline E (Personal Conduct) of Department\nof Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.\nOn October 15, 2009, after the hearing, Administrative Judge Michael H. Leonard denied\nApplicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant to the Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28\nand E3.1.30.\nApplicant raises the following issues on appeal: whether he was denied the due process\naccorded by the Directive and whether the Judge\u2019s decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to\nlaw.  For the following reasons, the Board affirms the Judge\u2019s unfavorable decision.\n\nApplicant claims that he did not receive the investigative file in time to prepare for the hearing.  At the\n1\nbeginning of the hearing the Judge asked Applicant if he was \u201cready to proceed with the hearing today.\u201d  Applicant\nreplied \u201cYes, Your honor.\u201d  (Transcript, pp. 11-12).  \nApplicant asserts that he was denied the due process accorded by the Directive.  He cites\nrecord evidence against him prepared by a former employer and notes that he never had an\nopportunity to cross-examine the employer.  The employer did not appear at the hearing, so\ntestimony and subsequent cross-examination were never at issue.  Government Exhibit 4 consists\nof material prepared by the employer.  Applicant was twice asked if he objected to Government\nExhibit 4.  The first time he said, \u201cNo, Your Honor.\u201d  The second time he said, \u201cI have no\nobjections, Your Honor.\u201d  (Transcript, p. 42).  Furthermore, the Board notes that the Judge asked\nApplicant several questions regarding his choice to represent himself, his age, and his education,\nbefore permitting him to represent himself.  At that point the Judge also discussed the process of\nrepresenting oneself, making objections and speaking up.  (Transcript, pp. 11-15).  The Judge took\nreasonable steps to ensure that Applicant would be able to represent himself adequately.   Although\npro se applicants cannot be expected to act like lawyers, they are expected to take timely, reasonable\nsteps to protect their rights under the Directive.   See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 00-0593 at 4 (App. Bd.\n1\nMay 14, 2001).  If they fail to take timely, reasonable steps to protect their rights, their failure to act\ndoes not constitute a denial of their rights.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 02-19896 at 6 (App. Bd. Dec.\n29, 2003).  Accordingly, Applicant\u2019s argument in this regard does not persuade the Board that the\ncase should be reversed or remanded.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 05-03307 at 2 (App. Bd. May 7,\n2007).\nApplicant alleges for the first time on appeal that the former employer may have been\nmotivated by racism.  There is no record evidence to support that allegation.\nApplicant points to some mitigating evidence.  The presence of some mitigating evidence\ndoes not alone compel the Judge to make a favorable security clearance decision.  As the trier of fact,\nthe Judge has to weigh the evidence as a whole and decide whether the favorable evidence outweighs\nthe unfavorable evidence, or vice versa.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-10320 at 2 (App. Bd. Nov. 7,\n2007).  A party\u2019s disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, or an ability to argue for\na different interpretation of the evidence, is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed the\nevidence or reached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See,\ne.g., ISCR Case No. 06-17409 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2007).  In this case, the Judge weighed the\nmitigating evidence offered by Applicant against the seriousness of the disqualifying conduct and\nconsidered the possible application of relevant conditions and factors.  He concluded that Applicant\nhad engaged in two types of wrongful conduct that call into question his judgment, trustworthiness\nand reliability.  These conclusions are reasonably supported by the record.\nTo the extent that Applicant\u2019s brief challenges some of the Judge\u2019s findings, we conclude\nthat Judge\u2019s material findings of security concern are based on substantial record evidence and are\ntherefore sustainable.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 08-04624 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 28, 2009).\nThe Board does not review a case de novo.  The favorable evidence cited by Applicant is not\nsufficient to demonstrate the Judge\u2019s decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g.,\nISCR Case No. 06-11172 at 3 (App. Bd. Sep. 4, 2007).  After reviewing the record, the Board\n\nconcludes that the Judge examined the relevant data and articulated a satisfactory explanation for\nhis decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.\u2019\u201d Motor\nVehicle Mfrs.

Based on the record as a whole, the following facts are established by substantial evidence. Applicant is a 50-year-old telecommunications specialist. He is currently unemployed, but a defense contractor is sponsoring him for a clearance with plans to offer him a part-time job should he obtain a clearance.

The facts and\ncircumstances surrounding Applicant\u2019s conduct create doubts about his judgment,\nreliability, and trustworthiness. Applicant did not present sufficient evidence to explain,\nextenuate, or mitigate the security concerns stemming from these incidents.\nAccordingly, as explained below in detail, this case is decided against Applicant. \nOctober 15, 2009\n\n  This case is adjudicated under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry,\n1\ndated February 20, 1960, as amended, and DoD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program, dated January 2, 1992, as amended (Directive). In addition, because the SOR\nwas issued after September 1, 2006, the revised Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access\nto Classified Information (Revised Guidelines) approved by the President on December 29, 2005, then made\neffective within the Defense Department on September 1, 2006, apply to this case. They supersede or replace\nthe guidelines published in Enclosure 2 to the Directive. \n2\nStatement of the Case\nActing under the relevant Executive Order and DoD Directive,  the Defense\n1\nOffice of Hearings and Appeals (the Agency) issued a statement of reasons (SOR) to\nApplicant on March 5, 2009. The SOR is equivalent to a complaint and it details the\nfactual basis for the action. The SOR alleged security concerns under Guideline E for\npersonal conduct. The SOR also recommended submitting the case to an administrative\njudge for a determination to deny or revoke Applicant\u2019s security clearance. \nApplicant answered the SOR on March 17, 2009, and stated he did not wish to\nhave a hearing due to his financial situation (Applicant resides overseas in Germany).\nThe Agency submitted its written case consisting of all relevant and material information\nthat could be adduced at a hearing. This so-called file of relevant material was mailed to\nApplicant and he responded in timely fashion. The case was assigned to me on June 8,\n2009. Upon review of Applicant\u2019s Answer and his reason for declining a hearing, I\ncontacted Applicant and Department Counsel per e-mail, dated June 25, 2009, and\nadvised Applicant that it was unnecessary to travel to the United States for a hearing\nbecause it was possible to conduct the hearing via video teleconference (VTC).\nApplicant then elected to proceed with a VTC hearing, and the case was converted to a\nhearing case. \nThe hearing took place as scheduled on July 28, 2009. The government called\nno witnesses and offered Exhibits 1\u20134, which were admitted. Applicant\u2019s testimony was\ntaken and Exhibits A\u2013JJ were admitted, except for Exhibits R, S, X, Y, Z, and CC, which\nwere excluded for the reasons stated during the hearing. \nThe record was left open to allow Applicant to submit additional documentary\nevidence. Those matters were timely submitted, and they are marked and admitted as\nfollows: (1) Exhibit KK\u2013DD Form 214, date of separation from service December 1986;\n(2) Exhibit LL\u2013DD Form 214, date of separation from service October 1989; (3) Exhibit\nMM\u2013memorandum, \ndated \nJune \n21, \n2005, \nconcerning \ncontractor \nletter \nof\naccreditation/identification for Applicant; (4) Exhibit NN\u2013report of investigation\nconcerning Applicant (eight pages); (5) Exhibit OO\u2013medical record, dated January 9,\n2006 (an English translation and the German original); and (6) Exhibit PP\u2013stipulation of\nsettlement in Applicant\u2019s case under The Longshore and Harbor Workers\u2019\nCompensation Act (LHWCA), 18 pages. In addition, Applicant submitted a three-page\nletter setting forth facts and arguments. It is marked as Exhibit QQ, but not admitted\nbecause the record was not kept open for that purpose. The 224-page hearing\ntranscript (Tr.) was received August 5, 2009. \n\n Appellate Exhibit II.\n2\n Much of this information is found in Exhibit PP. \n3\n Exhibit KK.\n4\n3\nProcedural Matters\nApplicant, per e-mail dated July 8, 2009, moved to dismiss the SOR allegations\nfor various reasons (Appellate Exhibit I). The motion was denied because an\nadministrative judge lacks authority to dismiss an SOR (Tr. 22\u201323). In a subsequent e-\nmail, dated July 24, 2009, Applicant requested that his security clearance be reinstated\nimmediately on the grounds that he had never committed a breach of national security\nas well as for additional reasons (Appellate Exhibit III). I construed the request as a\nmotion to dismiss the SOR and denied that motion as well (Tr. 25\u201326).  \nA pre-hearing conference was conducted by telephone on July 9, 2009, to\ndiscuss certain issues in advance of the hearing. The results of the pre-hearing\nconference were summarized in writing and made part of the record (Appellate Exhibit\nII). Neither party had additions, corrections, or objections to the summary (Tr. 22\u201325). \nFindings of Fact\nUnder Guideline E, the SOR alleged two incidents of work-related conduct\nsummarized as follows: (1) Applicant used a company credit card for unauthorized\npurchases in September 2006; and (2) Applicant failed to return government-issued\nequipment after he left employment with a defense contractor in about October 2005.\nBased on the record as a whole, the following facts are established by substantial\nevidence.\nApplicant is a 50-year-old telecommunications specialist. He is currently\nunemployed, but a defense contractor is sponsoring him for a clearance with plans to\noffer him a part-time job should he obtain a clearance.  His first two marriages ended in\n2\ndivorce, and he is currently separated from his third wife. He has children from the\nmarriages as well. \n1.\nApplicant\u2019s previous employment history.\nBecause this case involves work-related conduct, Applicant\u2019s employment history\nis set forth in detail.  After graduating from high school in 1977, Applicant worked as a\n3\nlaborer in a series of jobs until he enlisted in the U.S. Army in 1979. He completed basic\ntraining, and then completed advanced training in telecommunications. He was\nassigned to Germany in 1980, and he worked in the field of telecommunications until his\nhonorable discharge in December 1986, when he was a sergeant (pay grade E-5).4\nMost, but not all, of that period was served in Germany, and he was separated in\nGermany. \n\n Exhibit LL. \n5\n4\nAbout three months later in March 1987, Applicant reenlisted in the Army. Again,\nhe worked in telecommunications, but his service was cut short when he was\ndischarged after two years and six months due to alcohol abuse\u2013rehabilitation failure.5\nDespite the reason for separation, his character of service was deemed honorable, and\nhe was discharged as a private first class (pay grade E-3).\n \nIn 1990, Applicant began work for a company as a telecommunications network\ntechnician working on various military installations in Germany. He remained in this job\nuntil about 1993. There was then no work available for Applicant in Germany in his field,\nso Applicant accepted a job as a manager at a fast-food restaurant in the U.S. In about\n1994, he moved to another state in the U.S. and began working as a manager of a gas\nstation. He remained in this job for about a year until 1995, when he returned to\nGermany.\nIn about March 1996, Applicant went back to work for a previous employer as a\ntelecommunications network technician. He worked in this position in Germany for\nabout six months. In the summer of 1996, Applicant began work with another company\ndoing satellite installation. He worked throughout Europe for about six months.\n In about February 1997, Applicant returned to a previous employer in the same\nposition as a telecommunications network technician. He continued in this job through\nabout September 1998. He then started work for another company as a\ntelecommunications consultant. He worked in this position until about March 2001,\nwhen he was laid off due to a decline in the telecommunications field.\nApplicant was unemployed until about March 2002, when he accepted a job as a\nconsultant working throughout Europe setting up telecommunications conferences. He\nleft this job about a year later in March 2003. He returned to this employer about one\nmonth later and was supposed to work in Iraq, but that mission or job was cancelled\nabout two months later. \nIn about August 2003, Applicant again started work for a previous employer. He\nworked as a telecommunications technician in an East African country for about three\nmonths. He was then unemployed from the end of 2003 until September 2004. He then\naccepted a job working on satellite systems in Iraq, and he worked in this job until about\nFebruary 2005. He began another job about two months later. This job required him to\ninstall satellite and wireless systems in Iraq for the U.S. military. He left this job about\ntwo months later in June 2005, when he accepted a job with a defense contractor  in\nIraq (Company A). The circumstances of his employment with Company A and\nCompany B, another defense contractor, are the subject of the SOR allegations and are\ndiscussed below.\n\n Exhibit MM.\n6\n Exhibit PP at 6.\n7\n Exhibit GG. \n8\n Tr. 195\u2013198. \n9\n Tr. 137, 195\u2013198. \n10\n Exhibit 4 (Attachment G). \n11\n Exhibit 4 (Attachment G, e-mail dated July 31, 2006). \n12\n5\n2.\nApplicant\u2019s employment with Company A and the government-issued\nequipment.  \nIn June 2005, Applicant began employment with Company A as a senior field\nservice technician (VTC) in Iraq.  In about October 2005, Applicant had an argument\n6\nwith another employee at the work site and he passed out.  He was hospitalized in Iraq\n7\nand eventually moved to a U.S. military medical facility in Germany. He stayed there\nuntil his blood pressure was brought under control. In about March 2006, Applicant was\nmedically cleared to return to work, but did not return to his job with Company A. \nPreviously, Applicant was issued military equipment (such as TA-50 gear,\nsleeping bag, sleeping bag line, wet weather gear, poncho line, rubber boots, TA-50\nbag, etc.) from a U.S. Army installation.  He believes he obtained the equipment in\n8\nabout 2004, when he was working for another employer.  Per e-mail, he contacted\n9\nCompany A in about April or May 2005 to arrange a round-trip flight to return the\nequipment (it had been shipped to him from Iraq). A human resources (HR) specialist\nreplied and advised that the equipment was to be returned to the U.S. Army installation,\nnot a Marine Corps base as indicated by Applicant. The HR specialist offered to provide\na one-way economy-class airline ticket to the installation and a one-way economy-class\nairline ticket to Applicant\u2019s home of record in the U.S. Applicant deemed that\nunacceptable because he wanted a round-trip airline ticket to and from Germany, his\nplace of residence. As a result, the equipment at issue was not returned, and Applicant\nstill has the equipment in Germany.   \n10\nIn addition, Applicant had another dispute with Company A when items of\npersonal property he left behind in Iraq (due to the medical evacuation) were not\nreturned to him in Germany.  The dispute became so heated that a senior counsel for\n11\nCompany A, who replied to Applicant on behalf of the HR specialist, characterized an e-\nmail from Applicant to the HR specialist as \u201cquite simply outrageous,\u201d and noted that\nApplicant\u2019s e-mail contained \u201cobscene language but also veiled threats.\u201d  Also,\n12\nApplicant took legal action against Company A, when he claimed he was owed\ncompensation benefits and medical benefits due to a work-related injury under the\n\n Exhibit PP. \n13\n Tr. 141. \n14\n Exhibit 4 (Attachment C). \n15\n Exhibit OO.\n16\n Exhibit 4 (Attachment A).\n17\n Exhibit G. \n18\n Exhibit H. \n19\n6\njurisdiction of the Defense Base Act extension of the LHWCA. It appears the claim was\nsettled  for a $40,000 lump-sum payment to Applicant in about August 2008.13\n3.\nApplicant\u2019s employment with Company B and his misuse of the credit card.\nIn about June 2006, Applicant began employment with Company B under a one-\nyear contract to work in Iraq.  Company B issued to Applicant an American Express\n14\ncredit card for company-related business expenses. Applicant acknowledged in writing\nthe terms associated with using the credit card, which included termination of\nemployment or loss of a U.S. Government security clearance if the card was misused.  \n15\nApplicant stopped working for Company B in September 2006, when his wife,\nwho was then pregnant (and she had previously suffered a miscarriage in 2005),  was\n16\nsick and demanded Applicant return home to Germany. Applicant departed Iraq on\nabout September 8 and was to return to a Marine Corps base in the U.S. to out-process\nand return any issued equipment. Company B authorized him to travel to Germany\nduring the trip to visit his spouse, but the detour was at his own expense.  Applicant\n17\ntraveled by air from Iraq to London, when he then flew to Frankfurt, rented a car, and\ndrove to his residence in Germany. He dropped off his gear and then returned the rental\ncar to the Frankfurt airport the same day. He charged the airline ticket to Frankfurt and\nthe rental car on the company-issued credit card. He stayed briefly in Germany and\nthen traveled to the U.S. where he returned equipment, but it appears did not complete\nother out-processing items. He then returned to Germany. Company B had no\ncommunication from Applicant from September 8 until Applicant reestablished contact\non about September 26, 2006.\nWhen he decided to stop working for Company B in September 2006, Applicant\nsent a letter of resignation via e-mail to the company president.  He explained he was\n18\nresigning due to his wife\u2019s condition and her request that he return to Germany. The\ncompany president replied, per e-mail, the same day. He indicated he was sorry to lose\nApplicant as an employee and said that \u201cI understand that you need to do what you\nneed to do.\u201d  Applicant, in his hearing testimony, pointed to that language as implicit\n19\nauthorization for him to use the company-issued credit card to pay for the Germany-\nrelated travel expenses because the president knew Applicant did not have a personal\n\n Tr. 147\u2013151. \n20\n Exhibit 4. \n21\n Exhibit 3. \n22\n Exhibit 3. \n23\n Exhibit 4 (Attachment A). \n24\n Tr. 194. \n25\n Most of this information is based on Exhibit PP. \n26\n7\ncredit card.  I find that the particular phrase in the president\u2019s e-mail was an expression\n20\nof empathy or understanding of Applicant\u2019s situation; it was not any type of authorization\nto use the company-issued credit card for personal expenses.  \nIn subsequent and multiple e-mails, the company president informed Applicant\nthat certain charges to the credit card were not authorized and raised other concerns as\nwell.  Company B determined Applicant owed the sum of $385.06, and informed\n21\nApplicant on about September 27, 2006.  The next day, Applicant wrote a check for\n22\nthat amount and sent it to Company B, which cashed it.  Subsequently, in October\n23\n2006, Company B filed an adverse incident report concerning Applicant with an agency\nof the Defense Department.  The report addressed several subjects that are not the\n24\nbasis for the SOR. In hindsight, Applicant acknowledges that he did not handle the\nsituation with Company B well, and that he should have had better communication with\nthe company president.  \n25\n4.\nApplicant\u2019s subsequent employment and current life situation.26\nReturning to Germany in October 2006, Applicant did satellite work for a German\ncompany for a couple of months. He has been essentially unemployed since about\nDecember 2006, which is about when he and his wife separated. Since then, Applicant\nhas been homeless at times, living on the streets and in a homeless shelter. He, like his\nwife, received welfare money from the German government. He claimed to have\nattempted suicide in about April 2007, when he overdosed on heart medicine pills. He\nclaimed that he tried to kill himself because of the pressure of not working and other\nissues. He claimed that he then spent three weeks in a German psychiatric clinic. He is\nnow living in Germany, separated from his wife, where he has the offer of part-time\nemployment with a U.S. defense contractor.  \nPolicies\nThis section sets forth the general principles of law and policies that apply to an\nindustrial security clearance case. To start, the only purpose of a clearance decision is\nto decide if an applicant is suitable for access to classified information.\n\n Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988) (\u201cit should be obvious that no one has a \u2018right\u2019 to\n27\na security clearance\u201d); Duane v. Department of Defense, 275 F.3d 988, 994 (10  Cir. 2002) (no right to a\nth\nsecurity clearance).\n 484 U.S. at 531.\n28\n Directive, \u00b6 3.2. \n29\n Directive, \u00b6 3.2. \n30\n ISCR Case No. 02-18663 (App. Bd. Mar. 23, 2004).\n31\n Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.14.\n32\n Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n33\n Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n34\n Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n35\n ISCR Case No. 01-20700 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002) (citations omitted).\n36\n8\nIt is well-established law that no one has a right to a security clearance.  As\n27\nnoted by the Supreme Court in the case of Department of Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe clearly\nconsistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they\nmust, on the side of denials.\u201d  Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive,\n28\nany doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified\ninformation will be resolved in favor of protecting national security.\nA favorable clearance decision establishes eligibility of an applicant to be granted\na security clearance for access to confidential, secret, or top-secret information.  An\n29\nunfavorable decision (1) denies any application, (2) revokes any existing security\nclearance, and (3) prevents access to classified information at any level.  \n30\nThere is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for\naccess to classified information.  The government has the burden of presenting\n31\nevidence to establish facts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted.  An\n32\napplicant is responsible for presenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate\nfacts that have been admitted or proven.  In addition, an applicant has the ultimate\n33\nburden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.  In Egan, the Supreme\n34\nCourt stated that the burden of proof is less than a preponderance of the evidence.35\nThe agency appellate authority has followed the Court\u2019s reasoning, and a judge\u2019s\nfindings of fact are reviewed under the substantial-evidence standard.36\nThe Revised Guidelines set forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when\nevaluating a person\u2019s security clearance eligibility, including disqualifying conditions\n(DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) for each guideline. In addition, each clearance\ndecision must be a commonsense decision based upon consideration of all the relevant\n\n Executive Order 10865, \u00a7 7.\n37\n Revised Guidelines, \u00b6\u00b6\u00b6 15, 16, 17 (setting forth the security concern and the disqualifying and mitigating\n38\nconditions).  \n Revised Guidelines, \u00b6 15.\n39\n9\nand material information, the pertinent criteria and adjudication factors, and the whole-\nperson concept. \nA person granted access to classified information enters into a special\nrelationship with the government. The government must be able to have a high degree\nof trust and confidence in those persons to whom it grants access to classified\ninformation. The decision to deny a person a security clearance is not a determination\nof an applicant\u2019s loyalty.  Instead, it is a determination that an applicant has not met the\n37\nstrict guidelines the President has established for granting eligibility for access.\nAnalysis\nPersonal conduct under Guideline E  includes issues of false statements and\n38\ncredible adverse information that may not be enough to support action under any other\nguideline. In particular, security concerns may arise due to:\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect\nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful\nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other\nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.  \n39\nBoth the disqualifying and mitigating conditions should be analyzed in light of the\nrecord as a whole. And unique to this case is the nature of the difficult work conditions\nin Iraq, the potential danger of working in Iraq, and the associated stress. Accordingly, I\nhave considered these matters in reaching my decision.  \nThe record shows Applicant engaged in wrongful work-related conduct that calls\ninto question his reliability, trustworthiness, and judgment. The record establishes that\nApplicant: (1) used a company credit card for unauthorized purchases in September\n2006; and (2) failed to return government-issued equipment after he left employment\nwith a defense contractor in about October 2005, and he still possesses the equipment.\nThese two matters are substantially narrower issues than the several issues raised in\nthe adverse information report submitted by Company B, and my decision is limited to\nthe SOR. \nThe two incidents of wrongful work-related conduct raise security concerns under\nthe following disqualifying conditions: \n\n10\n\u00b6 16(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas\nthat is not sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single\nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-\nperson \nassessment \nof \nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness,\nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and\nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the person may not\nproperly safeguard protected information; and \n\u00b6 16(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under\nany other guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse\ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information\nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment,\nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply\nwith rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the\nperson may not properly safeguard protected information. This includes\nbut is not limited to consideration of:\n(1) untrustworthy or unreliable behavior to include breach of client\nconfidentiality, release of proprietary information, unauthorized release of\nsensitive corporate or other government protected information:\n(2) disruptive, violent, or other inappropriate behavior in the workplace; \n(3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations; and\n(4) evidence of significant misuse of Government or other employer's time\nor resources.\nTaken together, the two incidents show inability or unwillingness (or both) to abide by\nworkplace rules and norms. This raises questions or doubts about Applicant\u2019s ability to\nproperly handle and safeguard classified information. \nI considered the mitigating conditions under Guideline E and conclude none\napply in Applicant\u2019s favor. Concerning SOR \u00b6 1.a, Applicant\u2019s use of the company-\nissued credit card was improper, and I am persuaded that Applicant knew that when he\nused it. To his credit, he promptly paid Company B the money they demanded. But his\nattempt to justify his misuse by pointing to the company president\u2019s e-mail (\u201cyou need to\ndo what you need to do\u201d) is misplaced. It is nothing more than a transparent\nrationalization used in an attempt to conceal the truth. Concerning SOR \u00b6 1.b, the\ngovernment-issued equipment is not of great monetary value, but Applicant continues to\npossess the equipment. His long-term retention of the equipment likely amounts to\nwrongful appropriation or larceny of the equipment. Given his disingenuous explanation\nfor using the credit card and his ongoing possession of the government-issued\nequipment, Applicant does not receive the benefit of any mitigating conditions.\nAccordingly, Guideline E is decided against Applicant. In reaching this conclusion, I\n\n Revised Guidelines, \u00b6 2(a)(1) \u2013 (9).\n40\n11\ngave due consideration to the nine-factor whole-person concept,  and none of those\n40\nfactors is sufficient to change the outcome of the case. \nTo conclude, Applicant did not present sufficient evidence to explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate the security concerns under Guideline E. Applicant did not meet his ultimate\nburden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision. This case is decided\nagainst Applicant.\n \nFormal Findings\nThe formal findings on the SOR allegations, as required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of\nEnclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline E:\nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.a\u20131.b:\n \nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of the record as a whole, it is not clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to\nclassified information is denied.        \nMichael H. Leonard\nAdministrative Judge \n",

On March 5, 2009, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of\nthe basis for that decision\u2014security concerns raised, Guideline E (Personal Conduct) of Department\nof Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.\nOn October 15, 2009, after the hearing, Administrative Judge Michael H. Leonard denied\nApplicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant to the Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28\nand E3.1.30.\nApplicant raises the following issues on appeal: whether he was denied the due process\naccorded by the Directive and whether the Judge\u2019s decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to\nlaw.  For the following reasons, the Board affirms the Judge\u2019s unfavorable decision.\n\nApplicant claims that he did not receive the investigative file in time to prepare for the hearing.  At the\n1\nbeginning of the hearing the Judge asked Applicant if he was \u201cready to proceed with the hearing today.\u201d  Applicant\nreplied \u201cYes, Your honor.\u201d  (Transcript, pp. 11-12).  \n2\nApplicant asserts that he was denied the due process accorded by the Directive.  He cites\nrecord evidence against him prepared by a former employer and notes that he never had an\nopportunity to cross-examine the employer.  The employer did not appear at the hearing, so\ntestimony and subsequent cross-examination were never at issue.  Government Exhibit 4 consists\nof material prepared by the employer.  Applicant was twice asked if he objected to Government\nExhibit 4.  The first time he said, \u201cNo, Your Honor.\u201d  The second time he said, \u201cI have no\nobjections, Your Honor.\u201d  (Transcript, p. 42).  Furthermore, the Board notes that the Judge asked\nApplicant several questions regarding his choice to represent himself, his age, and his education,\nbefore permitting him to represent himself.  At that point the Judge also discussed the process of\nrepresenting oneself, making objections and speaking up.  (Transcript, pp. 11-15).  The Judge took\nreasonable steps to ensure that Applicant would be able to represent himself adequately.   Although\npro se applicants cannot be expected to act like lawyers, they are expected to take timely, reasonable\nsteps to protect their rights under the Directive.   See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 00-0593 at 4 (App. Bd.\n1\nMay 14, 2001).  If they fail to take timely, reasonable steps to protect their rights, their failure to act\ndoes not constitute a denial of their rights.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 02-19896 at 6 (App. Bd. Dec.\n29, 2003).  Accordingly, Applicant\u2019s argument in this regard does not persuade the Board that the\ncase should be reversed or remanded.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 05-03307 at 2 (App. Bd. May 7,\n2007).\nApplicant alleges for the first time on appeal that the former employer may have been\nmotivated by racism.  There is no record evidence to support that allegation.\nApplicant points to some mitigating evidence.  The presence of some mitigating evidence\ndoes not alone compel the Judge to make a favorable security clearance decision.  As the trier of fact,\nthe Judge has to weigh the evidence as a whole and decide whether the favorable evidence outweighs\nthe unfavorable evidence, or vice versa.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-10320 at 2 (App. Bd. Nov. 7,\n2007).  A party\u2019s disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, or an ability to argue for\na different interpretation of the evidence, is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed the\nevidence or reached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See,\ne.g., ISCR Case No. 06-17409 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2007).  In this case, the Judge weighed the\nmitigating evidence offered by Applicant against the seriousness of the disqualifying conduct and\nconsidered the possible application of relevant conditions and factors.  He concluded that Applicant\nhad engaged in two types of wrongful conduct that call into question his judgment, trustworthiness\nand reliability.  These conclusions are reasonably supported by the record.\nTo the extent that Applicant\u2019s brief challenges some of the Judge\u2019s findings, we conclude\nthat Judge\u2019s material findings of security concern are based on substantial record evidence and are\ntherefore sustainable.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 08-04624 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 28, 2009).\n\n3\nThe Board does not review a case de novo.  The favorable evidence cited by Applicant is not\nsufficient to demonstrate the Judge\u2019s decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g.,\nISCR Case No. 06-11172 at 3 (App. Bd. Sep. 4, 2007).  After reviewing the record, the Board\nconcludes that the Judge examined the relevant data and articulated a satisfactory explanation for\nhis decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.\u2019\u201d Motor\nVehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n of the United States v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983)\n(quoting Burlington Truck Lines, Inc. v. United States, 371 U.S. 156, 168 (1962)).  \u201cThe general\nstandard is that a clearance may be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests of the\nnational security.\u2019\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).

DeLaney, Esquire, Department Counsel \n \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n \nSeptember 16, 2009 \n \n______________ \n \nDECISION \n______________ \n \n \nROSS, Wilford H., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant submitted his Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-\nQIP), on May 22, 2008 (Item 5). On January 30, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns \nunder Guideline F concerning the Applicant. The action was taken under Executive Order \n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by President Bush on December 29, 2005, and \neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \nApplicant submitted an Answer to the SOR on February 17, 2009, and requested a \ndecision without a hearing. Department Counsel submitted a File of Relevant Material \n(FORM) to the Applicant on March 9, 2009. The Applicant received the FORM on March \n20, 2009, and was given 30 days to submit any additional information. He elected not to \nsubmit any additional information. The case was assigned to me on June 18, 2009.  Based \n \n \n1 \n \n\n \n \n2 \n \nupon a review of the case file, pleadings, and exhibits, eligibility for access to classified \ninformation is denied. \n \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nThe Applicant is 42 and married.  He is employed by a defense contractor and seeks \nto obtain a security clearance in connection with his employment. \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe Government alleges in this paragraph that the Applicant is ineligible for \nclearance because he is financially overextended and therefore at risk of having to engage \nin illegal acts to generate funds.  The Applicant admitted all of the allegations under this \nparagraph.  Those admissions are hereby deemed findings of fact.   \n \n1.a.  The Applicant admits that he is indebted to a collection agency in the amount of \n$11,046 for an automobile loan account. This debt has not been paid. \n \n1.b.  The Applicant admits that he is indebted to a collection agency in the amount of \n$209 for a utility bill. This debt has not been paid. \n \n1.c.  The Applicant admits that he is indebted to an automobile finance agency in the \namount of $10,000. This debt has not been paid. \n \n1.d.  The Applicant admits that he is indebted to a bank for a past due account in the \namount of $800.  This debt has not been paid. \n \n1.e.  The Applicant admits that he is indebted to a second bank for a past due \naccount in the amount of $800.  This debt has not been paid. \n \n \nPolicies \n \nSecurity clearance decisions are not made in a vacuum.  When evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the administrative judge must consider the \nrevised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief introductory explanations for each \nguideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating \nconditions, which are useful in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities \nof human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the \nadjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, \nimpartial and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a \nconscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The \n\n \n \n3 \n \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, past \nand present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.  In addition, the \nadministrative judge may also rely on his own common sense, as well as his knowledge of \nthe law, human nature, and the ways of the world, in making a reasoned decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to classified \ninformation will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Security clearance decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n  \nFinally, as emphasized by President Eisenhower in Section 7 of Executive Order \n10865, \u201cAny determination under this order . . . shall be a determination in terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to \nclassified or sensitive information).   \n \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set out \nin AG \u00b618:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \n\n \n \n4 \n \nclassified information. An individual who is financially overextended is at risk \nof having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under AG \n\u00b619(a), an \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts\u201d is potentially disqualifying.  Similarly \nunder AG \u00b619(c), \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d may raise security \nconcerns. The Applicant, by his own admission, has over $ 22,000 in past due debts, all of \nwhich have been due and owing for a considerable amount of time. The evidence is \nsufficient to raise these potentially disqualifying conditions. \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG \u00b6 20(a), the disqualifying condition \nmay be mitigated where \u201cthe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on \nthe individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d  AG \u00b6 20(b) states \nthat the disqualifying conditions may be mitigated where \u201cthe conditions that resulted in the \nfinancial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a \nbusiness downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and \nthe individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.\u201d  AG \u00b6 20(c) states that it may be \nmitigating where, \u201cthe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or \nthere are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control.\u201d AG \u00b6 \n20(d) states that it may be mitigating where, \u201cthe individual initiated a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.\u201d Finally, under AG \u00b6 20(e), it is \nmitigating where, \u201cthe individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented proof to \nsubstantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions to resolve the issue.\u201d   \n \nThe Applicant\u2019s Answer is bereft of any statements as to how any of the possible \nmitigating conditions apply to his case. There is no statement by the Applicant in the file in \nany form whatsoever. Simply put, it is the Applicant\u2019s burden to show that the mitigating \nconditions apply, and he has not met that burden. Based on all of the available evidence, I \ncannot find that the Applicant has mitigated the allegations under this Guideline.  Paragraph \n1 is found against the Applicant. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances.  Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether \nto grant eligibility for a security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment \nbased upon careful consideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. The \nadministrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 \n2(a) in making such a decision:  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \n\n \n \n5 \n \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n        \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case.  The Applicant has failed to pay any of his \ndelinquent debts. They remain due and owing and, accordingly, he has not mitigated the \nGovernment\u2019s concerns.  As set forth above, I cannot find that there have been permanent \nbehavioral changes under AG \u00b6 2(a)(6).  In addition, I find that there is the potential for \npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress (AG \u00b62(a)(8)), and that there is a likelihood of \nrecurrence (AG \u00b62(a)(9)).  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s \neligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude the \nApplicant has not mitigated the security concerns arising from his financial situation.   \n \nOn balance, it is concluded that the Applicant has not successfully overcome the \nGovernment's case opposing his request for a DoD security clearance.  Accordingly, the \nevidence supports a finding against the Applicant as to the factual and conclusionary \nallegations expressed in Paragraph 1 of the Government's Statement of Reasons.  \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST THE APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a. through 1.e.:  \nAgainst the Applicant \n \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

I kept the record open until September 18, 2009, to \nenable Applicant to submit additional documentary evidence. He timely submitted AX D \nthrough F. Department Counsel\u2019s response to AX D through F is attached to the record \nas Hearing Exhibit I. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on September 14, 2009. The \nrecord closed on September 18, 2009. \n \nAmendment of SOR \n \n \nOn my own motion and without objection from either party, I amended the SOR \nto insert Applicant\u2019s middle name, which was omitted from the SOR (Tr. 5). \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted all the factual allegations in the \nSOR. His admissions in his answer and at the hearing are incorporated in my findings of \nfact.  \n \n \nApplicant is a 44-year-old employee of a defense contractor, working in a \nshipyard (Tr. 34). He has worked for his current employer since March 2008. He served \non active duty in the U.S. Army from July 1983 to November 2003, retiring as a staff \nsergeant (GX 2). He received a security clearance in December 1983, while on active \nduty. He received a clearance as a contractor in 2005 (Tr. 12). He has worked on three \ndefense-related contracts since his retirement (Tr. 33).  \n \n \nApplicant was married in May 1987 and divorced in June 1992. He remarried in \nJune 1997 and was divorced in August 2004. He has three daughters, ages 21, 20, and \n11.  \n \n \nIn July 2001, Applicant and his then wife filed a joint Chapter 13 bankruptcy \npetition. When they divorced in August 2004, Applicant\u2019s ex-wife agreed to make no \nclaims for a share of his military retired pay, and she agreed to make the payments to \nthe bankruptcy trustee, because most of the debts included in the bankruptcy were \nhers. She failed to make the payments as agreed, resulting in the bankruptcy being \ndismissed in April 2006 (Tr. 44-45; GX 1 at 28; GX 7 at 4). The bankruptcy is alleged in \nSOR \u00b6 1.w. \n \n \nIn January 2002, Applicant was arrested for a bad check offense, pleaded nolo \ncontendere, and was sentenced to probation for 30 days. In May 2002, he was arrested \nfor a bad check offense, pleaded nolo contendere, and was sentenced to probation for \n12 months (GX 3). \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \n \nApplicant was given partial custody of his youngest daughter in 2007. He quit \none of his two jobs to take care of his daughter, and he fell behind on his monthly \ninstallment payments (GX 5 at 1-3). \n \n \nIn February 2009, Applicant hired a \u201ccredit repair and restoration\u201d expert. (GX 7 \nat 7-8). He terminated the relationship when the expert stopped taking his calls (Tr. 49). \n \n \nIn March 2009, Applicant submitted a personal financial statement in response to \nDOHA interrogatories. He reported monthly net income of $2,749, expenses of $2,031, \ndebt payments of $960, and a net monthly remainder of $718. He inadvertently listed \nhis child support payments of $360 twice and neglected to include his car payments of \n$600. It appears that the actual net remainder should have been listed as $118 (GX 7 at \n5).  \n \n \nIn August 2009, Applicant contacted a credit counseling agency (AX B). On \nSeptember 9, 2009, one week after the hearing, he agreed to a payment schedule, \nmanaged by the credit counseling agency, for the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.i, 1.k, \nand 1.m. The agency recomputed his monthly expenses to be $3,244, and it suggested \nways he could reduce his monthly expenses from $3,244 to $2,867 (AX E). The \nagency\u2019s computation of expenses would result in a monthly shortfall of about $118 \nunless Applicant\u2019s net income increased from the amount reported in his March 2009 \npersonal financial statement. \n  \n \nApplicant was unable to work for the three weeks preceding the hearing due to a \nwork-related injury (AX C). His pay was reduced from $700 a week to $300 a week \nduring this period of disability (Tr. 37). He expected to return to full pay in mid-\nSeptember and to work four hours of overtime every day on a ship undergoing overhaul \n(Tr. 50).  \n \n \nThe table below summarizes the evidence concerning the delinquent debts \nalleged in the SOR. \n \nSOR Debt \nAmount \nStatus \nEvidence \n1.a \nJudgment \n$782 \nPayment plan \nAX E at 6; Tr. 35 \n1.b \nCell phone \n$409 \nPaid Sep 09 \nAX A at 1; Tr. 35-36 \n1.c \nBank loan \n$995 \nNot included in \npayment plan; will start \npayments in Dec 09 \nTr. 36 \n1.d \nUtility \n$269 \nNot included in \npayment plan; will start \npayments in Nov 09 \nTr. 36 \n1.e \nCredit card \n$611 \nNot included in \npayment plan; will start \npayments in Oct 09 \nTr. 39 \n1.f \nCable \n$262 \nUnresolved \nTr. 40 \n1.g \nCable \n$191 \nUnpaid \nTr. 40 \n\n \n4 \n \n \n1.h \nUnemployment \noverpayment \n$316 \nUnpaid \nTr. 40 \n1.i \nLoan \n$2,591 \nPayment plan \nAX E at 6 \n1.j \nJewelry \n$2,525 \nUnpaid \nTr. 41 \n1.k \nCell phone \n$486 \nPayment plan \nAX E at 6 \n1.l \nUtility \n$53 \nPaid Jul 09 \nAX A at 1 \n1.m \nJewelry \n$1,970 \nPayment plan \n \n1.n \nBad check \n$576 \nUnpaid \nTr. 42-43 \n1.o \nBad check \n$66 \nPaid Jul 09 \nAX A at 1 \n1.p \nBad check \n$51 \nPaid Jul 09 \nAX A at 1 \n1.q \nBad check \n$55 \nPaid Jul 09 \nAX A at 1 \n1.r \nCollection \n$570 \nUnpaid \nTr. 43 \n1.s \nCredit card \n$441 \nUnpaid \nTr. 43 \n1.t \nCredit card \n$1,198 \nTo be combined with \npayments on 1.e \nTr. 43 \n1.u \nCollection \n$176 \nDuplicate of 1.e \nTr. 45 \n1.v \nCar insurance \n$94 \nPaid \nAX A at 2 \n \nPolicies \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.   \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not \ninflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. \nOr. 10865 \u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is not necessarily a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  It is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \n \n \nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).   \n \n \nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity \nclearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 \nU.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18 as follows:  \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds. \n \n \nSeveral disqualifying conditions under this guideline are relevant. AG \u00b6 19(a) is \nraised by an \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts.\u201d AG \u00b6 19(c) is raised by \u201ca \nhistory of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d AG \u00b6 19(e) is raised by \u201cconsistent \nspending beyond one=s means, which may be indicated by excessive indebtedness, \nsignificant negative cash flow, high debt-to-income ratio, and/or other financial analysis.\u201d \nApplicant\u2019s financial history raises all three disqualifying conditions, shifting the burden \nto him to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An \n\n \n6 \n \n \napplicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, and the burden of disproving \nit never shifts to the government. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, \n2005).  \n \n \nThe evidence indicates that the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e and 1.u are \nduplicates. When the same conduct is alleged twice in the SOR under the same \nguideline, one of the duplicative allegations should be resolved in Applicant=s favor. See \nISCR Case No. 03-04704 (App. Bd. Sep. 21, 2005) at 3 (same debt alleged twice). I will \nresolve SOR \u00b6 1.u in Applicant\u2019s favor.  \n \n \nSecurity concerns based on financial problems can be mitigated by showing that \n\u201cthe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual=s \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d AG \u00b6 20(a). This mitigating \ncondition is not established because Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts are numerous, not yet \nresolved, and did not arise from circumstances unlikely to recur. \n \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing that \u2018the \nconditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person=s \ncontrol (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical \nemergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual acted responsibly \nunder the circumstances.\u201d AG \u00b6 20(b). Applicant has encountered circumstances \nbeyond his control, i.e., periods of unemployment or underemployment and a divorce, \nbut he has not acted responsibly. He took no significant actions to resolve his debts until \nJuly 2009, after he received the SOR. He did not finalize his payment plan until after the \nhearing. I conclude AG \u00b6 20(b) is not established. \n \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing that \u201cthe \nperson has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear \nindications that the problem is being resolved or is under control.\u201d AG \u00b6 20(c). Applicant \nhas received counseling, but insufficient time has passed for him to establish a track \nrecord of responsible behavior. The evidence falls short of the \u201cclear indications\u201d \nrequired to establish this mitigating condition. \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing that \u201cthe \nindividual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve \ndebts.\u201d AG \u00b6 20(d). Good faith means acting in a way that shows reasonableness, \nprudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation. ISCR Case No. 99-0201, 1999 \nWL 1442346 at *4 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 1999).  Evidence of past irresponsibility is not \nmitigated by payment of debts only under pressure of qualifying for a security clearance.   \n \n \nAn applicant is not required, as a matter of law, to establish resolution of each \nand every debt alleged in the SOR. See ADP Case No. 06-18900 (App. Bd. Jun. 6, \n2008). An applicant need only establish a plan to resolve financial problems and take \nsignificant actions to implement the plan. ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. \nMay 21, 2008). There also is no requirement that an applicant make payments on all \n\n \n7 \n \n \ndelinquent debts simultaneously, nor is there a requirement that the debts alleged in the \nSOR be paid first. Id. \n \n \nAfter a long history of financial neglect, Applicant finally initiated a plan to resolve \nhis debts, but the catalyst for taking action was the SOR. Applicant was motivated \nprimarily by the threat to his job, not a sense of duty or obligation. I conclude that the \nelement of \u201cgood faith\u201d is not established by the evidence. \n \n \nApplicant cannot keep his job without a clearance, but the financial impact of \nlosing his clearance is not relevant. See ISCR Case No. 02-09220 (App. Bd. Sep. 28, \n2004). In his closing statement, he suggested the possibility of placing him on probation \nfor six months or a year. The Appeal Board has made it clear that administrative judges \ndo not have authority to grant conditional clearances. ISCR Case No. 99-0901, 2000 \nWL 288429 at *3 (App. Bd. Mar.1, 2000). See also ISCR Case No. 01-24328, 2003 WL \n21979745 at *2 (App. Bd. May 23, 2003).  \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the relevant circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline F in my whole person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 \n2(a) were addressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \n \n \nApplicant is a mature adult who served on active duty in the Army for 20 years. \nHe has held a clearance for most of his adult life, but he has not been attentive to his \npersonal obligations. The SOR appears to have convinced him to start working on his \nfinancial obligations. His track record, unfortunately, is one of inattention and neglect. \nHe appears to have a workable plan, but he has not yet begun to execute it.  \n \n \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline F, and \nevaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has \n\n \n8 \n \n \nnot mitigated the security concerns based on financial considerations. Accordingly, I \nconclude he has not carried his burden of showing that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant him eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): AGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.c-1.k: \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.l:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.m-1.n: \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.o-1.q: \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.r-1.t: \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.u-1.v: \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.w:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to \nclassified information is denied. \n \n \n \n \nLeRoy F. Foreman \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Eligibility for access to classified information is \ndenied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn September 23, 2008, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaires for \nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP). On February 5, 2010, the Defense Office of Hearings \nand Appeals (DOHA) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security \nconcerns under Guidelines F (financial considerations) and E (personal conduct). The \naction was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information \nwithin Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) effective within the \nDepartment of Defense for SORs after September 1, 2006.  \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on March 17, 2010. Department Counsel was \nprepared to proceed on April 21, 2010. The case was assigned to me on April 27, 2010. \n1 \n \nSeptember 27, 2010\n\n2 \n \nDOHA issued a notice of hearing on May 3, 2010, scheduling the hearing for May 18, \n2010. The hearing was held as scheduled. \n \nThe Government offered Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 5, which were \nreceived without objection. The Applicant offered Applicant Exhibits (AE) A through D, \nwhich were received without objection, and he testified on his own behalf. I held the \nrecord open until May 25, 2010, to afford the Applicant the opportunity to submit \nadditional evidence. Applicant did not submit additional evidence. DOHA received the \nhearing transcript (Tr.) on May 25, 2010.  \n \nProcedural Issue \n \nAmendment of SOR \n \n \nBefore the hearing, the Government moved to amend SOR \u00b6 2.a., clarifying the \nwording as follows: \n \nYou falsified material facts on an Electronic Questionnaires for \nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP), certified by you on about September \n23, 2008, in response to \u2018Section 27, Financial Record c. In the last \nseven years, have you had a lien placed against your property for failing to \npay taxes or other debts.\u2019 You answered \u201cno\u201d; whereas in truth, you \ndeliberately failed to disclose the tax liens  listed in subparagraphs 1.ll and \n1.mm, above.1 \n \nWithout objection from the Applicant, I granted the Government\u2019s request to amend \nSOR \u00b6 2.a. (Tr. 11-14.) \n \n \nAt the hearing, based on Applicant\u2019s testimony and evidence presented, the \nGovernment moved to amend the SOR further by adding the following additional \nallegation: \n \n1.yy. You failed to file your [name] state and federal tax returns as \nrequired for tax years 2006, 2007, 2008, and 2009.  \n \nAfter argument by both parties, I granted the Government\u2019s request to further amend \nand add SOR \u00b6 1.yy. Additionally, I gave the Applicant the opportunity to submit \nadditional material that would mitigate or rebut SOR \u00b6 1.yy., discussed supra. As noted, \nApplicant did not submit additional evidence. (Tr. 81-85.) \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant admitted SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. through 1.jj., 1.nn. through 1.qq., 1.ss. through \n1.xx., and stated in response to 2.a. and 2.b.

His admissions and denials were \naccompanied with explanations. His admissions are accepted as findings of fact. \n \nBackground Information \n \n \nApplicant is a 52-year-old owner of a security consultant company, who seeks a \nsecurity clearance to provide consulting services on a military installation. He held an \ninterim secret clearance from September 2008 to February 2010 until it was revoked as \na result of these proceedings. Without a clearance, Applicant is unable to bid or work on \nGovernment contract jobs. (Tr. 20-24.) Before becoming a consultant, Applicant was \nemployed for 21 years by a defense contractor at the same military installation where he \nhopes to provide consulting services. During those years, he held a security clearance. \n(Tr. 35, 39-40.)  \n \n \nApplicant graduated from high school in June 1976. He has no formal education \nbeyond high school. All his employment-related skills were acquired through on-the-job \ntraining. (Tr. 26.) Applicant married in October 1982. He and his wife have two children, \na 27-year-old son, and a 19-year-old son. Their older son lives on his own, and their \nyounger son lives at home. (GE 1, Tr. 24-26.)  \n \nFinancial Considerations \n \nApplicant\u2019s background investigation addressed his financial situation and \nincluded the review of his September 2008 e-QIP, his April 2009 Responses to DOHA \nInterrogatories, and his record of judgments and liens, as well as his October 2008 and \nOctober 2009 credit reports. Applicant\u2019s SOR identified 50 separate debts. (GE 1 \u2013 5.) \n \nApplicant\u2019s debts include a variety of creditors \u2013 46 medical bills; one utility bill; \none cell phone bill; one state tax lien for $5,947, filed in February 2003; and one federal \ntax lien for $10,998.74, filed in August 2005. The 50 debts alleged total $50,838. (SOR \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.a. \u2013 1.xx, Tr. 16.) Applicant contracted an illness in 2000, which was later \ndiagnosed as fibromyalgia. Apart from his tax debts, he attributes the majority of his \ndebts to uncovered medical bills. Before his hearing, Applicant submitted \ndocumentation reflecting that he made modest payments a medical debt creditor from \nNovember 2004 to March 2009. (Response to SOR.)  \n \nAt his hearing, he submitted documentation showing that he made a $50 and a \n$100 payment to the same medical debt creditor in April 2010; however, the same \ndocumentation reflected a balance of $27,035.53. His medical bills have been in a \ndelinquent status since 2003. (GE 4.) At his hearing, Applicant was unable to discuss or \nprovide meaningful information about the status of his delinquent medical bills. (AE C, \nAE D, Tr. 45-56, 78.) \n \nAdditionally, Applicant claimed the debt for a utility bill was paid, but offered no \ndocumentation to support his claim. (SOR \u00b61.kk.), Tr. 50.) He has not sought financial \ncounseling (Tr. 52.) Applicant submitted a letter from his accountant dated March 15, \n2010 stating he, \u201cis in the process of compiling and preparing [Applicant\u2019s] tax returns \n\n4 \n \n                                                          \nfor the periods of 2006 through 2009,\u201d and further indicated \u201c[w]e are working with the \nIRS to establish a payment plan to the outstanding liabilities.\u201d (Response to SOR.) \nApplicant\u2019s initial tax liability began in 2001 and has been ongoing. As of the hearing \ndate, Applicant had not resolved his state and federal tax arrearages; had not filed tax \nreturns for tax years 2006 through 2009; and the last time he filed a state or federal tax \nreturn was in 2005. (Tr. 56-69.)2 \n \nApplicant\u2019s personal financial statement completed in March 2009, reflects a joint \nnet monthly income of $3,325, with a monthly remainder of $590. (GE 3 at 83, Tr. 73-\n75.) He did not demonstrate through his documentation or testimony that he has \nmaintained any meaningful interaction with his creditors or that he has regained \nfinancial responsibility. In short, Applicant\u2019s financial situation has not improved in any \nsignificant way since his SOR was issued. \n \nPersonal Conduct \n \n \nIn September 2008, Applicant completed his e-QIP. He answered \u201cno\u201d to \nquestion 27 inquiring whether he had a lien placed against his property for failing to pay \ntaxes or other debts. He also answered \u201cno\u201d to question 28 inquiring whether he had \never been over 180 days delinquent on any debts in the last seven years, and whether \nhe was currently delinquent on any debts over 90 days. Both answers are clearly wrong. \n \nApplicant denies intending to falsify his clearance application. He explained that \nmedical debts did not \u201ccount or whatever\u201d when obtaining credit in the past. (Tr. 70-71.) \nHe acknowledged that he should have listed his tax liens on his e-QIP, but claimed he \ndid not know of their existence. (Tr. 71-72.) He acknowledged that he had completed \nsecurity clearance applications \u201cevery five or ten years\u201d and was experienced with the \nprocess. He further acknowledged that his signature page on his e-QIP certified the \ninformation he provided was true and accurate. (Tr. 69-70, 72-73.) I find neither claim \ncredible. Applicant was well versed and experienced in completing security clearance \napplications, so he was familiar with the forms and the process. The language of the \nquestions is straightforward. I do not find Applicant\u2019s explanation plausible given his \nsecurity clearance experience, the number of debts involved, and knowledge of his \nongoing tax problems. \n \nCharacter Evidence \n \nApplicant submitted a copy of his consulting agreement to work on base. (AE A.) \nHe also submitted 25 certificates recognizing his contributions and training received as \na defense contractor employee. These certificates were awarded to him during the \nyears he was employed on base, discussed supra. (AE B (1-25).) \n \n \n \n \n \n2 Applicant\u2019s testimony prompted Department Counsel to move to amend the SOR adding Applicant\u2019s \nfailure to file state and federal tax returns. See Amendment of SOR, supra. \n\n5 \n \nPolicies \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion for obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nof potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \n \n \n \n\n6 \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \n \nAG \u00b6 18 articulates the security concern pertaining to financial considerations:  \n \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 19 provides three financial considerations disqualifying conditions that \ncould raise a security concern and may be disqualifying in this case, \u201c(a) inability or \nunwillingness to satisfy debts,\u201d \u201c(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations,\u201d and \n\u201c(g) failure to file annual Federal, state, or local income tax returns as required or the \nfraudulent filing of the same.\u201d Applicant\u2019s history of delinquent debt and failure to file tax \nreturns is established by his admissions and the evidence presented. The Government \nestablished the disqualifying conditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), 19(c), and 19(g).   \n \n  \nFive financial considerations mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a) through (e) \nare potentially applicable:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control; \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \n\n7 \n \n                                                          \nApplicant\u2019s conduct does not warrant application of AG \u00b6 20(a) because there is \nmore than one delinquent debt and his financial problems are not isolated. Therefore, \nhis debts are a \u201ccontinuing course of conduct\u201d under the Appeal Board\u2019s jurisprudence. \nSee ISCR Case No. 07-11814 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 29, 2008) (citing ISCR Case No. 01-\n03695 (App. Bd. Oct. 16, 2002)). Applicant receives only partial credit under AG \u00b6 20(b). \nHis past medical problems no doubt contributed to his financial difficulties; however, his \nmodest efforts to resolve his medical debts are insufficient to fully mitigate concerns. \nFurthermore, there is no convincing evidence that his medical problems precluded him \nfrom paying his taxes or from filing his state and federal income tax returns from 2006 to \n2009.   \n \nApplicant remains heavily leveraged with no apparent plan to regain financial \nresponsibility. Considering his conduct in the aggregate, his actions do not show that he \nacted responsibly under the circumstances.3 The remaining mitigating conditions under \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 20(c) through (e) are not applicable. Applicant did not receive financial \ncounseling, he did not initiate a good-faith effort to repay his creditors or otherwise \nresolve his debts, nor did he demonstrate through documented efforts that he had a \nreasonable basis to dispute any past-due debts. \n \nPersonal Conduct \n \nAG \u00b6 15 articulates the security concern pertaining to personal conduct: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \nAG \u00b6 16 describes two conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; and \n \n3\u201cEven if Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances outside \nhis [or her] control, the Judge could still consider whether Applicant has since acted in a reasonable \nmanner when dealing with those financial difficulties.\u201d ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. Bd. Jan. \n12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 at 4 \n(App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). A component of the \nanalysis is whether Applicant maintained contact with his creditors and attempted to negotiate partial \npayments to keep his debts current. \n \n\n8 \n \n                                                          \n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information concerning \nrelevant facts to an employer, investigator, security official, competent \nmedical authority, or other official government representative. \n \nApplicant failed to disclose his state and federal tax liens, his current debts over 90 days \nand past debts over 180 days delinquent when completing his September 2008 e-QIP. \nThe Government established through the evidence presented the disqualifying \nconditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(a) and 16(b).4 \n \nAG \u00b6 17 provides seven conditions that could potentially mitigate security \nconcerns about his personal conduct: \n \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was \ncaused or significantly contributed to by improper or inadequate advice of \nauthorized personnel or legal counsel advising or instructing the individual \nspecifically concerning the security clearance process. Upon being made \naware of the requirement to cooperate or provide the information, the \nindividual cooperated fully and truthfully; \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, \nor other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur; \n \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress;  \n \n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable \nreliability; and \n \n \n4Deliberate and materially false answers on a security clearance application violate 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001. \nThe Supreme Court defined \u201cmateriality\u201d in United States v. Gaudin, 515 U.S. 506, 512 (1995): as a \nstatement having a \u201cnatural tendency to influence, or [be] capable of influencing, the decision making \nbody to which it is addressed.\u201d See also United States v. McLaughlin, 386 F.3d 547, 553 (3d Cir. 2004). If \nApplicant had provided accurate answers on his security clearance applications, his accurate answers \nare capable of influencing the government to deny his security clearance. His failure to disclose financial \nproblems are sufficiently serious to potentially jeopardize approval of his security clearance. Making a \nfalse statement under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001 is a serious crime, a felony (the maximum potential sentence \nincludes confinement for five years and a $10,000 fine).  \n\n9 \n \n                                                          \n(g) association with persons involved in criminal activity has ceased or \noccurs under circumstances that do not cast doubt upon the individual's \nreliability, trustworthiness, judgment, or willingness to comply with rules \nand regulations. \n \nNone of the mitigating conditions fully apply. Applicant does receive some credit \nfor later acknowledging that he should have answered these questions affirmatively \nwhen responding to the SOR. However, his rather qualified response is not enough to \novercome his willful misrepresentation of his true financial situation.5 His own evidence \ndemonstrates the existence of his substantial medical debt. He was no neophyte to the \nsecurity clearance process \u2013 he had over 21 years of experience as a defense \ncontractor employee and previously held clearances in that capacity. He knowingly and \ndeliberately chose not to disclose complete and accurate information regarding his \nunfavorable financial history.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n \n5The Appeal Board has cogently explained the process for analyzing falsification cases, stating:\n \n(a) when a falsification allegation is controverted, Department Counsel has the burden of \nproving falsification; (b) proof of an omission, standing alone, does not establish or prove \nan applicant\u2019s intent or state of mind when the omission occurred; and (c) a Judge must \nconsider the record evidence as a whole to determine whether there is direct or \ncircumstantial evidence concerning the applicant\u2019s intent or state of mind at the time the \nomission occurred. [Moreover], it was legally permissible for the Judge to conclude \nDepartment Counsel had established a prima facie case under Guideline E and the \nburden of persuasion had shifted to the applicant to present evidence to explain the \nomission.  \n \nISCR Case No. 03-10380 at 5 (App. Bd. Jan. 6, 2006) (citing ISCR Case No. 02-23133 (App. Bd. June 9, \n2004)).  \n\n10 \n \nThe comments in the Analysis section of this decision are incorporated in the \nwhole-person concept analysis. Applicant\u2019s lack of financial responsibility began in \napproximately 2000 and has been ongoing. His deliberate falsifications, if relied upon, \ncould have adversely affected or influenced the security clearance adjudication process \nto the detriment of the Government.  \n \nApplicant receives credit for 21 years of service as a Government contract \nemployee. His work while working for a Government contractor is excellent, and aside \nfrom the SOR allegations no other disciplinary or security-related problems surfaced. \nHis record of good employment weighs in his favor. There is a dichotomy between how \nApplicant handled his financial affairs and his past work-related performance.  \n \n  \nApplicant\u2019s deliberate failure to disclose information on his security clearance \napplication is serious, recent, and not mitigated. As such, I have concerns about his \ncurrent ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. After weighing \nthe disqualifying and mitigating conditions, and all the facts and circumstances, in the \ncontext of the whole-person, I conclude he has not mitigated security concerns \npertaining to financial considerations and personal conduct.  \n \nI take this position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518 (1988), my \u201ccareful consideration of the whole person factors\u201d and \nsupporting evidence, my application of the pertinent factors under the Adjudicative \nProcess, and my interpretation of my responsibilities under the Guidelines. Applicant \nhas failed to mitigate or overcome the Government\u2019s case. For the reasons stated, I \nconclude he is not eligible for access to classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a. \u2013 1.yy.: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n  \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a. - 2.b.: \n \nAgainst Applicant  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n11 \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue eligibility for a security \nclearance for Applicant. Clearance is denied. \n \n \n \n____________________________ \nROBERT J. TUIDER \nAdministrative Judge \n \n \n \n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is a 38-year-old senior staff software engineer for a defense contractor who seeks a security clearance. The allegations covered in the SOR and admitted by Applicant are adopted as relevant and material findings. Additional findings follow. Applicant\u2019s background Applicant married his wife in June 1997 (ex. 1). His wife was born and raised in Brazil to the parents of Brazilian parents. She was naturalized as a U.S. citizen in November 2006 (see ex. 1; Tr. 24, 44). Applicant and his wife have two children: ages five and two (see ex. 1). Applicant graduated from a highly regarded American university in June 1994 with a bachelor\u2019s of science degree in electrical engineering (ex. 1). Following his graduation, he was employed by a large computer maker as a software engineer, specializing in FAA-related issues (Tr. 22, 37). Applicant\u2019s firm was later absorbed by a major defense firm (see ex. 1; Tr. 35). Applicant met his wife in 1994 at a local U.S. community college where she was attending college on her father\u2019s diplomatic visa (Tr. 22). Her father is a high-ranking officer in the Brazilian Army. He was in the U.S. at the time as a part of an educational exchange program operated by DoD (Tr. 23-24).

The\ncase was assigned to me on June 17, 2009, and was scheduled for hearing on June 30,\n2009.  A hearing was held on the scheduled date for the purpose of considering whether\nit would be clearly consistent with the national interest to grant, continue, deny, or revoke\nApplicant\u2019s security clearance. At the hearing, the Government's case consisted of two\nexhibits (ex.); Applicant relied on one witness (himself) and one exhibit.  The transcript\nSeptember 30, 2009\n\n2\n(Tr.) was received on July 9, 2009.  Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings,\nexhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access classified information is granted.\nSummary of Pleadings\nUnder Guideline B, the SOR alleges that Applicant: (a) has a spouse and\ndaughter who are dual citizens of the U.S. and Brazil and reside in Brazil, (b) has a\nmother-in-law who is a dual citizen of Brazil and Portugal and resides in Brazil, (c) has a\nfather-in-law who is a dual citizen of Brazil and Portugal and resides in Brazil, and (d)\nhas a father-in-law who is a high-ranking officer in the Brazilian Army.\nFor his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted most of the allegations.  He denied\nthat his wife and daughter reside in Brazil.  \n      \nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 38-year-old senior staff software engineer for a defense contractor\nwho seeks a security clearance.  The allegations covered in the SOR and admitted by\nApplicant are adopted as relevant and material findings.  Additional findings follow.\nApplicant\u2019s background\nApplicant married his wife in June 1997 (ex. 1).  His wife was born and raised in\nBrazil to the parents of Brazilian parents.  She was naturalized as a U.S. citizen in\nNovember 2006 (see ex. 1; Tr. 24, 44).  Applicant and his wife have two children: ages\nfive and two (see ex. 1).\nApplicant graduated from a highly regarded American university in June 1994 with\na bachelor\u2019s of science degree in electrical engineering (ex. 1).  Following his graduation,\nhe was employed by a large computer maker as a software engineer, specializing in\nFAA-related issues (Tr. 22, 37).  Applicant\u2019s firm was later absorbed by a major defense\nfirm (see ex. 1; Tr. 35).\nApplicant met his wife in 1994 at a local U.S. community college where she was\nattending college on her father\u2019s diplomatic visa (Tr. 22).  Her father is a high-ranking\nofficer in the Brazilian Army.  He was in the U.S. at the time as a part of an educational\nexchange program operated by DoD (Tr. 23-24).  Before accompanying her father to the\nU.S. on his exchange program, she earned a  bachelor\u2019s of science degree in nutrition in\nBrazil. \nFollowing her father\u2019s return to Brazil, Applicant\u2019s then-girlfriend remained behind\nin the U.S. to continue her schooling and relationship she had established with Applicant.\nEventually, she earned a another bachelor\u2019s degree in nutrition from an American\nuniversity.\n\n3\n After they were married, Applicant and his wife purchased a home in March 1998.\nIn December 1998, they traveled to Brazil to attend a family-arranged church wedding\n(Tr. 24).\nNeither Applicant nor his wife discuss their business with her father.  Her father, in\nturn, has never discussed his military work with Applicant (Tr. 25).  Essentially, Applicant\nand his wife\u2019s father have a relationship that does not include any discussion of each\nother\u2019s work and business (Tr. 25-26).  For additional safety precautions, Applicant never\ndiscusses his business with his wife.  He confines his  work-related conversations with\nhis wife to work and travel schedules (Tr. 83-85).\nSince their marriage in 1997, Applicant has made several family-related trips to\nBrazil.  On these trips, he has never engaged in any business-related conversations with\nhis father-in-law.  When Applicant travels to Brazil, his wife and two children accompany\nhim. \nApplicant\u2019s naturalized father currently resides in the Netherlands.  He became a\nU.S. citizen in 1971 (Tr. 32)., and pursued his post-graduate studies in the U.S. at a\nprestigious foreign business school (Tr. 73).  After working on projects throughout the\nworld for many years, he settled in the U.S. in 1999 (Tr. 33).  More recently, he moved\nback to the Netherlands.  Applicant\u2019s step-mother is a U.S. citizen who was born in the\nPhilippines (Tr.34).  She became a naturalized U.S. citizen after marrying his father, and\ncurrently resides in the U.S.  Applicant has no brothers or sisters (Tr. 35).\nBetween 1997 and 2006, Applicant was involved in a host of FAA-related projects\nfor his employer.  Most of these projects required a security clearance, which Applicant\nobtained in 2008 (see ex. 1; Tr. 37).  Beginning in 2006, he transferred his engineering\nskills to security-related projects with his same employer (Tr. 36-39).\nApplicant and his wife moved to his current state of residence in September 2006\nwith their five-year old daughter.  His mother-in-law visited them from time-to-time to help\nwith their daughter (Tr. 28).  After their second child arrived (in July 1998), his wife\ndeparted with the child for Brazil to reside with her parents for a short time (Tr. 28-29, 42-\n43).  While living in Brazil, his wife applied for Brazilian citizenship on behalf of their\ndaughter (Tr. 44-45).  She did this to preserve their daughter\u2019s opportunity to become a\nBrazilian citizen at some future time, should she choose to do so  (Tr. 45-46).  She\nreceived Brazilian citizenship for their daughter in 2008 (Tr. 28-29, 44). \nMore recently, Applicant\u2019s father-in-law became a naturalized citizen of Portugal.\nHis wife\u2019s parents will likely retire to Portugal.  \nApplicant currently has little communication with his father-in-law (Tr. 26-27).\nBefore he returned to Brazil in 1997, Applicant occasionally saw him on his visits to the\nU.S. His father-in-law last visited his wife and their family in June 2008 (Tr. 49-50).\nApplicant has also had several opportunities to see his mother-in-law on her infrequent\nvisits to the U.S.  (Tr.  49).  \n\n4\nApplicant estimates to have made approximately nine trips to Brazil between 2000\nand 2006 to see his wife and her parents.  He made trips in 2000 (twice), 2002, 2005,\n2006 (twice), and 2008 (three altogether) (Tr. 50-57).  His Brazilian visits were always for\nthe sole purpose of seeing his wife and her family (Tr. 56). Since 2008, he has made one\ntrip to Brazil to see his wife and daughter (in February 2009), and he vacationed in Brazil\nwith his wife and children in April 2009 (see ex. A; Tr. 57).  \nApplicant\u2019s contacts with his in-laws have been exclusively face-to-face (see ex.\n2; Tr. 70-71).  His contacts have been limited to his family visits to Brazil and the few\noccasions when his in-laws came to his home in the U.S., with the last visit in June 2008\n(Tr. 70).  Applicant\u2019s conversations with his father-in-law never include discussions of his\nwork (Tr. 26).  His father-in-law knows the name of his employer, but nothing about the\nnature of his work (Tr. 61).\nApplicant\u2019s in-laws reside outside of the Brazilian capital city.  His father-in-law is\na high-ranking officer in the Brazilian Army (Tr. 58).  His father-in-law attended the top\nmilitary academy in Brazil for leadership training (Tr.58-59), and grew up in a relatively\nprivileged social setting.  His family once owned a factory. Eventually, they lost\neverything (Tr. 59).  His  father-in-law resided in military housing for most of his early\nmilitary career.  In the 1990s, he and his wife\u2019s mother bought a plot of land.  They built a\nhouse on this land and moved into the new home in 2000 (Tr. 60-61). Applicant\u2019s\nmother-in-law is a retired school teacher.\nApplicant assures that should his father-in-law ever inquire about his business, he\nwould follow his employer\u2019s strict reporting guidelines (Tr. 66-67).  These guidelines\nwould require Applicant to report any inquiries from his father-in-law through his\nemployer\u2019s established ethics chain of command, beginning with his facility security\nofficer (FSO) (Tr. 66-68).  \nApplicant has already advised his FSO of his father-in-law\u2019s status in the Brazilian\nArmy (Tr. 65-66).  Applicant is would report his father-in-law to his FSO were the father-\nin-law ever to be pressed by his father-in-law for business-related information (Tr. 64-\n65). He would report any Brazilian intelligence information passed on to him by his\nfather-in-law (Tr. 67-68).  \nApplicant is semi-fluent in Portuguese and knows a little French and Spanish (Tr.\n71).  While his work has been limited to projects requiring only a collateral security\nclearance, he could conceivably work on projects in the future that require a higher level\nof clearance (Tr. 85-86).  \nBrazil\u2019s country status\nBrazil remains a non-hostile trading partner of the U.S. and is a country whose\ndemocratic institutions are not incompatible with our own traditions and respect for\nhuman rights and the rule of law. Brazil maintains strong bilateral trading and commercial\nrelations with the U.S. and is a charter member of the Organization of American States.\n\n5\nSee Background Note: Brazil,  U.S. Department of State (2008).  Brazil is a country with\nno known recent history of government-sponsored hostage taking or disposition for\nexerting undue influence against family members to obtain either classified information,\nor unclassified economic and proprietary data (id.) \nPolicies\nThe revised AGs list guidelines to be considered by administrative judges in the\ndecision-making process covering DOHA cases. These guidelines require the\nadministrative judge to consider all of the \"Conditions that could raise a security concern\nand may be disqualifying\u201d (Disqualifying Conditions), if any, and all of the \"Mitigating\nConditions,\" if any, before deciding whether or not a security clearance should be\ngranted, continued or denied.  The Guidelines do not require the administrative judge to\nassess these factors exclusively in arriving at a decision.  In addition to the relevant\nAdjudicative Guidelines, administrative judges must take into account the pertinent\nconsiderations for assessing extenuation and mitigation set forth in \u00b6 E.2(a) of the\nrevised AGs, which are intended to assist the administrative judges in reaching a fair and\nimpartial commonsense decision.\nViewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following adjudication\npolicy concerns are pertinent herein:\nForeign Influence\nThe Concern: Foreign contacts and interests may be a security\nconcern if the individual has divided loyalties or foreign financial interests,\nmay be manipulated or induced to help a foreign person, group,\norganization, or government in a way that is not in U.S. interests, or is\nvulnerable to pressure or coercion by any foreign interest.  Adjudication\nunder the this Guideline can and should considered the identity of the\nforeign country in which the foreign contact or financial interest is located,\nincluding, but not limited to, such considerations as whether the foreign\ncountry is known to target United States citizens to obtain protected\ninformation and/or is associated with a risk of terrorism.  (AG), \u00b6 6.\nBurden of Proof\nUnder the Directive, a decision to grant or continue an Applicant's request for\nsecurity clearance may be made only upon a threshold finding that to do so is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest.  Because the Directive requires administrative\njudges to make a commonsense appraisal of the evidence accumulated in the record,\nthe ultimate determination of an applicant's eligibility for a security clearance depends,\nin large part, on the relevance and materiality of that evidence. As with all adversarial\nproceedings, the judge may draw only those inferences which have a reasonable and\nlogical basis from the evidence of record.  Conversely, the judge cannot draw factual\ninferences that are grounded on speculation or conjecture.\n\n6\nThe Government's initial burden is twofold: (1) It must prove any controverted\nfacts alleged in the SOR; and (2) it must demonstrate that the facts proven have a\nmaterial bearing to the applicant's eligibility to obtain or maintain a security clearance.\nThe required showing of material bearing, however, does not require the Government\nto affirmatively demonstrate that the applicant has actually mishandled or abused\nclassified information before it can deny or revoke a security clearance. Rather,\nconsideration must take account of cognizable risks that an applicant may deliberately\nor inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information.\nOnce the Government meets its initial burden of proof of establishing admitted\nor controverted facts, the burden of proof shifts to the applicant for the purpose of\nestablishing his or her security worthiness through evidence of refutation, extenuation\nor mitigation of the Government's case.  Because Executive Order 10865 requires that\nall security clearances be clearly consistent with the national interest, \u201csecurity-\nclearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d See\nDepartment of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988).\nAnalysis\nApplicant presents as a conscientious senior staff software engineer who\nmarried a Brazilian citizen who became a naturalized U.S. citizen following her\nmarriage to Applicant in February 1997.  Applicant and his wife have two children, one\nof whom became a naturalized dual citizen of Brazil. \nPrincipal security issues raised in this case center on Applicant\u2019s father-in-law\nwho is a dual citizen of Brazil and Portugal and a high-ranking officer in the Brazilian\nArmy.  Department Counsel raises security concerns over risks that Applicant\u2019s in-\nlaws (primarily his father-in-law) residing in Brazil might be subject to undue foreign\ninfluence by Brazilian government and military authorities to access classified\ninformation in Applicant\u2019s possession or control. \nBecause Applicant\u2019s in-laws (particularly his father-in-law) reside in Brazil, they\npresent potential heightened security risks covered by disqualifying condition (DC) \u00b6\n7(a), \u201ccontact with a foreign family member, business or professional associate, friend,\nor other person who is a citizen of or resident in a foreign country if that contact\ncreates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure,\nor coercion,\u201d of the guidelines for foreign influence. The citizenship/residence status of\nthese in-laws in Brazil pose some potential concerns for Applicant because of the risks\nof undue foreign influence that could compromise sensitive or classified information\nunder Applicant's possession and/or control. \nDue to the infrequency of the contacts (all face-to-face) Applicant has\nhistorically had with his in-laws, potential risks associated with his in-laws residing in\nBrazil are tempered considerably. Moreover, none of Applicant\u2019s in-laws have any\nidentified affiliations or contacts with Brazilian officers currently known to be\n\n7\nassociated with intelligence or military organizations interested in collecting proprietary\nor sensitive information in the U.S.\nFurther, from what is known from the presented evidence, none of Applicant\u2019s\nin-laws residing in Brazil have any known (a) political affiliations with Brazil\u2019s\ngovernment, (b) history to date of being subjected to any coercion or influence, or (c)\nor major indications of any vulnerability to the same.  Applicant\u2019s mother-in-law is a\nretired school teacher with no apparent political interests in Brazil or the U.S.  While\nhis father-in-law is a high-ranking officer in the Brazilian Army, he has shown no\ninterest in Applicant\u2019s  business and made no attempts to discuss his business and\nmilitary interests in Brazil or inquire of Applicant\u2019s business.  Applicant has already\nkept his FSO informed of his father-in-law\u2019s military status, and pledges to report any\nbusiness-related inquiries of his father-in-law in the future in compliance with his\nemployer\u2019s strict reporting guidelines. \nThe AGs governing collateral clearances do not dictate per se results or\nmandate particular outcomes for applicants with relatives who are citizens/residents of\nforeign countries in officer.  What is considered to be an acceptable risk in one foreign\ncountry may not be in another.  While foreign influence cases must by practical\nnecessity be weighed on a case-by-case basis, guidelines are available for\nreferencing in the supplied materials and country information about Brazil. \nUnlike the old AGs, the new ones explicitly take into account the country\u2019s\ndemonstrated relations with the U.S. as an important consideration in gauging whether\nthe particular relatives with citizenship and residency elsewhere create a heightened\nsecurity risk. The geopolitical aims and policies of the particular foreign regime\ninvolved do matter.  Brazil remains a friendly country of the U.S. with strong bilateral\ntrade and commercial relations, a good humans rights record, and historical respect\nfor the rule of law. \nAs for security concerns associated with the presence of Applicant's relatives in\nBrazil, any potential heightened risk of a hostage situation or undue foreign influence\nbrought in the hopes of eliciting either classified information or economic or proprietary\ndata out of Applicant through his in-laws residing in Brazil is quite remote.  Applicant,\naccordingly, may take partial advantage of one important mitigating condition: MC \u00b6\n8(a), \u201cthe nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which these\npersons are located, or the persons or activities of these persons in that country are\nsuch that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a position of having to choose\nbetween the interests of a foreign a foreign individual, group, organization, or\ngovernment and the interests of the U.S.\u201d \nMC \u00b6 (8(b), \u201cthere is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s\nsense of loyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country is\nso minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships and\nloyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any conflict of\ninterest in favor of the U.S. interest,\u201d has application, too, to Applicant\u2019s situation.\n\n8\nApplicant is a U.S. citizen by birth who has demonstrated loyalty, patriotism, and\nprofessional commitments to the U.S. throughout his life.  His wife is a naturalized\nU.S. citizen, and both of his children are U.S. citizens by birth.  And all of his financial\ninterests (home and retirement savings) are situated in the U.S.  Whatever potential\nconflicts he may have through his in-laws (primarily his father-in-law) who reside in\nBrazil are more than outweighed by Applicant\u2019s demonstrated U.S. citizenship\nresponsibilities.\nMC \u00b6 (8(e), \u201cthe individual has promptly complied with existing agency\nrequirements regarding the reporting of contacts, requests, or threats from persons,\ngroups, or organization from a foreign country,\u201d has some applicability as well to\nApplicant\u2019s situation.  He credibly assured that he advised his FSO of his father-in-\nlaw\u2019s military status and would report any further business-related contacts of her\nfather-in-law, should they occur.  Applicant has a considerable history of reliable and\ntrustworthy service to his defense contractor and the U.S. and merits acceptance of\nhis reporting commitments.\nWhole person assessment also serves to minimize Applicant\u2019s exposure to\nconflict of interests with his Brazilian in-laws.  Not only is Applicant a U.S. citizen by\nbirth with demonstrated loyalty, patriotism, and professional commitments to the U.S.,\nbut he has made every effort to keep his FSO informed of his father-in-law\u2019s military\nstatus in Brazil.  Any risks associated with Applicant\u2019s in-laws are clearly manageable\nones.  In Applicant\u2019s case, any likelihood of coercion, pressure, or influence being\nbrought to bear on any of his in-laws, spouse or children by Brazilian authorities is\nminimal. \nOverall, any potential security concerns attributable to Applicant's in-laws\nresiding in Brazil are sufficiently mitigated to permit safe predictive judgments about\nApplicant's ability to withstand risks of undue influence attributable to his familial\nrelationships in Brazil. Favorable conclusions warrant with respect to the allegations\ncovered by sub-paragraphs 1.a through 1.e of Guideline B.\nIn reaching my decision, I have considered the evidence as a whole, including\neach of the factors and conditions enumerated in E2(a) of the revised AGs.\n F   o  rmal Findings\nIn reviewing the allegations of the SOR in the context of the findings of fact,\nconclusions, and the factors and conditions listed above, I make the following\nseparate formal findings with respect to Applicant's eligibility for a security clearance.\nGUIDELINE B: (FOREIGN INFLUENCE):\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparas. 1.a through 1e:\n           \nFor Applicant\n\n9\nConclusions\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant's security\nclearance.

Applicant states that he has never told anyone in the\nPRC about his job duties in the United States.  He further states that his parents,\nbrothers and sister do no know which company he works for.     \nThe Applicant has traveled to the PRC in 2002, 2006, 2007 and 2008.  During his\ntrips to the PRC, in addition to visiting his family he had dinner with former classmates\nand neighbors that he has maintained contact with who are citizens and residents of the\nPRC.  He states that when he travels to the PRC in the future, he will not meet with his\nformer classmates and neighbors anymore.  Applicant has surrendered his foreign\npassport to his company security officer who has destroyed it.  (Government Exhibit 6).\nApplicant is married to a woman of Chinese heritage who has also become a\nnaturalized United States citizen.  They have a native born American child.  The\nApplicant enjoys the freedoms and opportunities afforded him in the United States and\nappreciates being a citizen of this country.    \nI have taken official notice of the following facts concerning the country of China. \nChina is a large and economically powerful country, with a population of over a billion\npeople and an economy growing at about 10% per year.  China is an authoritarian\ngovernment, dominated by the Chinese Communist Party.  In its 2007 annual report to\nCongress, the United Sates-China Economic and Security Review Commission noted\nthe following about China\u2019s intelligence gathering:\n\n3\nIn some cases, access to restricted technology is obtained by China through\nindustrial espionage; China operates an aggressive clandestine effort to acquire\nadditional technologies.\nIn recent years, this has become such a problem in the United\nStates that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials have\nrated China\u2019s espionage and industrial theft activities as the leading threat\nto the security of U. S. technology.\nMoreover, the FBI stepped up counter-intelligence efforts against\nChinese Intelligence operations in the United States in July 2007, because\nof what FBI Director Robert Muller called a \u201csubstantial concern\u201d about\nthose operations.  As Chinese espionage against the U.S. military and\nAmerican business continues to outpace the overwhelmed U.S.\ncounterintelligence community, critical American secrets and proprietary\ntechnologies are being transferred to the People\u2019s Liberation Army and\nChinese state-owned companies.  \nThe report also concludes that \u201cChinese espionage activities in the United States\nare so extensive that they comprise the single greatest risk to the security of United\nStates technologies.\u201d\nThe National Counterintelligence Executive has made similar findings, including\nthe fact that China continues to target United States military technologies.  Specifically,\nin its 2007 annual report to Congress, the National Counterintelligence Executive\nincluded the following passage in its findings:\nBusinessmen, scientists engineers, and academics as well as\nstate-run security services from a large number of countries continue to\ntarget US information and technology, according to information compiled\nduring the FY 2007 reporting period.  The bulk of the collection activity,\nhowever, comes from citizens of a core group of fewer than 10 countries,\nwhich include China. \nAccording to the Department of Defenses\u2019s Annual Report to Congress: Military\nPower of the People\u2019s Republic of China 2009: (1) China uses \u201cstate-sponsored\nindustrial espionage to increase the level of technologies available to support military\nresearch, development, and acquisition\u201d, (2) \u201cChina continues a systematic effort to\nobtain dual-use and military technologies from abroad through legal and illegal\ncommercial transactions\u201d, (3) China seeks to \u201cobtain sensitive U.S. technologies (e.g.\nmissile, imaging, semiconductor and submarine) illegally by targeting well-placed\nscientists and businessmen\u201d, and (4) China poses a \u201cthreat to national security due to\nChina\u2019s sustained efforts to obtain U.S. technology illegally.\u201d \nFurthermore, according to the State Department, China has a poor record with\nrespect to human rights, which includes: arbitrary or unlawful killings by security forces,\nphysical abuse and torture of prisoners, arbitrary arrest and detention, denial of fair\npublic trials, searches of premises without warrants, monitoring of communications\n(including telephone conversations, facsimile transmissions, e-mail, text messaging,\n\n4\nand internet communications) and opening domestic and international mail, failure to\nrespect freedom of speech and press, failure to respect academic and artistic freedom,\nsevere restrictions on peaceful assembly and associations, restrictions on freedom of\nassociation, restriction on the freedom of religion, and citizens lack the right to change\ntheir government peaceably, or change the laws and officials that govern them. \nPOLICIES\nSecurity clearance decisions are not made in a vacuum.  Accordingly, the\nDepartment of Defense, in Enclosure 2 of the 1992  Directive sets forth policy factors\nand conditions that could raise or mitigate a security concern; which must be given\nbinding consideration in making security clearance determinations.  These factors\nshould be followed in every case according to the pertinent criterion.  However, the\nconditions are neither automatically determinative of the decision in any case, nor can\nthey supersede the Administrative Judge\u2019s reliance on her own common sense.\nBecause each security clearance case presents its own unique facts and\ncircumstances, it cannot be assumed that these factors exhaust the realm of human\nexperience, or apply equally in every  case.  Based on the Findings of Fact set forth\nabove, the factors most applicable to the evaluation of this case are:\nForeign Influence\n6.  The Concern.  Foreign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the\nindividual has divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or\ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way that is not\nin U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by any foreign interest.\nAdjudication under this Guideline can and should consider the identity of the foreign\ncountry in which the foreign contact or financial interest is located, including, but not\nlimited to, such considerations as whether the foreign country is known to target United\nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a risk of\nterrorism. \nCondition that could raise a security concern:\n7. (a) contact with a foreign family member, business or professional associate,\nfriend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident of a foreign country if that contact\ncreates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or\ncoercion. \nConditions that could mitigate security concerns:\nNone.\nIn addition, as set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive at pages 16-17, in\nevaluating the relevance of an individual\u2019s conduct, the Administrative Judge should\nconsider the following general factors:\na.  The nature, extent and seriousness of the conduct;\n\n5\nb.  The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation;\n \nc.  The frequency and recency of the conduct;\nd.  The individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct;\ne.  The extent to which the participation is voluntary;\nf. The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavior\nchanges;\ng.  The motivation for the conduct; \nh. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress; and\n \ni.  The likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nThe eligibility criteria established in the DoD Directive identify personal\ncharacteristics and conduct which are reasonably related to the ultimate question,\nposed in Section 2 of Executive Order 10865, of whether it is \u201cclearly consistent with the\nnational interest\u201d to grant an Applicant\u2019s request for access to classified information.\nThe DoD Directive states, \u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a\nsufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the person is\neligible for a security clearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is\npredicated upon the individual meeting these personnel security guidelines.  The\nadjudicative process is the careful weighing of a number of variables known as the\nwhole person concept.  Available, reliable information about the person, past and\npresent, favorable and unfavorable should be considered in reaching a determination.\u201d \nThe Administrative Judge can draw only those inferences or conclusions that have\nreasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record.  The Judge cannot draw\ninferences or conclusions based on evidence which is speculative or conjectural in\nnature.  Finally, as emphasized by President Eisenhower in Executive Order 10865,\n\u201cAny determination under this order . . . shall be a determination in terms of the national\ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the Applicant\nconcerned.\u201d\nThe Government must make out a case under Guideline B (foreign influence)\nthat establishes doubt about a person's judgment, reliability and trustworthiness.  While\na rational connection, or nexus, must be shown between Applicant's adverse conduct\nand his ability to effectively safeguard classified information, with respect to sufficiency\nof proof of a rational connection, objective or direct evidence is not required.\nThen, the Applicant must remove that doubt with substantial evidence in\nrefutation, explanation, mitigation or extenuation, that demonstrates that the past\nadverse conduct, is unlikely to be repeated, and that the Applicant presently qualifies for\na security clearance.\n\n6\nAn individual who demonstrates a foreign influence and has foreign connections\nmay be prone to provide information or make decisions that are harmful to the interests\nof the United States.  The mere possession of a foreign passport raises legitimate\nquestions as to whether the Applicant can be counted upon to place the interests of the\nUnited States paramount to that of another nation. The Government must be able to\nplace a high degree of confidence in a security clearance holder to abide by all security\nrules and regulations, at all times and in all places.\nCONCLUSIONS\nHaving considered the evidence of record in light of the appropriate legal\nstandards and factors, and having assessed the Applicant's credibility based on the\nrecord, this Administrative Judge concludes that the Government has established its\ncase as to all allegations in the SOR.   \nThe evidence shows that the Applicant has close and continuing foreign family\nties in the PRC.  The Applicant\u2019s father, mother, brothers, sister, and mother-in-law are\ncitizens and residents of the PRC.  She communicates with her parents in the PRC\nseveral times a month by telephone.  A brother and a sister are employed for the county\ngovernment in the PRC.  The risk of this strong foreign family tie is heightened by the\nfact that the Applicant\u2019s siblings have connections to the Chinese government by virtue\nof their employment.  Furthermore, Applicant\u2019s recent frequent travel to the PRC, and\nfuture travel to the PRC, places her in a vulnerable position and subject to coercion,\nexploitation and/or pressure by the Chinese government.  It is also noted that the\ncurrent political situation in the PRC elevates the cause for concern in this case. China\nis the most active collector of sensitive and protected United States information and\ntechnology.  In this case, the possibilities are great that the Applicant may at some point\nbe placed in a position to be forced to choose between the interests of a foreign\nindividual, group organization, or government and the interests of the United States.       \n \nUnder Foreign Influence, Disqualifying Condition 7.(a) contact with a foreign\nfamily member, business or professional associate, friend, or other person who is a\ncitizen of or resident of a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of\nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion applies.  None of\nthe Mitigating Conditions apply.  In this case, Applicant\u2019s relationships and regular\ncontact with her immediate family in the PRC, and her former classmates and\nneighbors, and the fact that her two siblings are employed for the county government in\nthe PRC, creates a risk for foreign influence or exploitation. \nFurthermore, there is no evidence in support of mitigation under the whole\nperson analysis.  The Applicant has submitted no favorable recommendations or\nsufficient documentation to support security clearance eligibility.  I have considered the\n\u201cwhole person concept\u201d in evaluating the Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified\ninformation.  Under the particular facts of this case, the totality of the conduct set forth\nunder all of the guidelines viewed as a whole, support a whole person assessment of\npoor judgement, untrustworthiness, unreliability, a lack a candor, and an unwillingness\nto comply with rules and regulations, and/or other characteristics indicating that the\nperson may not properly safeguard classified information.\n\n7\n  \nThe evidence shows that the Applicant has a strong bond and affection with his\nforeign parents, siblings, former classmates and neighbors in the PRC, and that could\npotentially cause the Applicant to become subject to foreign exploitation, inducement,\nmanipulation, pressure, or coercion.  Therefore, there is a possibility of foreign influence\nthat exists that could create the potential for conduct resulting in the compromise of\nclassified information.  Thus, I find that the Applicant is vulnerable to foreign influence.\nAccordingly, I find against the Applicant under Guideline B (Foreign Influence).\nConsidering all the evidence, the Applicant has met the mitigating conditions of\nGuideline B of the adjudicative guidelines set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive.\nAccordingly, she has failed to meet his ultimate burden of persuasion under Guideline\nB.  \nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal Findings For or Against the Applicant on the allegations in the SOR, as\nrequired by Paragraph 25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive are:\nParagraph 1: Against the Applicant.\nSubpara.\n1.a.: Against the Applicant\nSubpara.\n1.b.: Against the Applicant\nSubpara.\n1.c.: Against the Applicant\nSubpara.\n1.d.: Against the Applicant\nSubpara.\n1.e.: Against the Applicant\nSubpara.\n1.f.: Against the Applicant\nSubpara.\n1.g.: Against the Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly\nconsistent with the national interests to grant or continue a security clearance for the\nApplicant.\nDarlene Lokey Anderson\nAdministrative Judge\n \n",

Administrative Judge:\nOn December 24, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under Guideline F\n(Financial Considerations).  Applicant timely answered the SOR, denied all allegations,\n1\nand requested a decision without a hearing.  DOHA assigned the case to me on\n2\nNovember 18, 2010. The record  in this case closed October 16, 2010, the day\n3\nApplicant\u2019s response to the FORM was due. Applicant responded to the FORM on\nOctober 20, 2010. The response was not forwarded with the case file and was not\nconsidered in my initial decision dated December 6, 2010. The response to FORM was\nDecember 17, 2010\n\nI received the complete file folder on December 14, 2010.\n      4\nApplicant noted on his SF 86 that the bankruptcy was filed in the amount of $175,000 to \u201crefute a\n      5\nfranchised operation.\u201d\n2\nforwarded to me by Department Counsel after my decision was issued. I received a\ncopy of the Response on Friday December 10, 2010.  Based on that information, I\n4\nwithdrew my decision on December 14, 2010. Department Counsel did not object to\nApplicant\u2019s untimely response, and I have considered Applicant\u2019s response to the\nFORM in this new decision. Based on the record in this case, Applicant\u2019s clearance is\ndenied.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 49-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He is attending\ncollege classes online to earn his undergraduate degree, which he will obtain soon.\n(Response to FORM) He is married, and has three children. Applicant served in the\nUnited States Coast Guard Reserve from 1979 until 1982. (Item 1) He has worked for\nhis current employer since April 2008. (Item 5)\nApplicant worked in the private sector for more than 20 years. He claims his\ncredit was \u201cgreat\u201d and allowed him to purchase several homes. Applicant notes that his\nfinancial trouble began after he purchased a franchise business in December 2001.\n(Response to FORM) He decided to pursue \u201chis dream of owning his own business\u201d\ninstead of relocating his family to another state where his current job had been\ntransferred. (Response to FORM) The business venture failed despite assurances he\nreceived from the company\u2019s financial advisor. Applicant spent his entire savings,\nretirement and other funds in the failed business. As a result, Applicant filed for Chapter\n13 bankruptcy in October 2003. Applicant states he filed a Chapter 13 bankruptcy for\ntwo reasons. He wanted to repay his creditors and to \u201cseparate himself from the\nfranchise.\u201d (Response to FORM)\nApplicant paid approximately $45,000 in payments under the bankruptcy plan by\n2005, but records show that he was still delinquent on his payments. In February 2005,\nApplicant requested the Court\u2019s permission to refinance his home. (Item 14) After\nreceiving approval, Applicant paid all filed and allowed bankruptcy claims in full. The\nbankruptcy was discharged on April 25, 2005.  (Item 14) \n5\nApplicant remained self-employed after the 2005 bankruptcy discharge. He\nnotes he was in the business of \u201crestoration services.\u201d He stated he began to feel\ncomfortable about his financial prospects. Applicant noted on his SF 86 that he traveled\nto the Caribbean on a seven day cruise for pleasure in May 2005. (Item 5) However, he\nexplains that as the \u201chousing troubles\u201d began because of the mortgage crisis, his\nbusiness suffered. (Response to FORM) At the time, Applicant\u2019s income from his\nbusiness was approximately $117,000. (Item 15) Applicant disclosed that in December\n2007, he was 90 days delinquent in his adjustable rate mortgage for approximately\n$46,000. (Item 5) His wife returned to work at the end of 2007, and he joined his current\n\n3\nemployment in April 2008. He does not plan to venture into another business.\n(Response to FORM) \nApplicant states his February 2008 Chapter 13 bankruptcy was \u201cfiled to stop a\nforeclosure on his personal residence.\u201d He explains that the bank would not work with\nhim on a payment plan and he required additional time to get his finances in order.\n(Response to FORM) He states that he is now in a \u201cloan modification trial period.\u201d (Item\n3) The mortgage company approved the modification but the terms have not been\nfinalized. (Item 8) In May 2008, Applicant was delinquent on his bankruptcy payment\nplan. (Item 15) In June 2008, Applicant modified his Chapter 13 payment plan. (Item\n15) In December 2008, the bankruptcy case was dismissed for failure to make plan\npayments. (Item 15)\nApplicant explains he is now working with another bank because the loan was\nsold before the conversion took place. As of October 20, 2010, he is working with\nanother bank to fulfill terms of a modification plan. He states he continues to make all\npayments on time during this transition. (Response to FORM)\nThe SOR alleges, and Government exhibits substantiate, nine delinquent debts\nfor unpaid credit card accounts totaling $44,000. In addition, the 2003 chapter 13\nbankruptcy was noted and the January 2008, Chapter 13 bankruptcy filing was\nincluded. (Item 15) Applicant\u2019s debts alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.h, 1.i, 1j, and 1.k were\nresolved in his Chapter 13 bankruptcy in 2003. Applicant denies any knowledge of or\nresponsibility for the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d, 1.e, and 1.f. Applicant claims he paid\nthe debts alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.c and 1.f. Applicant did not present any documentation to\nsubstantiate his claims regarding any payments or formal disputes concerning these\ndebts. Applicant notes that his current delinquent debt for the above remaining SOR\nallegations is approximately $4,156. He also notes that they are still listed on his credit\nreport. (Response to FORM)\nApplicant states the items could not be legitimate because he has not been\ncontacted by anyone. He believes the two medical charges are not his because he has\nlived at his current residence for ten years and has never been contacted by anyone\nabout the issue. Furthermore, he states that $138 would not \u201cdrive him to a life of\ncrime.\u201d He just believes they are erroneous items. (Response to FORM) The allegation\nfor one month\u2019s rent from his previous business for $825 is not valid according to\nApplicant because he \u201cfulfilled the terms of the rental agreement\u201d and explained this to\nthe collection agent two years ago when he was contacted about the debt. He further\nnotes that if it was legitimate, they would have contacted him again. He believes it just\nhas not been removed from his credit report. (Response to FORM)\nApplicant asserts his \u201creliance on the financial services of the court\u201d will not\noccur again. He points to his current employment with a defense contractor and to the\nfact that he is completing his undergraduate degree in Information Technology.\nHowever, he has various student loans that are now in deferment. (Item 9) In sum, he\nstates that he was financially sound before he ventured into self-employment and he\n\nSee, Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988).\n      6\n\u00b619(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; (c) a history of not meeting financial obligations;\n      7\n4\nhas no plans to return to self-employment. He states that he has no credit cards or car\nloans and pays for everything in cash. (Response to FORM)\nApplicant failed to submit evidence and documentation to support his claims of\nmitigation concerning his efforts. He has failed to meet his burden.\n.\nPolicies\nThe adjudicative guidelines (AG) list factors to evaluate a person\u2019s suitability for\naccess to classified information. Administrative judges must assess disqualifying and\nmitigating conditions under each issue fairly raised by the facts and situation presented.\nEach decision must also reflect a fair, impartial, and commonsense assessment of the\nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2(a). Any one disqualifying or mitigating condition is not, by itself,\nconclusive. However, specific adjudicative guidelines should be followed where a case\ncan be measured against them, as they represent policy guidance governing access to\nclassified information. Considering the SOR allegations and the evidence as a whole,\nthe relevant adjudicative guideline is Guideline F (Financial Considerations).\nSecurity clearance decisions resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s security clearance. The Government\nmust prove, by substantial evidence, controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If it does,\nthe burden shifts to applicant to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the Government\u2019s case.\nBecause no one has a right to a security clearance, the applicant bears a heavy burden\nof persuasion.\nPersons with access to classified information enter into a fiduciary relationship\nwith the Government based on trust and confidence. Therefore, the Government has a\ncompelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the required judgement,\nreliability, and trustworthiness of those who must protect national interests as their own.\nThe \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels deciding any\nreasonable doubt about an Applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the\nGovernment.   \n6\nAnalysis\nThe Government established a case for disqualification under Guideline F, and\nApplicant did not mitigate the security concerns. Applicant filed for Chapter 13\nbankruptcy in 2008 which has been dismissed. He also filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy\nin 2003. He has unresolved delinquent debts.7\nFiling bankruptcy is a legal remedy that released Applicant from the requirement\nto pay the majority of his debt. His 2003 bankruptcy gave him a fresh start. In 2008, he\nagain developed financial problems and filed for bankruptcy. It appears that Applicant\n\n5\ndoes not have his finances under control given the fact that he still has unresolved\ndelinquent debts. \nWhile a discharge in bankruptcy is intended to provide a person with a fresh start\nfinancially, it does not immunize an applicant\u2019s history of financial problems from being\nconsidered for its security significance. See, e.g., DISCR Case No. 87-1800 (February\n14, 1989) at p. 3 n.2 (\u201cAlthough bankruptcy may be a legal and legitimate way for an\napplicant to handle his financial problems, the Examiner must consider the possible\nsecurity implications of the history of financial debts and problems that led to the filing\nof the bankruptcy.\u201d)\nApplicant has not established that he suffered a business turndown or explained\nhow any turndown impacted him financially. He has not presented evidence that he has\nacted responsibly under the circumstances. Applicant has not provided any\ndocumentation to support his claim that some of the debts are in dispute or that he has\nmade any efforts to pay the remaining debts in the SOR. Applicant has been steadily\nemployed since 2008. However, the debts have not been resolved. There is no\nindication the financial problems will not recur despite the claims that Applicant makes.\nHe is working with a new bank to modify a loan but has provided no documentation to\nsupport the claim.

On June 18, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings \nand Appeals (DOHA) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security \nconcerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations). The action was taken under \nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February \n20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \n(Directive); and the revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President \non December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs \nissued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \nJanuary 22, 2010\n\n \n2 \n \n \n \nOn July 13, 2009, Applicant answered the SOR in writing and elected to have the \ncase decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. On September 25, 2009, \nDepartment Counsel prepared a File of Relevant Material (FORM) containing nine Items \nand mailed Applicant a complete copy on September 29, 2009. Applicant received the \nFORM on October 6, 2009, and had 30 days from its receipt to file objections and \nsubmit additional information. On or about October 20, 2009, Applicant submitted four \nexhibits to which Department Counsel had no objection. On or about November 13, \n2009, Applicant submitted another document without Department Counsel\u2019s objection. \nOn November 17, 2009, DOHA assigned the case to me. After receiving the file, I \nmarked Applicant\u2019s exhibits as AE A through E and entered them into the record. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn her Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the factual allegations contained in \nParagraphs 1.a and 1.b.   \n  \n \nApplicant is 46 years old and married to her second husband. She has been \nenrolled in college from April 2007 to the present. From February 2001 to December \n2001, she worked for the federal government as a mail assistant. She then obtained a \nposition with a federal contractor for whom she worked until September 2003. From \nOctober 2003 to September 2007, she owned a hair salon. After a six-month period of \nunemployment, she obtained a position with a private company. In September 2008, \nshe completed an e-QIP and started her current position as an administrative specialist \nwith a federal contractor. (Item 5.) \n \n \nIn October 2006, Applicant and her husband purchased a $554,000 home with a \nprimary mortgage of approximately $439,000 and a second mortgage for $115,000. \n(Item 8 at 13-14.) Credit bureau reports (CBR) dated September 2008 and June 2009 \nreport that both mortgages became delinquent in late 2007 or early 2008, and \napparently went into foreclosure.1 (Items 7; 8; 9.)  \n \n \n In her Answer, Applicant stated that she attempted to work with the mortgage \ncompany to modify the loans for several months after she closed her business in \nSeptember 2007 and was unemployed. A customer service representative advised her \nnot to pay the mortgages until the company sent her a loan modification. (Item 4.) \nAccording to a July 2009 letter from her lawyer, Applicant contacted him about \nmodifying her mortgages in November 2008. (Item 4.) He noted that Applicant\u2019s income \nand business were adversely affected by the economic downturn and her husband\u2019s \ninability to work for a period of time because of a knee injury. He affirmed that Applicant \nunsuccessfully attempted to work out a loan modification with the mortgagor. (Id.) After \n                                                          \n1Applicant did not disclose that her mortgages were delinquent in the September 2008 e-QIP. In \nher Answer to the SOR, she stated that she did not know they were delinquent because her husband paid \nthe family bills. (AE A.) Although the government did not raise a falsification security concern under the \nPersonal Conduct Guideline in the SOR, this information may be considered in the whole-person \nanalysis. \n  \n\n \n3 \n \n \nreviewing the file, he asserted that the lender engaged in \u201cpredatory and deceptive \nlending practices\u201d and \u201cplaced this borrower into a non-affordable loan putting them at \njeopardy of losing their home.\u201d (Id.) In January 2009, Applicant filed an Official Qualified \nWritten Request to restructure the two mortgages. (Item 6.) On August 27, 2009, \nApplicant executed a loan modification agreement, in which the second mortgage was \nreleased and merged into the first after she paid $1,000. (AE B.) The total mortgage \namount was modified to $535,700 and required three initial monthly payments of \n$4,129, beginning on September 6, 2009, and monthly payments of $3,218 thereafter. \n(Item 8.) Applicant submitted evidence that she made the first payment of $4,129 on \nAugust 31, 2009, and that the mortgage company released the second mortgage. (Item \n8, AE E.)      \n \n \nOn January 29, 2009, Applicant entered into an agreement with a credit \ncounseling service to consolidate $46,600 of debt, including her husband\u2019s credit card \nbills, through monthly payments of $1,192 beginning in February 2009. (Item 6.) \nApplicant\u2019s March 2009 family budget reflected a net monthly income of $8,040, \nexpenses of $2,540, a $4,700 mortgage payment, and the $1,192 debt repayment, \nleaving a negative $392. (Item 6.) The revised mortgage payment eliminates the \nnegative balance at the end of the month.   \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s student loans total approximately $28,641 and are deferred until \n2011. (Item 7 at 2; AE A.) In January 2008, she obtained a $4,250 student loan. \nBetween August and December 2008, she borrowed another $8,500.  \n \n \n \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant\u2019s two mortgage loans were past due debts and \nraised security concerns. The status of each debt is as follows: \n \n \n1. (\u00b6 1.a) noted that Applicant was $9,000 past due on the $115,000 second \nmortgage. This mortgage was satisfied and released in August 2009. This \ndebt is resolved.   \n \n2. (\u00b6 1.b) alleged that Applicant was $80,000 past due on the $439,000 first \nmortgage. This mortgage was modified and restructured at the end of August \n2009.  She presented evidence that she made the first required payment \nunder the new loan. The mortgage is being resolved. \n \n \nApplicant stated in her Answer that she does not believe that she is living above \nher means. She paid off two of her charge cards and consolidated her husband\u2019s credit \ncard debt through the credit counseling services.2 With the large reduction of her \nmonthly mortgage payment and her monthly monitoring of the family bills (instead of her \nhusband), she believes her finances are resolving. (AE A.) \n \n \n \n                                                          \n2The SOR does not raise any security concerns regarding her credit cards. \n\n \n4 \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC), which are \nuseful in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. According to Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions adverse to an \napplicant shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also Executive Order \n12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive \ninformation). \n \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concerns relating to the guideline for financial considerations are set \nout in AG & 18:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nAG & 19 sets forth two conditions that could raise a security concern and be \npotentially disqualifying in this case: \n \n(a) an inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \n \nAfter closing her business in September 2007, Applicant was unable to resolve \nher delinquent mortgages until August 2009. The evidence is sufficient to raise these \ndisqualifying conditions.  \n \nAG \u00b6 20 includes six conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nunder this guideline, three of which may be applicable in this case: \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control; and, \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts. \n \nApplicant closed her business in September 2007 and was unemployed for six \nmonths. According to her attorney, she experienced financial problems as a \nconsequence of the poor economic climate and her husband\u2019s knee injury. Those \ncircumstances were conditions beyond her control. Sometime in 2008, she attempted to \nrenegotiate her mortgages, but ultimately needed to hire a lawyer in November 2008 \n\n \n6 \n \n \n(albeit after completing an e-QIP) after her individual attempts failed. However, within \ntwo months of closing her business and becoming unemployed, she decided to attend \ncollege and assumed additional debt of approximately $13,000 of student loans, which \nwas a decision within her control. Thus, AG \u00b6 20(b) has limited application. Applicant \nobtained credit counseling and entered into a repayment plan for debts not included in \nthe SOR in January 2009. The $1,192 monthly repayment is included in her budget. Her \nnew loan modification agreement reduced her monthly mortgage payment from the \nMarch 2009 amount of $4,700 to $4,129 through November 2009; thereafter, it will be \nreduced to $3,218, giving her a remainder of $1,400 in her budget. This amount should \nbe sufficient to manage payments on her student loan, which becomes due in 2011. \nThese actions warrant an application of AG & 20(c) and AG & 20(d) because they \nindicate that the mortgages are being paid and resolved through her good-faith efforts to \nmodify the loans.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a). They include the following:  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is a 46-year-old woman, \nwho has worked for a defense contractor for the past year. She and her husband were \nunable to pay their two mortgages after Applicant\u2019s business closed in September 2007 \nand she became unemployed for six months. The current economic downturn and her \nhusband\u2019s injury further exacerbated the problem. She attempted to renegotiate the \nloans, but was unable to do so without the assistance of a lawyer. Those loans were \nconsolidated in August 2009 and a lower monthly payment established. Based on \nApplicant\u2019s awareness of the effect that future financial problems could have on her \nemployment, along with her budget that is sufficient to pay her expenses, debts, and \nreduced mortgage payments, it is unlikely that similar financial problems will recur. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without concerns as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and \n\n \n7 \n \n \nsuitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant mitigated \nthe security concerns arising under financial considerations.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

On \nAugust 5, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued an SOR to \nApplicant, pursuant to Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information \nWithin Industry, dated February 20, 1960, as amended and modified; Department of \nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended and modified; and the revised \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005.  \n \nMarch 11, 2010\n\n \n2 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                           \nThe SOR alleged security concerns under Guidelines F (financial considerations) \nand E (personal conduct) (Hearing Exhibit (HE) 2). The SOR detailed reasons why \nDOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for \nApplicant. The SOR recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine \nwhether Applicant\u2019s clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked (HE 2). \n \nOn September 11, 2009, Applicant responded to the SOR (HE 3). On October \n21, 2009, Department Counsel indicated she was ready to proceed on his case. On \nNovember 3, 2009, DOHA assigned Applicant\u2019s case to me. On December 3, 2009, \nDOHA issued a hearing notice (HE 1). On January 4, 2010, Applicant\u2019s hearing was \nheld. At the hearing, Department Counsel offered seven exhibits (GE 1-7) (Tr. 13-14), \nand Applicant offered 17 exhibits (Tr. 14-17; AE A-Q). There were no objections, and I \nadmitted GE 1-7 (Tr. 14) and AE A-Q (Tr. 17). Additionally, I admitted the hearing \nnotice, SOR, and response to the SOR as hearing exhibits (HE 1-3). On January 7, \n2010, I received the transcript. I held the record open until January 25, 2010, to permit \nApplicant to provide additional documentation (Tr. 66). I granted an extension until \nFebruary 18, 2010 (HE 4, 5). After the hearing, I received two exhibits from Applicant \n(AE R (32 pages) and AE S (108 pages). Department Counsel did not object (HE 6), \nand AE R and S were admitted into evidence that same day.  \n \nFindings of Fact1 \n \nApplicant\u2019s SOR response admitted that he owed the creditors in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c, \n1.d, 1.e, 1.f, 1.g, 1.p, and 1.q (HE 3). He said some the debts he admitted were settled \n(HE 3). He denied some of the other SOR debts because they were paid, and denied \nother debts without explanation (HE 3). His admissions are accepted as findings of fact.   \n \nApplicant is 36 years old (Tr. 35). He is not married (Tr. 35). He has an eight-\nyear-old child (Tr. 35). He served on active duty in the U.S. Army from February 1993 to \nAugust 1995 (Tr. 26, 60). He left the Army early because of the drawdown (Tr. 60). He \nreceived an honorable discharge under reduction-in-force criteria (Tr. 26; AE E). When \nhe was discharged from the Army, he was an E-4 (Tr. 26). He has also served in the \nArmy Reserve (Tr. 26). He attended college from 2000 to 2005, with a brief break in \n2001 (Tr. 37). He is currently working for a contractor in Afghanistan (Tr. 37).   \n \nFinancial Considerations \n \nApplicant fell behind on his debts while he was attending college (Tr. 19). His \ndebts resulted from brief periods of unemployment and underemployment. In 2007, \nApplicant attempted to purchase a vehicle and discovered that he had some delinquent \ndebt (Tr. 20). He used his credit report to contact the creditors holding his delinquent \ndebts (Tr. 54-55). Some of the creditors on his credit report had transferred his accounts \nto different creditors (Tr. 55). Once he learned the creditor holding the account and the \n \n1Some details have not been included in order to protect Applicant\u2019s right to privacy. Specific \ninformation is available in the cited exhibits. \n\n \n3 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \namount owed, he began paying his debts (Tr. 54-55). On February 5, 2008, he paid a \nlaw firm that specializes in clearing delinquent debts and correcting credit reports \n$2,500 to assist with his financial issues (Tr. 55-56; AE R at 9). \n \nApplicant\u2019s monthly gross income is $14,166, and his net income is $12,200 (Tr. \n24; AE D). His monthly expenses total about $3,200 and his monthly debt payments \ntotal about $1,400 (AE D). His net remainder is about $7,600 (AE D). He currently has \n$10,000 in his checking account and $5,000 in his saving account (Tr. 23). He does not \nhave any credit cards, and his vehicle is in storage (Tr. 39). He does not have any \nutilities because the government provides utilities and many other expenses while he is \ndeployed overseas (Tr. 39).  \n \nThe SOR lists 18 debts totaling $29,075 with the following status: \n \na. $65\u2014DISPUTED; Applicant was aware that this debt was owed on a medical \naccount (Tr. 27). He thought it was held by the creditor in SOR \u00b6 1.b (Tr. 27). He was \nunable to locate the creditor and the credit reporting company was not able to give him \nany additional information on the creditor (Tr. 28, 40).  \n \nb. $1,123\u2014PAID. A December 24, 2009, letter from the creditor indicates this \nmedical account has been paid in full (AE H). \n    \nc. $3,157; d. $1,759; and e. $5,373\u2014PAYMENT PLAN. The creditor for three of \nhis student loan debts agreed on September 10, 2009, to accept a $9,310 lump sum \npayment to resolve these three debts (Tr. 28-29, 40-41; AE I). His checking account \nstatement showed a $5,000 student loan payment on January 21, 2010 (AE R at 4) and \na $3,000 payment on February 4, 2010 (AE S at 11). I was unable to locate \ndocumentation showing the remaining $1,310 was paid in the post-hearing \ndocumentation Applicant submitted. On December 23, 2009, Applicant sent a letter \ndisputing the continued listing of his student loans as delinquent accounts on his credit \nreport (AE S at 12). Applicant also has some non-SOR student loans totaling about \n$30,000, which are current (Tr. 41; AE D).     \n \nf. $823\u2014DISPUTED. Applicant disputed this debt and it was removed from his \ncredit report (Tr. 42; AE F).  \n \ng. $6,037\u2014PAID. On September 30, 2009, Applicant paid the creditor $3,938.90 \nto resolve this debt (Tr. 27, 42-43; AE G).  \n \nh. $650; and q. $1,820\u2014PAID. The debt in SOR \u00b6 1.h resulted from a late rent \npayment on his apartment (Tr. 51). The debt in SOR \u00b6 1.q resulted when Applicant \nbroke his lease on the same apartment (Tr. 52). In March 2004, the creditor in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.h and 1.q obtained two judgments (Tr. 51-52). On November 9, 2009, Applicant paid \n$2,000, and on November 16, 2009, Applicant paid $800, resolving these two debts (Tr. \n43; AE J).  \n \n\n \n4 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \ni. $1,158\u2014PAID. At his hearing, Applicant said the debt was paid (Tr. 43-44). \nThe debt was removed from his credit report (Tr. 43).  \n \nj. $365; and l. $614\u2014PAID. A February 14, 2009, letter from the creditor \nindicates the creditor was paid in full (Tr. 44-46; AE L). The debt has been removed \nfrom his credit report (Tr. 46). \n \nk. $236\u2014PAID. Applicant said he paid the debt (Tr. 45). A July 3, 2008, letter \nfrom TransUnion indicates the disputed debt does not appear on a current TransUnion \ncredit report (Tr. 44-45; AE M).   \n \nm. $255\u2014PAID. Applicant said the debt was paid, and it does not appear on his \ncurrent credit report (Tr. 46-47). \n \nn. $266\u2014DISPUTED. Applicant disputed the debt, and it was removed from his \ncredit report (Tr. 47). \n \no. $610\u2014PAID. An April 2, 2008, letter from the creditor indicates the debt was \nsettled in full and paid on March 31, 2008 (Tr. 47-48; AE P). \n \np. $764\u2014PAID. Applicant said the debt was paid; however, he did not have \ncorroborating documentation showing payment (Tr. 48). \n \nr. $4,000\u2014CURRENT. A court ordered Applicant to pay child support while he \nwas overseas, and he was unaware of the requirement (Tr. 35-36). His monthly child \nsupport payments are $385 (Tr. 36). Applicant\u2019s child support is current (Tr. 23, 35-37; \nAE Q).  \n \nFrom February 2008 to December 2009, Applicant sent numerous letters to his \ncreditors (AE S at 12-108). On some accounts he sent similar letters month after month \nasking for more information on accounts or objecting to continued listing of the negative \ncredit information in his credit reports (AE S at 12-108). \n \nIn sum, the government\u2019s most recent credit report was dated July 13, 2009 (GE \n6). It shows two delinquent medical accounts (SOR \u00b6 1.a ($65) and 1.b ($1,123)) (GE \n6). It also lists the three delinquent student loans (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c ($3,157), 1.d ($1,759), \nand 1.e ($5,373)). He disputed SOR \u00b6 1.a, and established that SOR \u00b6 1.b was paid. He \nprovided corroboration that he paid $5,000 and $3,000, in January and February 2010, \nrespectively, to address his student loan account. Applicant paid 11 debts. Four debts \n(student loans and child support) are in an established payment plan, and he disputed \nthree debts.   \n \nFailure to disclose delinquent debts on his security clearance application \n \nOn July 24, 2007, Applicant completed his security clearance application and \nindicated he did not have any unpaid judgments in the last seven years (SOR \u00b6 2.a; GE \n1). However, he disclosed he did have a debt currently over 90 days delinquent, and a \n\n \n5 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \ndebt delinquent over 180 days in the last seven years (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.b and 2.c; GE 1). He \nlisted his child support obligation in the comments section of his security clearance \napplication (SOR \u00b6 1.r; GE 1).  \n \nApplicant explained that he did not list several delinquent debts and two unpaid \njudgments when he completed his security clearance application because the creditors \ndid not notify him about the debts (Tr. 51-52). From January 2000 to September 2005, \nApplicant moved eight times (AE R at 1-2). From September 2005 to January 2007, \nApplicant was deployed to Iraq (Tr. 56; GE 1; AE R at 2). From August 2007 to \nNovember 2007, Applicant was deployed to Egypt (AE R at 2). From November 2007 to \npresent, Applicant was deployed to Afghanistan (AE R at 2).  \n \nApplicant did not receive notice of the two judgments in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.h and 1.q (Tr. \n51-52). In 2004, Applicant was late on his rent, and broke his lease, and the two \njudgments were served on the apartment he had vacated (Tr. 57-58; GE 7).  \n \nOn January 11, 2008, Applicant ran his credit report because he was purchasing \na vehicle and learned about his delinquent debts and the two judgments (Tr. 49-56, 66; \nGE 2 at 7). On January 31, 2008, an Office of Personnel Management (OPM) \ninvestigator interviewed Applicant, and Applicant discussed his credit report and \ndelinquent debt (Tr. 49-56, 66). He believes he brought the credit report to his OPM \ninterview (Tr. 66).  \n  \nWhole person evidence \n \nThe vice president of Applicant\u2019s company described Applicant\u2019s performance in \na combat zone as excellent (AE B). He is a lead supervisor on a highly demanding \nprogram in Afghanistan (AE B). He is diligent, has integrity, and is very responsible (AE \nB).  \n \nApplicant\u2019s general operations manager described Applicant\u2019s performance as \nspectacular (AE C). He has very strong attributes of integrity and honesty (AE C). He is \na highly valued employee with superb judgment, and dedication (AE C). \n \nApplicant has served in Iraq and Afghanistan as a contractor for more than four \nyears (AE R at 3). He often served in the field with troops and was exposed to enemy \nimprovised explosive devices (IED) and mines (AE R at 3). He provided force protection \nand support to troops in a combat zone (AE R at 3). He risked injury or death on behalf \nof the United States (AE R at 3).  \n  \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the \nExecutive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security \nemphasizing, \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. \nEgan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the \nauthority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine \n\n \n6 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \nwhether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. \nat 527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.    \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not \ninflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  \n \nThe government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. Clearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. \nOr. 10865 \u00a7 7. See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), \u00a7 3.1. Thus, nothing in \nthis Decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole or \nin part, on any express or implied determination as to applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or \npatriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the \nPresident and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance. \n \nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).      \n \nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of \ndisproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the government. See ISCR Case No. \n02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, \nif they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).   \n \n\n \n7 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \nAnalysis \n \n  \nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all \nappropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, I conclude the relevant security \nconcerns are under Guidelines F (financial considerations) and E (personal conduct).  \n \nFinancial Considerations \n \n  \nAG \u00b6 18 articulates the security concern relating to financial problems: \n \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds. \n  \nAG \u00b6 19 provides two Financial Considerations Disqualifying Conditions that \ncould raise a security concern and may be disqualifying in this case: \u201c(a) inability or \nunwillingness to satisfy debts;\u201d and \u201c(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d In \nISCR Case No. 08-12184 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan. 7, 2010), the Appeal Board explained: \n \nIt is well-settled that adverse information from a credit report can normally \nmeet the substantial evidence standard and the government\u2019s obligations \nunder [Directive] \u00b6 E3.1.14 for pertinent allegations. At that point, the \nburden shifts to applicant to establish either that [he or] she is not \nresponsible for the debt or that matters in mitigation apply. \n \n(internal citation omitted). Applicant\u2019s history of delinquent debt is documented in his \ncredit reports, his SOR response, and his statement at his hearing.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s SOR lists 18 debts totaling $29,075. His landlord obtained two \njudgments against Applicant in 2004. Three student loans and his child support became \ndelinquent several years ago. The government established the disqualifying conditions \nin AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c), requiring additional inquiry about the possible applicability of \nmitigating conditions.   \n \n  \nFive Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n\n \n8 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                           \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control; \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \nApplicant\u2019s conduct does not warrant full application of AG \u00b6 20(a). His \ndelinquent debts are \u201ca continuing course of conduct\u201d under the Appeal Board\u2019s \njurisprudence. See ISCR Case No. 07-11814 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 29, 2008) (citing ISCR \nCase No. 01-03695 (App. Bd. Oct. 16, 2002)). He did not pay some of his delinquent \ndebts until recently, and his student loans were not brought to current status until \nFebruary 2010. \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b) applies. Applicant\u2019s financial situation was damaged by brief periods \nof unemployment and underemployment before he obtained his current employment. \nHe has established that he acted responsibly under the circumstances. He has been \nemployed for the last four years overseas with a government contractor. Three student \nloans and his child support are in established payment plans. Three debts are disputed. \nEleven debts are paid. When Applicant became aware of his delinquent debts, he hired \na law firm to take care of them because he was deployed. He has gradually resolved his \ndelinquent debts. He maintained contact with his creditors as indicated by the numerous \nletters he sent to the creditors.2 \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c) partially applies. Although Applicant did not receive financial \ncounseling, he has otherwise learned about financial issues. Applicant cannot receive \nfull credit under AG \u00b6 20(c) because he has not received financial counseling. He does \nreceive some credit because there are some initial, positive \u201cindications that the \nproblem is being resolved or is under control.\u201d He has admitted his responsibility for his \n \n2\u201cEven if Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances \noutside his [or her] control, the Judge could still consider whether Applicant has since acted in a \nreasonable manner when dealing with those financial difficulties.\u201d ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. \nBd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 \nat 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). A component is \nwhether he or she maintained contact with creditors and attempted to negotiate partial payments to keep \ndebts current. \n\n \n9 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                           \ndebts, and he has resolved them.3 He also established some mitigation under AG \u00b6 \n20(d) because he showed some good faith4 in the resolution of his debts by settling and \npaying 11 debts. Three student loans and his child support are in established payment \nplans. AG \u00b6 20(e) applies to the three disputed debts. He wrote numerous letters to the \ncreditors and credit reporting companies to verify and then dispute debts. Two of the \nthree disputed debts were removed from his credit reports. He is unable to locate the \nthird creditor, a medical debt for $65. I am confident that if there was a basis for the \nthree disputed debts, Applicant would have paid them.  \n \nIn sum, Applicant started paying his delinquent debts as soon as he could verify \nthem. He paid 11 debts, and established payment plans on four debts. He promised to \npay his debts and show financial responsibility.5 He has met his burden of mitigating his \ndelinquent debts.   \n \nPersonal Conduct \n \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern pertaining to personal conduct: \n \n3 The Appeal Board has indicated that promises to pay off delinquent debts in the future are not a \nsubstitute for a track record of paying debts in a timely manner and otherwise acting in a financially \nresponsible manner. ISCR Case No. 07-13041 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 19, 2008) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-\n0012 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999)). \n \n4The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a \u201cgood faith\u201d effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts: \n \nIn order to qualify for application of [the \u201cgood faith\u201d mitigating condition], an applicant \nmust present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \nsome other good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant\u2019s debts. The Directive does \nnot define the term \u2018good-faith.\u2019 However, the Board has indicated that the concept of \ngood-faith \u2018requires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, \nprudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.\u2019 Accordingly, an applicant must \ndo more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally available option (such as \nbankruptcy) in order to claim the benefit of [the \u201cgood faith\u201d mitigating condition].  \n \n(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2004) (quoting \nISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 4, 2001)). \n \n5Of course, the government can re-validate Applicant\u2019s financial status at any time through credit \nreports, investigation and/or additional interrogatories. Approval of a clearance now does not bar the \ngovernment from subsequently revoking it, if warranted. A security clearance hearing premised on \ndelinquent debts highlights to Applicant the security concerns raised by delinquent debts. Violation of a \npromise made in a security context to pay legitimate debts and maintain financial responsibility also \nraises judgment concerns under Guideline E, and may support future revocation of a security clearance. \nAn administrative judge does not have authority to grant a conditional clearance or to order additional \ninvestigation. ISCR Case No. 08-07540 at 2 (App. Bd. Jan. 8, 2010); ISCR Case No. 04-03907 at 2 (App. \nBd. Sep. 18, 2006) (stating, \u201cThe Board has no authority to grant [a]pplicant a conditional or probationary \nsecurity clearance to allow [him or] her the opportunity to have a security clearance while [he or she] \nworks on [his or] her financial problems.\u201d and citing ISCR Case No. 03-07418 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 13, \n2004)). Applicant\u2019s clearance is not conditional and this footnote does not imply that this Applicant\u2019s \nclearance is conditional. \n \n\n \n10 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                           \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \nAG \u00b6 16 describes two conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying with respect to the alleged falsifications of documents used to process the \nadjudication of Applicant\u2019s security clearance in this case: \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; and \n \n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information concerning \nrelevant facts to an employer, investigator, security official, competent \nmedical authority, or other official government representative.6 \n \nOn July 24, 2007, Applicant completed his security clearance application. He \nindicated he did not have any unpaid judgments in the last seven years. However, he \ndisclosed he did have a debt currently over 90 days delinquent, and a debt delinquent \nover 180 days in the last seven years. He listed his child support obligation in the \ncomments section of his security clearance application. \n \nIn 2004, Applicant had two judgments against him which were not paid. He also \nhad 11 debts over 90 days delinquent listed on his August 30, 2007, credit report. AG \n\u00b6\u00b6 16(a) and 16(b) apply. \n \nAG \u00b6 17 provides seven conditions that could mitigate security concerns in this \ncase: \n \n \n6The Appeal Board has cogently explained the process for analyzing falsification cases, stating:\n \n(a) when a falsification allegation is controverted, Department Counsel has the burden of \nproving falsification; (b) proof of an omission, standing alone, does not establish or prove \nan applicant\u2019s intent or state of mind when the omission occurred; and (c) a Judge must \nconsider the record evidence as a whole to determine whether there is direct or \ncircumstantial evidence concerning the applicant\u2019s intent or state of mind at the time the \nomission occurred. [Moreover], it was legally permissible for the Judge to conclude \nDepartment Counsel had established a prima facie case under Guideline E and the \nburden of persuasion had shifted to the applicant to present evidence to explain the \nomission.  \n \nISCR Case No. 03-10380 at 5 (App. Bd. Jan. 6, 2006) (citing ISCR Case No. 02-23133 (App. Bd. June 9, \n2004)). \n\n \n11 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was \ncaused or significantly contributed to by improper or inadequate advice of \nauthorized personnel or legal counsel advising or instructing the individual \nspecifically concerning the security clearance process. Upon being made \naware of the requirement to cooperate or provide the information, the \nindividual cooperated fully and truthfully; \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, \nor other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur; \n \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress;  \n \n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable \nreliability; and \n \n(g) association with persons involved in criminal activity has ceased or \noccurs under circumstances that do not cast doubt upon the individual's \nreliability, trustworthiness, judgment, or willingness to comply with rules \nand regulations. \n  \nAG \u00b6 17(f) applies. Applicant disclosed his delinquent child support debt on his \nsecurity clearance application. He was not aware of the two judgments. The two \njudgments were served on an address he had already vacated. From 2000 to his \ndeployment to Iraq in 2005, Applicant changed addresses eight times, and letters from \ncreditors were not forwarded to him. He did not disclose his other delinquent debts \nbecause he was not aware of them. The allegation that he deliberately and intentionally \nfailed to disclose his delinquent debts and two judgments to the Department of Defense \nis not substantiated.    \n \nWhole Person Concept \n Under the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n\n \n12 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \nThe ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance \nmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nguidelines and the whole person concept. AG \u00b6 2(c). I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guidelines F and E in my whole person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(a) \nwere addressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional comment. \n \n  \nThe whole person factors against reinstatement of Applicant\u2019s clearance are \nsignificant; however, they do not warrant revocation of his security clearance. \nApplicant\u2019s failure to pay or resolve his just debts in accordance with contracts he \nsigned was not prudent or responsible. He has a history of financial problems. His credit \nreports listed 18 delinquent debts including two judgments.  \n      \nThe rationale for granting or reinstating Applicant\u2019s clearance is more substantial. \nHe was forthright and candid during the investigative and adjudicative process, \nincluding completion of his security clearance application, his responses to DOHA \ninterrogatories, his responses to an OPM investigator, and at his hearing about his \nfinancial problems. Several problems beyond his control adversely affected his financial \nstatus including unemployment and underemployment. He paid 11 debts. Three of the \nSOR debts related to student loans and one SOR debt related to his child support, \nwhich are now in current payment plans. Three debts are disputed. I am confident he \nwill keep his promise to pay his delinquent debts and maintain his financial \nresponsibility. The Appeal Board has addressed a key element in the whole person \nanalysis in financial cases stating: \n \nIn evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the \nconcept of \u201c\u2018meaningful track record\u2019 necessarily includes evidence of \nactual debt reduction through payment of debts.\u201d However, an applicant is \nnot required, as a matter of law, to establish that he has paid off each and \nevery debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an applicant \ndemonstrate that he has \u2018 . . . established a plan to resolve his financial \nproblems and taken significant actions to implement that plan.\u2019 The Judge \ncan reasonably consider the entirety of an applicant\u2019s financial situation \nand his actions in evaluating the extent to which that applicant\u2019s plan for \nthe reduction of his outstanding indebtedness is credible and realistic. See \nDirective \u00b6 E2.2(a) (\u2018Available, reliable information about the person, past \nand present, favorable and unfavorable, should be considered in reaching \na determination.\u2019) There is no requirement that a plan provide for \npayments on all outstanding debts simultaneously. Rather, a reasonable \n\n \n13 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \nplan (and concomitant conduct) may provide for the payment of such \ndebts one at a time. Likewise, there is no requirement that the first debts \nactually paid in furtherance of a reasonable debt plan be the ones listed in \nthe SOR. \n \nISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008) (internal citations omitted).  \n \nApplicant is 36 years old. He has achieved some important educational and \nemployment goals, demonstrating his self-discipline, responsibility and dedication. His \nfinancial problems were caused by unemployment or underemployment, rather than by \nmisconduct or irresponsible spending. Applicant is an intelligent person, and he \nunderstands how to budget and what he needs to do to establish and maintain a stable \nfinancial situation. Clearly, he could have acted more aggressively to resolve his debts \nafter receiving employment with a government contractor in September 2007. There is, \nhowever, simply no reason not to trust him. Moreover, he has established a \u201cmeaningful \ntrack record\u201d of debt re-payment.  \n \nApplicant has demonstrated his loyalty, patriotism and trustworthiness through \nhis service to the Department of Defense as a contractor and when he was on active \nduty in the Army. He has served more than four years in combat zones in Iraq and \nAfghanistan as a contractor. He has risked his own life to support Department of \nDefense missions in those countries. Character witnesses described Applicant as highly \nprofessional and diligent. Their evaluations document his solid work performance and \ngood character. He is an important asset to his corporation. His security clearance \napplication does not list any other reportable incidents involving illegal drugs, alcohol, \nthe police, or courts.    \n \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, and all the facts and \ncircumstances, in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has mitigated \nthe financial considerations and personal conduct security concerns. I take this position \nbased on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988), my \ncareful consideration of the whole person factors and supporting evidence, my \napplication of the pertinent factors under the Adjudicative Process, and my \ninterpretation of my responsibilities under the Guidelines. Applicant has mitigated or \novercome the government\u2019s case. For the reasons stated, I conclude he is eligible for \naccess to classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:   \n \n FOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a to 1.r: \n For Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:    \n FOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a to 2.c: \n For Applicant \n\n \n14 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance. Eligibility for a security clearance is granted. \n \n \n \n____________________________ \nMARK HARVEY \nAdministrative Judge \n",

His eligibility for a security clearance is granted. \n \nApplicant signed his Questionnaire for Sensitive Positions (SF-86) on September \n10, 2008. On May 27, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) \nissued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations. The action was taken under Executive Order \n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and \nthe revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, \n2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September \n1, 2006.  \n  \n \nOn June 17, 2009, Applicant answered the SOR in writing. He elected to have a \nhearing before an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on August 3, \nSeptember 11, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n \n2009. A Notice of Hearing, setting Applicant\u2019s hearing for August 26, 2009, was issued \nAugust 6, 2009. I convened the hearing as scheduled to consider whether it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for \nApplicant. \n \nThe Government called no witnesses and introduced five exhibits, which were \nmarked Ex. 1 through 5 and admitted to the record without objection. Applicant testified \non his own behalf and called no witnesses. He introduced three exhibits, which were \nidentified and marked as Ex. A through Ex. C and admitted to the record without \nobjection.   \n \nAt the conclusion of the hearing, I left the record open until close of business on \nSeptember 2, 2009, so that Applicant could, if he wished, provide additional information \nfor the record. Applicant timely filed six additional exhibits. Department Counsel did not \nobject to Applicant\u2019s post-hearing submissions. I marked the post-hearing submissions \nas his Ex. D through Ex. I, and they were admitted to the record. DOHA received the \ntranscript (Tr.) of the hearing on September 2, 2009. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nThe SOR contains nine allegations of disqualifying conduct under AG F, \nFinancial Considerations. Applicant admitted all nine allegations and offered additional \ninformation. Applicant\u2019s admissions are admitted as findings of fact. (SOR; Answer to \nSOR.)  \n \n \nApplicant is 28 years old, an information technology (IT) specialist, and employed \nas a Blackberry administrator by a government contractor. He is single and has \ncompleted three years of college. He needs 20 additional college credits in order to \nobtain a bachelor\u2019s degree. He seeks a security clearance. (Ex. 1; Tr. 16, 31, 64-65.)  \n \n \nApplicant owes approximately $34,000 in education loans. He owes the federal \ndirect student loan program approximately $27,034, including interest, fees, and costs. \nThese debts are alleged at SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b. through 1.g. Additionally, Applicant owes his \nstate student loan program approximately $6,425. His state student loan debts are \nalleged at SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a., 1.h., and 1.i. The SOR alleges no other outstanding delinquent \ndebts. (SOR; Ex. A; Ex. B; Ex. D; Tr. 41, 57.) \n \n \nApplicant began his college education in 1999. For his first two years of study, \nhis parents paid his student loans. Then, as his younger sisters began to attend college, \nhis parents found it necessary to assist them. Beginning in 2001, Applicant took on \nresponsibility for paying his education loans.  (Tr. 27-28, 35-36.) \n \n \nFrom May 2000 until October 2006, while he was enrolled in his university \nstudies, Applicant participated in a federal Stay in School Program. He understood that \nthe federal agency that employed him would pay his student loans if he maintained a \n\u201cC\u201d average. In 2006, the agency notified the Stay in School Program students that it \n\n \n3 \n \n \n                                           \nwould undergo downsizing. Applicant and other students in the program were \ncounseled and advised that they would be laid off. Applicant decided he would not wait \nto be laid off.   (Ex. 1; Tr. 34-35, 41.) \n \n \nIn November 2006, he took a job with a communications company as a customer \naccount executive. His annual salary was $28,000.  He was having difficulty paying his \neducation debts. His parents helped him by paying $2,000 on his state student loans. \n(Tr. 28.) \n \n \n In February 2007, he took a job with another communications company. He was \nno longer in school, and his federal student loans were in default. He could not afford to \nrepay the federal student loans. His salary was $34,000 a year, and in April 2008, he \nreceived a raise to $38,000 a year. He began to work for his present employer in \nSeptember 2008, at an annual salary of $50,000. (Tr. 38, 41-42.) \n \n \nSoon after beginning his present job, Applicant felt he was financially able to \nbegin paying his student loan debts. He contacted the federal student loan program to \narrange payment of his federal student loans. Because his loans were in default, he \nentered a program to rehabilitate them. Beginning in November 2008, he paid $299 a \nmonth to rehabilitate his loans and remove them from default status. In July 2009, the \nfederal direct student loan program informed him that his regular payments had \nrehabilitated his delinquent loans. He continues to make monthly payments to repay his \nfederal direct student loans. In August 2009, the federal direct student loan program \nnotified him that it had requested that the national credit bureaus remove negative credit \ninformation about the loans from his credit reports. (Ex. C; Ex. E; Tr. 36-42, 49.) \n \n \nIn June 2009, Applicant entered into a payment plan with his state student loan \nprogram to repay his delinquent state student loans. He agreed to pay the state agency \n$270 a month until he was able to pay more. (Ex.B; Tr. 46-51.) \n \n \nAfter his hearing, Applicant consulted with the state student loan agency and with \na credit counseling firm about his state student loan delinquencies. The state student \nloan agency agreed to cancel the payment plan he had agreed to so that he could work \nwith the credit counseling firm to consolidate his state student loan debt with his credit \ncard debt of approximately $700 and pay both off at the same time.1 He did this \nbecause he thought it would have a beneficial effect on his credit rating. (Ex. D; Ex. G; \nEx. H.) \n \n    \nApplicant\u2019s net take home pay each month is $3,200. In order to save money and \npay his debts, he lives at home in his parents\u2019 basement, and he pays them $400 a \nmonth in rent. His food expenses are $250. He pays his family\u2019s cable bill of $100 every \nmonth. He has a monthly car payment of $469. He spends $108 each month on car \ninsurance and approximately $150 on gasoline. His monthly cell phone bill is $84. \nAdditionally, he pays $299 to the federal direct student loan program, and he will pay \n \n1 Applicant testified that he was not in arrears on his credit card debt. (Ex. D; Tr. 58, 79.) \n\n \n4 \n \n \n$270 or an equivalent amount to satisfy his delinquent state student loans. Periodically, \nhe is repaying the $2,000 loan his parents made on his behalf when they paid his state \nstudent loan delinquency in 2006. To date, he has repaid $700 of the $2,000 to his \nparents. (Tr. 40-45. 53-55, 63-64.) \n \n \nApplicant submitted a performance assessment from the company that employed \nhim in 2007. The employer rated Applicant as a \u201cHigh Contributor\u201d and praised \nApplicant\u2019s strong work ethic, his leadership, and his interpersonal skills. His current \nemployer praised his \u201cexceptional customer service experience,\u201d his ability to work \nproductively off-site without supervision, and his strong interpersonal skills. (Ex. F; Ex. \nI.)   \n  \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the \nExecutive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security, and \nit has emphasized that \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the \nNavy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the \nauthority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine \nwhether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information. Id. at \n527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.   \n  \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, an  \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, the administrative judge applies these guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG & 18:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under \nAG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.  \nSimilarly under AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise \nsecurity concerns. Applicant accumulated substantial delinquent student loan debt and \nwas unable or unwilling to pay his creditors. This evidence is sufficient to raise these \npotentially disqualifying conditions. \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Several Guideline F mitigating conditions \ncould apply to the security concerns raised by Applicant\u2019s financial delinquencies. \n\n \n6 \n \n \nUnresolved financial delinquency might be mitigated if it \u201chappened so long ago, was so \ninfrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does \nnot cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d \n(AG \u00b6 20(a)) Additionally, unresolved financial delinquency might be mitigated if \u201cthe \nconditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s \ncontrol, (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical \nemergency, or a death, divorce, or separation), and the individual acted responsibly \nunder the circumstances.\u201d (AG \u00b6 20(b)) Still other mitigating circumstances that might \nbe applicable include evidence that \u201cthe person has received or is receiving counseling \nfor the problem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or \nis under control\u201d (AG \u00b6 20(c)) or \u201cthe individual has initiated a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.\u201d (AG \u00b6 20(d))  Finally, if \u201cthe individual has \na reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-due debt which is the cause of \nthe problem and provides documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or \nprovides evidence of options to resolve the issue,\u201d then AG \u00b6 20(e) might apply.  \n \nApplicant admitted a history of financial difficulties related to his education loans, \nwhich are substantial. From 2000 to 2006, Applicant was enrolled in the federal Stay in \nSchool Program, and he expected the program to assist him with the payment of his \nstudent loans. In 2006, the federal agency where he worked cut back on funding for the \nStay in School Program. Applicant left the agency and sought private sector \nemployment. Between 2006 and the end of 2008, his low income prevented him from \npaying his delinquent federal and state student loans. When he obtained a job which \npaid him a better wage, he set out to satisfy his student loan delinquencies. Beginning \nin October 2008, he rehabilitated his federal direct student loans, and he has entered a \npayment plan to satisfy this debt of approximately $27,000. Additionally, he has sought \ncredit counseling and is working with a credit management firm to consolidate payment \nof his state student loan delinquencies and his credit card debt. His current annual \nincome is sufficient for him to make these payments, so long as he continues to live \nfrugally. \n \n Applicant is 28 years old, and he has learned, through experience, some hard \nfinancial lessons. He has acknowledged his financial responsibilities and has made \ngood-faith efforts to satisfy his creditors. He sought financial counseling, and it is clear \nthat he is learning to resolve his current financial problems and to avoid repeating the \nsame mistakes in the future. I conclude that AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), 20(b), 20(c), and 20(d) apply \nin mitigation to the facts of Applicant\u2019s case. AG \u00b6 20(e) is not relevant in this case. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is a young person of 28 \nyears. His supervisors and co-workers respect him and rely upon his expertise and \ntechnical knowledge. His financial problems began when he accumulated student loan \ndelinquencies and lacked sufficient resources to repay the loans. When he acquired a \njob that paid him enough income to meet his financial obligations, he set up plans to pay \nhis student loan debts. At the present time, there appear to be no impediments to \nprevent him from timely repaying his student loans and meeting his other financial \nobligations. \n \nApplicant has shown good faith in contacting his creditors and arranging payment \nplans to satisfy his student loan creditors. He is currently living within his means and \npaying attention to his financial obligations. \n \nI observed Applicant carefully at his security clearance hearing.  I found him to be \na serious and responsible person. I believe it is highly unlikely that in the future he will \nfail to carry out any of the responsibilities of a person entrusted with a security \nclearance and the protection of classified information. I conclude that he is not a \nsecurity risk at this time. \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with no questions or doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s judgment and eligibility and suitability for a security clearance, and I \nconclude Applicant mitigated the security concerns arising under Guideline F, Financial \nConsiderations. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n                    FOR  APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a. through 1.i.:          For Applicant \n\n \n8 \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it  is  \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n______________________ \nJoan Caton Anthony \nAdministrative Judge \n",
