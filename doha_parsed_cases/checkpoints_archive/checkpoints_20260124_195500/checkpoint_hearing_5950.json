    "summary": "Findings of Fact In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admits to all of the allegations. Applicant is a 56-year-old employee with a Department of Defense contractor seeking a security clearance. He has worked for his current employer for the past six years. From 1970 to 1990, he served on active duty in the United States Air Force. He retired at the rank of Staff Sergeant (E-5). He held a security clearance for 19 years while on active duty in the Air Force. He has a high school education. He is married and has two adult sons. (Tr at 6-8, 32-34, 55-56; Gov 1; AE F at 2, 8.) On April 11, 2006, Applicant filed an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-QIP).

Nagel, Esquire, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro Se \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nHOGAN, Erin C., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant submitted his Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing \n(e-QIP), on April 11, 2006. On October 22, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns \nunder Guideline F, Financial Considerations, and Guideline E, Personal Conduct, for \nApplicant. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense \nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) \npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the \nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nOn November 18, 2007, Applicant answered the SOR and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge. Department Counsel was ready to be proceed on \nJanuary 25, 2008. The case was assigned to another administrative judge on January \n28, 2008. The case was transferred to me on February 26, 2008. On March 13, 2008, a \nNotice of Hearing was issued scheduling the hearing for April 14, 2008. The hearing \nwas held, as scheduled. The Government offered five exhibits which were admitted as \nGovernment Exhibits (Gov) 1-5 without objection. The Applicant offered five exhibits \nMay 20, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \n \nwhich were admitted as Applicant Exhibits (AE) A - E without objection. Applicant \ntestified. The record was held open until April 28, 2008, to allow Applicant to submit \nadditional evidence. Applicant timely submitted a nine-page document that was \nadmitted as AE F without objection. The transcript was received on April 22, 2008. The \nrecord closed on April 28, 2008. Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, \nexhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admits to all of the allegations.  \n \nApplicant is a 56-year-old employee with a Department of Defense contractor \nseeking a security clearance.  He has worked for his current employer for the past six \nyears. From 1970 to 1990, he served on active duty in the United States Air Force. He \nretired at the rank of Staff Sergeant (E-5). He held a security clearance for 19 years \nwhile on active duty in the Air Force.  He has a high school education. He is married \nand has two adult sons. (Tr at 6-8, 32-34, 55-56; Gov 1; AE F at 2, 8.)   \n \nOn April 11, 2006, Applicant filed an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations \nProcessing (e-QIP). He answered, \u201cNo\u201d in response to questions 28(a) \u201cIn the last 7 \nyears, have you been over 180 days delinquent on any debt(s)?\u201d and 28(b) \u201cAre you \ncurrently over 90 days delinquent on any debt(s)?\u201d (Gov 1.)  \n \nA subsequent background investigation revealed that Applicant had the following  \ndelinquent accounts:  a $9,891 debt resulting from an automobile repossession (SOR \u00b6 \n1.a; Gov 2 at 2; Gov 3 at 3; Gov 5 at 5; Gov 6 at 2); a $1,837 charged off credit card \naccount (SOR \u00b6 1.b; Gov 2 at 2; Gov 3 at 4; Gov 5 at 4); a $1,392 delinquent credit card \naccount (SOR \u00b6 1.c; Gov 2 at 2; Gov 3 at 4); a $648 charged off credit card account  \n(SOR \u00b6 1.d; Gov 2 at 2; Gov 3 at 4; Gov 5 at 4); and a $6,047 charged off military \nexchange credit card account (SOR \u00b6 1.e; Gov 2 at 2-3; Gov 4 at 8; Gov 5 at 6). \n \nApplicant states that he did not intend to falsify his e-QIP application. He did not \nrealize that he had debts that were that old. He did not obtain a credit report before he \ncompleted his e-QIP application. He is an honest man and would never betray his \ncountry. (Tr at 53-54.) \n \nApplicant claims most of the delinquent accounts were the result of bad financial \nmanagement. He and his wife do not follow a budget very well. They attended financial \ncounseling a few years after he retired from the military. (Tr at 36, 58-59.) He describes \nhis current financial situation as \u201cIt\u2019s not great, ma\u2019am. It could be better, but we\u2019re \nworking hard on it. We\u2019re trying to catch up on stuff.\u201d He has not opened any new \naccounts and occasionally gets behind a payment or two. (Tr at 51; 60.)  \n \nAt hearing, Applicant pointed out that he had a state tax lien which he paid off in \nOctober 2007. (Tr at 56-67.) A recent credit report, dated April 8, 2008, listed a state tax \n\n \n3 \n \n \nlien for $2,041. (Gov 6.) After the hearing, Applicant provided documentation verifying \nthe debt was paid off. (AE F at 3.) \n \nThe current status of the debts alleged in the SOR are: \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.a: $9,891 balance owed after automobile repossession in December \n2005. Applicant admits he never made payments towards this debt. He was four \npayments late when the truck was repossessed. After the automobile was resold, the \ncreditor sent him a letter indicating that he still owed the creditor $9,000 on the loan. \nApplicant recently contacted the creditor and the creditor said that he does not owe \nanything. (Tr at 35-38.) He provided a letter from the creditor, dated March 10, 2008, \nthat states Applicant was a member in good standing during the time he had an account \nwith the creditor from July 27, 2004, to April 19, 2007. (AE D.) The debt is still listed on \nhis most recent credit report, dated April 8, 2008. (Gov 6 at 3.)  \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.b: $1,837 charged off credit card account. Applicant recently entered \ninto a repayment plan with the creditor. He agreed to pay $200 a month to resolve this \ndebt. He made his first payment on April 8, 2008. (Tr at 27, 40; AE B; AE F at 4.)  \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.c: $1,392 charged off credit card account. Applicant testified that he \nsettled this account. A credit report, dated April 8, 2008, indicated that a credit card \naccount was settled. Upon further review, it appears the account that was settled is the \ndebt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.d based on the account numbers provided in the credit report. \nApplicant has three different credit card accounts with the same company. (Tr at 41-42; \nGov 6 at 2.) He testified that the credit card company said one of the accounts is closed. \nHe is willing to pay it if he owes it. (Tr at 43.)  This account is not listed on his most \nrecent credit report, dated April 8, 2008. (Gov 6.)  \n \n SOR \u00b6 1.d:  $648 charged off credit card account.  Applicant settled this account \nand it is paid in full.  There was some confusion over the account number and he \nthought he settled the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.c. The account number indicates that \nthis is the credit card account that was settled. (Tr at 42-43; AE C; Gov 6 at 2.)  \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.e: $6,047 charged off military exchange credit card account. Applicant \nthought payments were being taken out of his military retirement account towards this \ndebt. They were not. An allotment of $210 per month is currently taken out of his military \nretirement check towards this debt. The allotment started on November 1, 2007. (Tr at \n44-47; AE E; Answer to SOR.)   \n \nApplicant\u2019s take home pay is approximately $2,800 per month after taxes. His \nwife\u2019s take home pay is approximately $2,800 per month.  Their mortgage is $1,300 per \nmonth. They have a $230 car payment. Groceries and expenses are approximately \n$500 to $600 per month. (Tr at 48.) Based on the information Applicant provided at the \nhearing, their total monthly expenses would be $2,030.  After expenses, approximately \n$3,570 in discretionary income is left over. Applicant is current on all federal and state \nincome taxes. (Tr at 56.)  \n\n \n4 \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s project manager states that he is a steady and reliable employee. He \nperforms his daily tasks efficiently and effectively and handles his collateral duties in a \nprofessional manner. (AE A.) His assistant project manager has worked with Applicant \nfor the past seven years and says that he is an asset to the organization. He states that \nApplicant conducts himself in a professional, highly organized manner. He is relied upon \nto train and coordinate other duties within the organization. (AE F at 7.) A personal \nfriend of Applicant states that he treats everyone with respect. He does not gossip or \ncheat. He is the first one to offer a helping hand. She describes Applicant as a \u201chard \nworker, good husband, an exceptional parent and very good friend.\u201d Her grandchildren \nlook up to him and refer to him as \u201cUncle.\u201d (AE F at 9.)   \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \n\n \n5 \n \n \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG & 18:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several disqualifying conditions that could raise security \nconcerns. I find Financial Considerations Disqualifying Condition (FC DC) &19(a) (an \ninability or unwillingness to satisfy debts); and FC DC &19(c), (a history of not meeting \nfinancial obligations) apply to Applicant\u2019s case. Applicant has a history of not meeting \nfinancial obligations. He incurred five unresolved delinquent accounts with a total \napproximate balance of $19,815.   \n  \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Financial Considerations Mitigating Condition \n(FC MC) \u00b6 20(a) (the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment) is not applicable. \nAlthough Applicant is taking steps to resolve his accounts, only one account was \nresolved at the close of the record. He entered into payment plans for two of the \naccounts. He recently entered into a payment plan for the debt alleged in SOR \u00b61.b. It is \ntoo soon to apply FC MC \u00b6 20(a) based on Applicant\u2019s past history of financial \nirresponsibility as well as his admission that he and his wife still occasionally get a \npayment or two behind on some of their bills.    \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \n \nFC MC & 20(b) (the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual \nacted responsibly under the circumstances) does not apply. Applicant states most of his \nfinancial problems were the result of financial irresponsibility as opposed to conditions \nthat were beyond his control.  \n \nFC MC \u00b620(c) (the person has received or is receiving counseling for the \nproblem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under \ncontrol) does not apply. Shortly after he retired in 1990, Applicant and his wife attended \nfinancial counseling. They continued to have financial problems. Applicant is making \nprogress toward resolving his financial delinquencies but it is too soon to conclude that \nhis financial problems are under control. Financial counseling would be helpful for \nApplicant to establish a budget and learn strategies to avoid financial problems in the \nfuture.   \n \nFC MC &20(d) (the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue \ncreditors or otherwise resolve debts) applies. Applicant has contacted each of the \ncreditors alleged in the SOR.  He paid off the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.d. He is making \npayments towards the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.e.  He provided a letter from \nthe creditor alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a which states that his account is in good standing. (He \nadmits that he never made a payment towards the balance of the automobile loan after \nhis truck was repossessed and the debt remains listed on his most recent credit report, \ndated April 8, 2008.) The credit card company claims that he no longer owes the debt \nalleged in SOR \u00b6 1.c. This debt no longer appears on his credit report. (Gov 6.) \nApplicant has made progress towards resolving his accounts. If it is later determined \nthat he owes the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.c, he is willing to resolve the \naccounts. He submitted documentation indicating he does not owe these accounts at \nthis time.          \n \n \nPersonal Conduct \n \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in \nAG &15: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \n \nPersonal conduct concerns are raised because Applicant failed to list his \ndelinquent accounts in response to section 28(a) and 28(b) on his e-QIP application. \nPersonal Conduct Disqualifying Condition \u00b6 17(a) (deliberate omission, concealment, or \nfalsification of relevant facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history \n\n \n7 \n \n \nstatement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities) potentially applies to this allegation. \nApplicant claims that he did not realize that he had older delinquent debts. He did not \nhave a copy of a recent credit report and was not aware of the delinquent accounts.  He \ndid not intend to falsify his e-QIP application. I find Applicant\u2019s explanation credible. \nSome individuals have financial problems because they do not keep track of their \naccounts. I find for Applicant with respect to the personal conduct concern.   \n \n  \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness \nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation \nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent \nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I considered Applicant\u2019s military \ncareer and his favorable references from co-workers and friends. Although Applicant did \nnot resolve all of his delinquent accounts, he provided proof that he took steps to \nresolve each one of his delinquent accounts. He paid one account and is making \npayments towards two other accounts. Applicant made no payments on two accounts, \nhowever, both creditors informed Applicant that the accounts are closed. I give credit to \nApplicant for contacting these creditors in an attempt to resolve these accounts. It \nappears Applicant is capable of resolving his debts based on his current financial \nsituation and his most recent credit report. Applicant is warned that future financial \nproblems will raise future security concerns. He should take preventive steps to avoid \nfuture financial problems. Considering his favorable work performance and 20 years of \nhonorable military service, Applicant\u2019s current financial situation does not raise a \nsecurity concern. Applicant mitigated the security concerns arising under financial \nconsiderations, and personal conduct.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n8 \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.e:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.b:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

    "full_text": "KEYWORD: Alcohol; Personal Conduct\nDIGEST: Applicant is a 25-year-old junior business analyst for a defense contractor.  He admits he\nconsumed alcohol to the point of intoxication a few times a month for over ten years.  His alcohol\nconsumption led to two driving while intoxicated offenses, being terminated from a job, and being\narrested as a minor in possession of alcohol.

He admits he\nconsumed alcohol to the point of intoxication a few times a month for over ten years.  His alcohol\nconsumption led to two driving while intoxicated offenses, being terminated from a job, and being\narrested as a minor in possession of alcohol.  Applicant admits to using cocaine from 2002 to 2006,\nand using the illegal substances of mushrooms, marijuana, and ecstacy from 1999 to 2004.  His\nsubstance abuse led to treatment at a substance abuse medical treatment facility as well as after care.\nHe deliberately did not include his drug use on his security clearance application.  Clearance is\ndenied.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn December 18, 2006, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its decision to deny a security clearance for\nApplicant.  The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information\nwithin Industry (February 20, 1990), as amended, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6,\nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended\n(Directive), using the revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG), issued on December 29, 2005, and\nimplemented by the Department of Defense on September 1, 2006.  The revised guidelines were\nprovided to Applicant and he was aware that the case would be adjudicated under those guidelines.\nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on December 22, 2006.  The SOR alleges security\nconcerns under Guideline G (Alcohol Consumption), Guideline H (Drug Involvement), and\nGuideline E (Personal Conduct) of the Directive.\nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on January 5, 2007.  He admitted all of the\nallegations under the Guidelines with a detailed explanation.  He requested a hearing before an\nadministrative judge, and the request was received by DOHA on January 10, 2007.  Department\nCounsel was prepared to proceed with the case on January 24, 2007, and the case was assigned to\nme on January 29, 2007.  A notice of hearing was issued on February 9, 2007, and the hearing\nconvened on February 27, 2007.  Two government exhibits, marked Government exhibits 1 and 2\nwere received without objection.  Nine Applicant exhibits, marked Applicant Exhibits A through I,\nwere received without objection.  The testimony of the Applicant and one Applicant witness were\nreceived during the hearing.  DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on March 9, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nAfter a thorough review of the pleadings, transcript, and exhibits, I make the following\nessential findings of fact.\nApplicant is a 25-year-old college graduate and has been employed as a Junior Business\nAnalyst for a defense contractor since October 2005.  He completed a security clearance application\non December 27, 2005.  He has never held a security clearance.1\n\nTr. 44-46.\n2\nTr. 36-37; Government Exhibit 2 (Criminal Information Report, dated January 11, 2006).\n3\nTr. 37-38.\n4\nTr. 39-41.\n5\nTr. 43.\n6\nTr. 50.\n7\nTr. 51-52.\n8\n3\nApplicant admits that from 1996 to March 2006, he consumed alcohol at times to the point\nof intoxication.  He started drinking alcohol at the age of 15 in high school.  He first drank on week-\nends, then went to drinking day-to-day in college starting in 1999.  He drank alcohol to the point of\nintoxication two or three times a week while in college until graduation in 2003.  After college, he\ndrank alcohol three or four times a week to the point of intoxication until March 5, 2006.  Applicant\nadmitted he was terminated from a part time job as a bartender at a country club for excessive\nalcohol consumption when he come to work with the smell and affects of the previous evenings\nalcohol consumption.  When he drank to excess, he would blackout once or twice a month.2\nApplicant admitted he was arrested on September 20, 2001, for being a minor in possession\nof alcohol and having a fake identification card.  He was ordered to attend alcohol awareness classes.\nHe attended such class for three hours weekly for eight weeks.  He was not evaluated for alcohol\ndependence during these classes.3\nApplicant admitted he was arrested for driving while intoxicated and stopping in a roadway\non February 25, 2005.  After drinking about 10 to 15 alcoholic drinks, he fell asleep in his car at a\ntraffic light.  He refused to take a breathalyser test.  He was convicted of the offenses and his driver\u2019s\nlicense was suspended for 90 days.  He drove during the suspension, and he was sentenced to jail for\n60 days suspended, paid a fine of $600, and placed on probation for one year.4\nPrior to completion of his probation for the above offenses, Applicant admitted he was\narrested for driving under the influence on October 27, 2005, after he drove off a road and hit a\ntelephone pole.  His breathalyser test showed a blood alcohol level of .14.  He was sentenced to jail\nfor 180 days, suspended, fined $1,500, and placed on probation for two years.  When he went to\ncourt for this offense, his attorney appealed the February 2005 incident so both cases were processed\ntogether, and his sentence was for both offenses.   At the time of the hearing for his security\n5\nclearance, he was still serving the one year probation from this offense.  \n6\nApplicant admitted using cocaine once or twice a month from 2002 until March 2006.  He\nusually purchased the drug from individuals he knew as sellers.7\nApplicant admitted using mushrooms and ecstasy as a college student from 1999 to 2003.\nHe and his friends harvested the mushrooms from fields around their college.  He knew he was using\nan illegal drug, and used the drug five or six times.  He last used mushrooms in 2004.  He used\necstasy five or six times in college.  His last use of ecstacy was in 2003.8\n\nTr. 54-55: Applicant Exhibit B and C(Treatment Facility letters, dated, March 21, 2006); Applicant Exhibit\n9\nD (Treatment Plan, dated March 23, 2006; Applicant Exhibit E (Treatment completion certificate, dated April 2006).\nTr. 28-29.\n10\nApplicant Exhibit F (Continuing care plan, dated November 22, 2006).\n11\nApplicant Exhibit I (Letter, dated February 19, 2007).\n12\nTr. 29-33, 58-64.\n13\n4\nIn March 2005, one of Applicant\u2019s employers recommended he seek treatment for his alcohol\nabuse.  He attended a few meetings of Alcoholic Anonymous but was not serious about full\ntreatment.  In March 2006, he felt he had reached a low point in his life and needed to change.  He\nchecked himself into a substance abuse treatment facility.  He acknowledged to the counselors he\nneeded treatment and professional help.  He was an inpatient from March 5, 2006, until March 21,\n2006.  He was diagnosed by the treatment program\u2019s medical doctor and clinical social worker as\nalcohol and opiate dependent.  Applicant admitted he tested positive for marijuana during the\ntreatment and regularly used opiates before he was admitted to the program.   \n9\nApplicant completed his security clearance application on December 27, 2005.  In response\nto question 24 which asks since the age of 16 or in the last seven years, whichever is shorter, had he\nillegally used any controlled substance, Applicant answered \u201cNO\u201d.  Applicant used cocaine from\n1999 to 2006, and mushrooms and ecstasy from 1999 to 2004.  Applicant admitted he deliberately\nanswered this question falsely because he wanted to hide his drug use, and feared if he was truthful\nhe would not receive a security clearance and lose his job.   \n10\nSince March 2006, Applicant has a steady home environment living with his parents and\nbrother.  He stopped contact with his former friends that used drugs and alcohol with him.  His social\nbase is his family.  He still has two friends who drink alcohol, but they are aware of his situation.\nHe does not frequent places that serve alcohol.  His parents do not keep alcohol in the house.  From\nhis inpatient treatment and continued attendance at alcoholics anonymous meetings, he has learned\nwhy he drank alcohol and used drugs.  He knows what he needs to do to maintain sobriety.  He also\nunderstands it is a daily battle.  He is presently in an aftercare program under the supervision of a\ncounselor.   He is considered an excellent worker, well-liked by his supervisors and peers.  They\n11\nconsider that he has a bright future ahead of him.   He attends weekly alcohol anonymous meetings.\n12\nHe takes pride in his character and is maintaining his honesty.  He takes a proactive approach to his\ndaily substance awareness program which has a foundation in spirituality.  He presently does not\nhave a sponsor under alcoholic anonymous since his old sponsor left.  But he has people he can call\nfor assistance both at home, at work, and in social agencies.  He has no desire to go back to his old\nlife style.  He wants to live the life he has established for the last year.   \n13\nPOLICIES\n\nDepartment of the Navy v.

Each clearance decision must be fair, impartial, and a commonsense decision based on the\nrelevant and material facts and circumstances, the whole person concept, and the factors listed in the\nDirective \u00b6 6.3.1 through \u00b6 6.3.6.\nThe adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make\nan affirmative determination that the person is eligible for a security clearance.  An administrative\njudge must apply the \u201cwhole person concept,\u201d and consider and carefully weigh the available, reliable\ninformation about the person.   An administrative judge should consider: (1) the nature, extent, and\n16\nseriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the applicant\u2019s age and maturity at the\ntime of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation\nand other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for\npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation of recurrence.17\nA person granted access to classified information enters into a special relationship with the\ngovernment.  The government must be able to repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those\nindividuals to whom it grants access to classified information.  The decision to deny an individual a\nsecurity clearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant.   It is merely\n18\nan indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of\nDefense have established for issuing a clearance.\nInitially, the Government must present evidence to establish controverted facts in the SOR that\ndisqualify or may disqualify the Applicant from being eligible for access to classified information.19\nThereafter, Applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate\nfacts.   An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the\n20\n\nISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \n21\nISCR Case No. 99-0597 (App. Bd.

Any of these characteristics in a person could indicate that the person may not\nproperly safeguard classified information.  Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful and\ncandid answers during the security clearance process or any other failure to cooperate with the security\nclearance process.\nGuideline G - Excessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable\njudgment, failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability and\ntrustworthiness.\nGuideline H - Use of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise questions about\nan individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because it may impair judgment and because it\nraises questions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations.\nDrug abuse is the illegal use of a drug or use of a legal drug in a manner that deviates from approved\nmedical direction.\nConditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying, as well as those which\nwould mitigate security concerns, pertaining to the adjudicative guidelines are set forth and discussed\nin the conclusions section below.\nCONCLUSIONS\nI carefully considered all of the factors in evidence and the legal standards discussed above.\nI reach the following conclusions regarding the allegations in the SOR.\n\n7\nApplicant \u2019s deliberate false answer to a question on his security clearance application brings\nthe matter under Personal Conduct Disqualifying Condition (PC DC) \u00b6 26(a) (the deliberate omission,\nconcealment, or falsification of relevant and material facts from any personnel security questionnaire,\npersonal history statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment\nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness or\naward fiduciary responsibilities).  It is a security concern when an applicant does not include negative\npersonal information, such as incidents of alcohol or drug abuse, on a security clearance application.\nApplicant considered his drug abuse an embarrassment so he did not list it on his application raising\n(PC DC) \u00b6 16(e) (personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s conduct, that creates\na vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress, such as(1) engaging in activities which, if\nknown, may affect the person\u2019s personal, professional, or community standing).\nI considered all of the Personal Conduct Mitigating Conditions and determine none apply.\nApplicant does not deny his use of illegal drugs, and admits he deliberately did not list his use on the\nsecurity clearance application.  He knew when he answered \u201cNO\u201d to questions 24, he was not truthful.\nAny untruthfulness has a direct relationship to an applicant\u2019s judgment, truthfulness, or reliability.  His\naction in concealing his drug abuse was done a little over a year ago, and was deliberate with an intent\nto deceive.  I find against Applicant on the allegation under Guideline E.\nApplicant\u2019s abuse of alcohol and illegal drugs creates security concerns.  There is a security\nconcern because excess alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment, or\nthe failure to control impulses, and raises concern for the individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness.\nThere is a security concern for use of an illegal drug because it can raise questions about an\nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, and may impair judgment raising questions about the\nperson\u2019s ability and willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations.  An illegal drug is\nidentified and listed in the Controlled Substances Act of 1970, as amended.\nApplicant\u2019s history of alcohol consumption, his abuse of alcohol, and medical treatment for\nthe alcohol abuse raises Alcohol Consumption Disqualifying Condition (DC) \u00b6 22(a) (alcohol-related\nincidents away from work, such as driving while under the influence); DC \u00b6 22(b) (alcohol-related\nincidents at work, such as reporting for work or duty in an intoxicated or impaired condition); DC \u00b6\n22(c) (habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired judgment, regardless of\nwhether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent), and DC \u00b6 22(d)\n(diagnosis by a duly qualified medical professional (e.g. physician, clinical psychologist, or\npsychiatrist) of alcohol abuse or alcohol dependence).  Applicant admitted he started drinking in high\nschool and drank to the point of intoxication an average of two to four times a week from 1996 to\n2006.  That is habitual and binge drinking.  Applicant was arrested twice for driving under the\ninfluence of alcohol.  He was fired from his job at a country club for arriving late for work with the\nsmell and affects of drinking alcohol the previous night.  He was treated and diagnosed at a substance\nabuse treatment facility for alcohol dependence.  It is clearly established there is a security concern for\nApplicant\u2019s consumption of alcohol.\nApplicant\u2019s admitted use of marijuana, ecstacy, cocaine, and mushrooms raises Drug\nInvolvement DC \u00b6 25(a) (any drug abuse); DC \u00b625(b) (testing positive for illegal drug use); DC \u00b6\n25(d) (diagnosis by a duly qualified medical professional (e.g. physician, clinical psychologist, or\npsychiatrist) of drug abuse or drug dependence); and DC \u00b6 25(e) (evaluation of drug abuse or drug\ndependence by a licensed clinical social worker who is a staff member of a recognized drug treatment\n\n8\nprogram).  Applicant used marijuana in high school, and marijuana, cocaine, mushrooms, and ecstacy\nin college.  He continued to use cocaine until he entered a treatment facility in March 2006.  There,\nhe was diagnosed as opiate dependent.  The security concern for drug involvement is clearly\nestablished.\nThe mitigating conditions for alcohol consumption and drug involvement are similar since the\nsecurity concerns arise from the abuse of a substance.  I considered Alcohol Consumption Mitigating\nCondition (MC) \u00b6 23(a) (so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it happened\nunder such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s\ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment); and MC \u00b6 23(b) (the individual acknowledges\nhis or her alcoholism or issues of alcohol abuse, provides evidence of action taken to overcome this\nproblem, and has established a patter of abstinence (if alcohol dependent) or responsible use (if an\nalcohol abuser).  I considered Drug Involvement MC \u00b6 26(a) (the behavior happened so long ago, was\nso infrequent, or happened under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt\non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment); MC \u00b6 26(b) (a\ndemonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future, such as: (1) disassociation or avoiding drug-\nusing associates and contacts; (2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; (3)\nan appropriate period of abstinence; ((4) a signed statement of intent with automatic revocation of\nclearance for any violation);and MC \u00b6 26(d) (satisfactory completion of a prescribed drug treatment\nprogram, including but not limited to rehabilitation and aftercare requirements, without recurrence\nof abuse, and a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified medical professional).\nThese mitigating conditions were also considered together with the \u201cwhole person concept\u201d.\nI considered (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding\nthe conduct, to include knowledgeable participation, (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct, (4)\nthe Applicant\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct, (5) the voluntariness of participation, (6)\nthe presence or absence of rehabilitation or other pertinent behavioral changes, (7) the motivation for\nthe conduct, (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress, and (9) the likelihood of\ncontinuation or recurrence.  \nI considered Applicant\u2019s candor and honesty about his drug and alcohol abuse, that he sought\ntreatment on his own because he realized he had reached a low point in his life, his young age when\nhe started abusing drugs and alcohol, his now gained maturity, and his continued aggressive treatment\nof his abuse problems.  Applicant acknowledges he is an alcoholic and was drug dependent.  It is\nextremely commendable that he has taken his abuse seriously and is working very hard to overcome\nhis problems.  He has changed his environment and actively continues his treatment to overcome his\nproblems.  He changed his living environment and his circle of friends, now depending only on family.\nHe has established a pattern of abstinence from alcohol and drugs for over a year.  All of these positive\nfactors must be balanced against Applicant\u2019s heavy abuse of drugs and alcohol for ten years.  His last\nabuse of alcohol or drugs was only about a year ago.  It is also important to note that he lied on his\nsecurity application about his drug abuse.  This is a serious issue relating to his trustworthiness and\nreliability, even though he completed the application prior to commencing his in-patient treatment for\nhis substance abuse.  At this point, there is limited evidence to conclude that the abuse will not recur.\nGiven his extensive history of abuse, insufficient time has passed from his treatment and starting\nabstinence.  There is still doubt about his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment.\nApplicant\u2019s past alcohol consumption and drug abuse still raises a security concern.  More time of\nsobriety and freedom from drug abuse is needed for Applicant to meet his burden of showing\n\n9\nreliability, good judgment, and trustworthiness for access to classified information.   Applicant has not\nmitigated security concerns for his alcohol and drug abuse, and his act of deliberately lying about the\nabuse.  Clearance is denied.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations in the SOR, as required by Section\nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline G:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a.:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b.:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c.:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d.:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e.:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f.:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline H:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a.:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b.:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.c.:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.d.:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.e.:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 3, Guideline E:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 3.a.:\nAgainst Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly\nconsistent with the national security to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.

    "summary": "FINDINGS OF FACT The following Findings of Fact are based on Applicant's Answer to the SOR, the documents and the live testimony. The Applicant is 45 years of age, and is employed by a defense contractor who seeks a security clearance on behalf of the Applicant. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of the same, I make the following additional findings of fact. Guideline B - Foreign Influence The Applicant emigrated from Iran to the U.S. in 1984 (TR at page 37 lines 6~11). He has never returned to Iran (Id). He received both a Bachelors and Masters Degree from an American university (TR at page 43 lines 5~13). He became a U.S. citizen in 1992 (Government Exhibit (GX 1 at page 1). His wife and two children are also Americans (TR at page 38 lines 11~17). 3 1.a. and 1.g. The Applicant\u2019s 65 year old mother is a citizen of and resides in Iran (TR at page 40 lines 8~12, and GX 1 at page 4). She has always been a housewife, and has never worked for the Iranian government (TR at page 50 lines 11~19). He speaks with her \u201ctwo to three times a year\u201d (TR at page 42 lines 17~22). The Applicant borrowed money from his mother so he could emigrate to the U.S. (TR at page 39 line 20 to page 40 line 7). He has since paid her back, \u201cfour or five years ago (TR at page 58 line 11 to page 59 line 1). 1.b.~1.d. The Applicant has three siblings who reside in France (GX 1 at pages 4 and 6).

    "full_text": "KEYWORD: Foreign Influence\nDIGEST: The Applicant\u2019s mother and four of his siblings are citizens of and reside in Iran.  He\nalso has three siblings who reside in France.  However, the Applicant has lived in the U.S. since\nemigrating from Iran in1984.  He has never returned to Iran, and he became a U.S. citizen in\n1992.  His wife and two children are all Americans.

CEFOLA\nAPPEARANCES\nFOR GOVERNMENT\nJeff A. Nagel, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nAlan V. Edmunds, Esquire, Applicant\u2019s Counsel\n\n2\nSYNOPSIS\nThe Applicant\u2019s mother and four of his siblings are citizens of and reside in Iran.  He also\nhas three siblings who reside in France.  However, the Applicant has lived in the U.S. since\nemigrating from Iran in1984.  He has never returned to Iran, and he became a U.S. citizen in 1992.\nHis wife and two children are all Americans.  The Applicant obtained both a Bachelors and Masters\nDegree from an American university.  He has also held a security clearance for about ten years.  His\nsupervisors and co-workers think most highly of the Appellant, and do recommend that he continue\nto hold said clearance.  Mitigation is shown.  Clearance is granted.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn January 30, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to\nExecutive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2,\n1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant, which detailed the reasons why DOHA\ncould not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant and\nrecommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether a clearance should be denied\nor revoked.\nApplicant filed an Answer to the SOR on February 23, 2007.\nThe case was received by the undersigned on March 15, 2007.  A notice of hearing was\nissued on May 1, 2007, and the case was heard on May 23, 2007.  The Government submitted\ndocumentary evidence.  Testimony was taken from the Applicant, who submitted documentary\nevidence on his behalf.  The Applicant also called three witnesses to testify.  The transcript (TR) was\nreceived on June 5, 2007.  The issues raised here are whether the Applicant's perceived Foreign\nInfluence militates against the granting of a security clearance.  [The Applicant admits all of the\nallegations of the SOR; except for the last allegation, in that he sent his mother money to repay a\nloan about four or five years ago.]\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nThe following Findings of Fact are based on Applicant's Answer to the SOR, the documents\nand the live testimony.  The Applicant is 45 years of age, and is employed by a defense contractor\nwho seeks a security clearance on behalf of the Applicant.  After a complete and thorough review\nof the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of the same, I make the following\nadditional findings of fact.\nGuideline B - Foreign Influence\nThe Applicant emigrated from Iran to the U.S. in 1984 (TR at page 37 lines 6~11).  He has\nnever returned to Iran (Id).  He received both a Bachelors and Masters Degree from an American\nuniversity (TR at page 43 lines 5~13).  He became a U.S. citizen in 1992 (Government Exhibit (GX\n1 at page 1).  His wife and two children are also Americans (TR at page 38 lines 11~17).\n\n3\n1.a. and 1.g.  The Applicant\u2019s 65 year old mother is a citizen of and resides in Iran (TR at\npage 40 lines 8~12, and GX 1 at page 4).  She has always been a housewife, and has never worked\nfor the Iranian government (TR at page 50 lines 11~19).  He speaks with her \u201ctwo to three times a\nyear\u201d (TR at page 42 lines 17~22).  The Applicant borrowed money from his mother so he could\nemigrate to the U.S. (TR at page 39 line 20 to page 40 line 7).  He has since paid her back, \u201cfour or\nfive years ago (TR at page 58 line 11 to page 59 line 1).\n1.b.~1.d.  The Applicant has three siblings who reside in France (GX 1 at pages 4 and 6).\nOne brother is a \u201ccab driver\u201d (TR at page 50 line 20 to page 52 line 1).  Another brother works with\ncomputers (TR at page 52 line 20 to page 53 line 19).  His sister works with children (TR at page\n52 lines 2~19).  None of these three siblings work for any foreign government (TR at page 50 line\n20 to page 52 line 1, at page 52 line 20 to page 53 line 19, and at page 52 lines 2~19).\n1.e. and 1.f.  The Applicant has four siblings who are citizens of and reside in Iran (GX 1 at\npages 5~6).  The Applicant has had little contact with one brother, and does not know what his\noccupation is, if any (TR at page 54 lines 1~19).  Another brother has a business, \u201clike an ice cream\nparlor\u201d (TR at page 54 line 20 to page 55 line 17).  The Applicant also has two sisters.  One sister\nis a retired teacher, and the other works in the health care sector (TR at page 55 line 18 to page 58\nline 5).  To his knowledge, none of the Applicant\u2019s Iranian siblings works for the Iranian government\n(TR at page 54 line 20 to page 55 line 17, and at page 55 line 18 to page 58 line 5).\nThe Applicant would report any attempt at coercion vis-a-vis any of his foreign relatives to\nappropriate authorities (TR at page 38 line 8 to page 39 line 12).\nIran is a state that sponsors terrorism.  The U.S. has not had diplomatic relations with Iran\nsince 1980.  It is a theocratic Islamic republic in which Shi\u2019a Muslim clergy dominate the key power\nstructures, and ultimate political authority is vested is a learned religious scholar.  Iran\u2019s dismal and\nworsening human rights record presents a further threat to the U.S., as a large number of Iranians\nemigrated to the U.S. in 1979, after their Islamic revolution.  These immigrants often left behind\nfamily members in Iran.  Iran\u2019s security forces often target family members of political prisoners for\nharassment purposes.\nPOLICIES\nEnclosure 2 and Section E.2.2. of the 1992 Directive set forth both policy factors, and\nconditions that could raise or mitigate a security concern.  Furthermore, as set forth in the Directive,\neach clearance decision must be a fair and impartial common sense determination based upon\nconsideration of all the relevant and material information and the pertinent criteria and adjudication\npolicy in enclosure 2, including as appropriate:\na. Nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct, and surrounding\ncircumstances.\nb. Frequency and recency of the conduct.\nc. Age and maturity of the applicant.\n\n4\nd. Motivation of the applicant, and the extent to which the conduct\nwas negligent, willful, voluntary, or undertaken with knowledge of\nthe consequence involved.\ne. Absence or presence of rehabilitation.\n\n5\nf. Probability that circumstances or conduct will continue or recur in\nthe future.\u201d\nThe Administrative Judge, however, can only draw those inferences or conclusions that have\na reasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record.  The Judge cannot draw inferences or\nconclusions based on evidence that is speculative or conjectural in nature.\nThe Government must make out a case under Guideline B (Foreign Influence), which\nestablishes doubt about a person's judgment, reliability and trustworthiness.  While a rational\nconnection, or nexus, must be shown between an applicant's adverse conduct and his ability to\neffectively safeguard classified information, with respect to sufficiency of proof of a rational\nconnection, objective or direct evidence is not required.\nThen, the Applicant must remove that doubt with substantial evidence in refutation,\nexplanation, mitigation or extenuation, which demonstrates that the past adverse conduct is unlikely\nto be repeated, and that the Applicant presently qualifies for a security clearance.\nAn individual who is subject to Foreign Influence, may be prone to provide information or\nmake decisions that are harmful to the interests of the United States.  The Government must be able\nto place a high degree of confidence in a security clearance holder to abide by all security rules and\nregulations at all times and in all places.\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe Applicant's mother, and four of his siblings, are citizens of and reside in Iran.  He also\nhas three other siblings who reside in France.  The first and second disqualifying conditions are\narguably applicable as this contact \u201ccreates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement,\nmanipulation, pressure, or coercion,\" and creates \u201ca potential conflict of interests between the\nindividual\u2019s obligation to protect sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s desire to\nhelp a foreign person . . . by providing that information.\u201d  Under the facts of this particular case,\nhowever, these are clearly countered by the first and second mitigating conditions.  The nature of the\nApplicant\u2019s relationship with his Iranian and French relatives is \u201csuch that it is unlikely the\nindividual will be placed in a position of having to choose between the interests of . . . [his family]\nand the interests of the U.S.\u201d  Also, the Applicant \u201chas such deep and longstanding relationships and\nloyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor\nof the U.S. interest.\u201d\nFurthermore, I am not limited to the mitigating conditions, delineated in the Directive, in\ndeciding if an Applicant has demonstrated extenuation or mitigation.  Those who know and work\nwith the Applicant think most highly of him, and recommend that he retain his security clearance.\nThe totality of the Applicant\u2019s conduct and circumstances, as set forth at length above, clearly\nwarrants a favorable recommendation under the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d  Mitigation is shown.\nGuideline B is found for the Applicant.\n\n6\nConsidering all the evidence, the Applicant has rebutted the Government's case regarding his\nalleged Foreign Influence.  The Applicant has thus met the mitigating conditions of Guideline B, and\nof Section E.2.2. of the Directive.  Accordingly, he has met his ultimate burden of persuasion under\nGuideline B.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal Findings required by paragraph 25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive are:\nParagraph 1: Foreign Preference\nFOR THE APPLICANT\na.   For the Applicant.\nb.   For the Applicant.\nc.   For the Applicant.\nd.   For the Applicant.\ne.   For the Applicant.\nf.   For the Applicant.\ng.   For the Applicant.\nFactual support and reasons for the foregoing are set forth in FINDINGS OF FACT and\nCONCLUSIONS, supra.\nDECISION\nIn light of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly consistent with\nthe national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant.\nRichard A.

Of added security concern are\nApplicant\u2019s understatements of his amphetamine use in the security clearance application he\ncompleted in January 2006.  His recurrent history of methamphetamine use and understated use in\nhis security clearance application are not  mitigated under Guidelines H and E.  Clearance is denied.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn April 26, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to\nExecutive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2,\n1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, which detailed reasons why DOHA could\nnot make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant, and recommended referral\nto an administrative judge to determine whether his clearance should be granted, continued, denied\nor revoked.\nApplicant responded to the SOR on May 26, 2007, and requested a hearing.  The case was\nassigned to me on June 22, 2007, and was scheduled for hearing on July 26, 2007.  A hearing was\nJuly 26, 2007, for the purpose of considering whether it would be clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant, continue, deny, or revoke Applicant\u2019s security clearance.  At hearing, the\nGovernment's case consisted of two exhibits; Applicant relied on one witness (himself) and no\nexhibits.  The transcript (R.T.) was received on August 8, 2007.\nPROCEDURAL ISSUES\nBefore the close of the hearing, Applicant requested leave to keep the record open to permit\nhim the opportunity to supplement the record with treatment records from his outpatient treatment\nprovider.  For good cause shown, Applicant was granted seven days to supplement the record.  The\nGovernment, in turn was allowed seven days to respond.  Within the time permitted, Applicant\nfurnished a discharge summary from his most recent CR drug treatment provider.  There being no\nobjection from the Government, and good cause demonstrated, Applicant\u2019s discharge summary is\nadmitted as Applicant\u2019s exhibit A.\nSUMMARY OF PLEADINGS\nUnder Guideline H, Applicant is alleged to have (a) used amphetamines, with varying\nfrequency, from approximately 1984 until at least February 2006, (b) attended substance abuse\ntreatment at the Ex Group between February and July 2006, and (c) been fired from his previous\nemployment following a positive drug test in approximately March 2004. \n\n3\nUnder Guideline E, Applicant is alleged to have (a) falsified his security clearance\napplication (SF-86) of January 2006 by falsely understating his use of controlled substances. \nFor his response to the SOR, Applicant admitted misusing prescription drugs, attending\nsubstance abuse treatment with the Ex Group, and being fired by a previous employer following a\npositive drug test in 2004.  However, he denied ever falsifying his security clearance application.\n \nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant is a 40-year-old truck driver for a defense contractor who seeks a security\nclearance.  The allegations covered in the SOR and admitted to by Applicant are incorporated herein\nby reference and adopted as relevant and material findings.  Additional findings follow.\nApplicant is married with three children: ages eleven, eight and three (R.T., at 23).  He  began\nusing methamphetamines at the age of 17.  He attributes youth and curiosity to his introduction to\nthe drug, and used it occasionally in high school.  After a short period of avoidance after high school,\nhe resumed his use of the substance.  During his 20s he used methamphetamines once every six\nmonths (R.T. , at 24).  He increased his use of the substance to monthly use during his 30s,\nexpending $40.00 a setting on purchases of the substance (R.T., at 24).\nApplicant tried several times, without success, to quit his drug use.  In 1999 he entered an\ninpatient substance abuse program.  After less than a month in the program he was detected\ngambling and was discharged without completing the program (R.T., at 30-32).  \nIn March 2004, while employed by another employer, Applicant tested positive for\nmethamphetamine (R.T., at 27) and was subsequently fired by his employer (albeit for performance,\nand not for drug reasons).   He attributes his abuse of methamphetamine to marital problems with\nhis wife.  At his wife\u2019s urging, he enrolled in a recognized outpatient program (Ex) in February 2006\n(R.T., at 29).  He was diagnosed as drug dependent by his Ex treatment counselor and continued in\nthe program for several months before he quit attending treatment sessions (see ex. 2; R.T., at 29).\nIn May 2004, he withdrew from the Ex program altogether after telling his treatment counselors he\nwas still using methamphetamine (see ex. 2; R.T., at 29, 36-37).  Applicant estimates to have used\nmethamphetamine on a weekly basis for two years prior to his entering the Ex program (R.T., at 48-\n50).  He paid for his methamphetamine drugs between this 2002-2005, and raised the cash for his\npurchases.\nBefore joining his current employer in October 2005, Applicant estimates to have used meth-\namphetamines on a weekly basis for at least two years (R.T., at 48-49).  Over his wife\u2019s objections,\nhe continued to use amphetamine drugs even after going to work for his current employer.\nIn July 2006, Applicant enrolled in a faith based four-month inpatient program (CR), which\nis characterized as a mission life skills substance abuse program.  Upon admission to CR, he was\ndiagnosed with substance dependence (for methamphetamine) under the DSM-IV-TR (see ex. A).\nAfter being detoxed on the first day of his stay, he spent the ensuing 90 to 100 days at the program\u2019s\n\n4\nfacility in group treatment (concentrating on changing his life), in addition to attending individual\nweekly counseling sessions and 12-step meetings, and completing his reading assignments (see ex.\nA).  After discharge, CR recommended that Applicant attend no less than three weekly meetings of\nAlcoholics Anonymous (AA) or Narcotics Anonymous (90 meeting in 90 days) and talk to his\nsponsor weekly during his stay with the facility (see ex. A; R.T., at 40).  Applicant has complied with\nthese AA/NA aftercare recommendations and continues to attend AA meetings to ensure his\nabstinence (R.T., at 40-41).\nApplicant documents his successful completion of the CR inpatient program in December\n2006 (see ex. A; R.T., at 33-36).  CR\u2019s exit diagnosis noted no change in its initial dependence\ndiagnosis but credited Applicant with the necessary changes to maintain his sobriety (see ex. A).  He\nhas not used methamphetamine since his discharge and still  to attend AA meetings (R.T., at 35-36).\nApplicant\u2019s credits his CR inpatient care to helping him to love God and himself more than\nhe was ever able to do for himself. With his continued AA/NA attendance and support from his\nsponsor and other AA/NA members, Applicant continues to make progress with his drug problem.\n \nApplicant completed an SF-86 in January 2006.  When responding to question 24a, he listed\nhis use of methamphetamines between February 2004 and March 2004, but omitted any other use.\nApplicant attributes his understated use to his concerns over being denied a job with E-3 (R.T., at\n37-38).  When subsequently interviewed by an OPM investigator Applicant initially informed the\ninvestigator that he had used methamphetamine on two to three occasions between February and\nMarch 2004 (R.T., at 39).  Only after he was confronted by the investigator did Applicant disclose\nhis more extensive use of amphetamines (R.T., at 39).  \nPOLICIES\nThe revised Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified\nInformation (effective September 2006) list Guidelines to be considered by judges in the decision\nmaking process covering DOHA cases.  These Guidelines require the judge to consider all of the\n\"Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying\u201d (Disqualifying\nConditions), if any, and all of the Mitigating Conditions, if any, before deciding whether or not a\nsecurity clearance should be granted, continued or denied.  The Guidelines do not require the judge\nto assess these factors exclusively in arriving at a decision.  In addition to the relevant Adjudicative\nGuidelines, judges must take into account the pertinent considerations for assessing extenuation and\nmitigation set forth in E.2.2 of the Adjudicative Process of Enclosure 2 of the Directive, which are\nintended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and impartial common sense decision.\nViewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following adjudication policy factors\nare pertinent herein:\nDrug Involvement\nThe Concern: Improper or illegal involvement with drugs raises questions regarding an individual\u2019s\nwillingness or ability to protect classified information.  Drug abuse or dependence may impair social\n\n5\nor occupational functioning, increasing the risk of an unauthorized disclosure of classified\ninformation.\nPersonal Conduct\nThe Concern: Conduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of\ncandor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions about\nan individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information.  Of special\ninterest is any failure to provide truthful and candid answers during the security clearance process\nor any other failure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \nBurden of Proof\nBy virtue of the precepts framed by the revised Adjudicative Guidelines, a decision to grant\nor continue an applicant's security clearance may be made only upon a threshold finding that to do\nso is clearly consistent with the national interest.  Because the Directive requires Administrative\nJudges to make a common sense appraisal of the evidence accumulated in the record, the ultimate\ndetermination of an applicant's eligibility for a security clearance depends, in large part, on the\nrelevance and materiality of that evidence.  As with all adversary proceedings, the Judge may draw\nonly those inferences which have a reasonable and logical basis from the evidence of record.\nConversely, the Judge cannot draw factual inferences that are grounded on speculation or conjecture.\nThe Government's initial burden is twofold: (1) It must prove any controverted fact[s] alleged\nin the Statement of Reasons and (2) it must demonstrate that the facts proven have a material bearing\nto the applicant's eligibility to obtain or maintain a security clearance.  The required showing of\nmaterial bearing, however, does not require the Government to affirmatively demonstrate that the\napplicant has actually mishandled or abused classified information before it can deny or revoke a\nsecurity clearance. Rather, consideration must take account of cognizable risks that an applicant may\ndeliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information.\nOnce the Government meets its initial burden of proof of establishing admitted or\ncontroverted facts, the burden of persuasion shifts to the applicant for the purpose of establishing his\nor her security worthiness through evidence of refutation, extenuation or mitigation of the\nGovernment's case.\nCONCLUSIONS\nApplicant has a long history of amphetamine use, and more recently was diagnosed as\namphetamine dependent by a treatment facility.  Applicant\u2019s recurrent involvement with illegal\nsubstances over a 22-year period, coupled with his understated drug use in the SF-86 he completed\nin January 2006 while in the employ of his current employer, raise security significant issues about\nhis judgment, reliability and trustworthiness. \nDrug issues\n\n6\nBy his own acknowledgments, Applicant\u2019s methamphetamine use has been a steady\nprogression since he returned to using the substance following a brief period of abstinence after high\nschool.  Between 2002 and 2006, he used the substance on a weekly basis.  He continued to use the\nsubstance, even testing positive for the drug with his prior employer in 2004, and he was later\ndiagnosed as methamphetamine dependent.  Introduced to methamphetamine in high school, he\nexperimented with other drugs briefly after high school (notably cocaine) before settling on\nmethamphetamine as his drug of choice.  He enjoyed recurrent periods of reduced drug usage before\ncommitting to regular usage during the 2002-2006 time frame. \nApplicant's recurrent  use of methamphetamine is sufficient to invoke four of the\ndisqualifying conditions of the Adjudicative Guidelines for drugs, i.e., DC 25(a) (any drug abuse),\nDC 25(b) (testing positive for illegal drug use), DC 25(c) (illegal drug possession, including\ncultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase, sale or distribution, or possession of drug\nparaphernalia), and DC 25(d) (diagnosis of a duly qualified medical professional (e.g., physician,\nclinical psychologist, or psychiatrist).  Although Applicant failed to complete his Ex program, he\nis credited with did successfully completing his subsequent CR program.  As a result, DC 25(f)\n(failure to successfully complete a drug treatment program prescribed by a duly qualified medical\nprofessional) has only limited applicability. \nApplicant has not used amphetamines since December 2006 and assures he will not use the\nsubstance in the future.  To be sure, misconduct predictions (to include return to illegal drug use),\ngenerally, may not be based on supposition or suspicion.  See ISCR Case No. 01-26893 (Appeal Bd.\nOctober 2002); ISCR Case No. 97-0356 (App. Bd.April1998).  The Appeal Board has consistently\nheld that an unfavorable credibility determination concerning an applicant is not a substitute for\nrecord evidence that the applicant used illegal drugs since his last recorded use, or based on his past\nuse he is likely to resume drug usage in the future.  See ISCR Case No. 02-08032 (Appeal Bd. May\n2004).  Based on Applicant\u2019s long history of sustained methamphetamine use, his dependence\ndiagnosis, his past minimizing of the extent of his use, and his one failed treatment program in his\nrecord, it is simply too soon to enable him to claim the benefits of any of the mitigating conditions\nof the guideline for drug involvement. \nApplicant\u2019s recently completed treatment program with CR and his assurances that his\nmethamphetamine involvement is a thing of the past must be balanced against his considerable\nhistory of recurrent use (at times quite heavy), his positive drug test with his prior employer, his\ndependence diagnosis, his understatements when asked about his drug use, and the relatively short\namount of time that has elapsed since he completed his drug treatment program with CR and ceased\nusing methamphetamine.  Considering all of the developed evidence of record, Applicant fails to\nmitigate security concerns associated with his recurrent use and possession of illegal substances.\nUnfavorable conclusions warrant with respect to sub-paragraphs 1.a through 1.c of Guideline H. \nFalsification issues\nPotentially serious and difficult  to reconcile with the trust and reliability requirements for\nholding a security clearance are the timing and circumstances of Applicant\u2019s drug use\nunderstatements in the SF-86 he completed in January 2006 and withholding of his more extensive\nusage until he was confronted in an ensuing OPM interview.  So much trust is imposed on persons\n\n7\ncleared to see classified information that deviation tolerances for candor lapses are gauged very\nnarrowly. \nMitigation is difficult to credit Applicant with,  since he failed to promptly correct his SF-86\nunderstatements before being confronted in his ensuing OPM interview.  In the past, the Appeal\nBoard has denied applicants availability of the predecessor mitigating condition of MC 17(a) (the\nindividual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, concealment, or falsification\nbefore being confronted with the facts) where the applicant has waited many months to timely\ncorrect a known omission. Compare ISCR Case No. 97-0289 (Appeal Bd. January 1998) with\nDISCR Case No. 93-1390 (Appeal Bd. January 1995).  Compounding Applicant\u2019s delayed\nacknowledgments is his withholding of his more extensive methamphetamine use until after he was\nconfronted by the OPM agent who interviewed him.\nBy minimizing his past involvement with illegal substances in his SF-86, Applicant\nconcealed materially important background information needed for the government to properly\nprocess and evaluate his security updates.  His attributed reasons for his understated drug usage (fear\nof losing his job) are not sustainable grounds for averting inferences of falsification.  Weighing all\nof the circumstances surrounding his SF-86 illegal substance understatements and lack of any\nprompt, good faith corrections, Applicant\u2019s claims lack the necessary probative showing to avert\ndrawn conclusions that he knowingly and deliberately withheld material background information\nabout his prior use of illegal substances.\nConsidering all of the evidence produced in this record and the available guidelines in the\nDirective (inclusive of the E2.2 factors), unfavorable conclusions warrant with respect to sub-\nparagraph 2.a of Guideline E.\nIn reaching my decision, I have considered the evidence as a whole, including each of the E2\n2.2 factors enumerated in the Adjudicative Guidelines of the Directive.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nIn reviewing the allegations of the SOR and ensuing conclusions reached in the context of\nthe FINDINGS OF FACT, CONCLUSIONS, CONDITIONS, and the factors listed above, I make\nthe following FORMAL FINDINGS:\nGUIDELINE H (DRUGS):\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSub-paras. 1.a - 1.c:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nGUIDELINE E (PERSONAL CONDUCT):\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSub-para. 2.a:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nDECISION\n\n8\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s security clearance.

While he has paid two judgments, paid two debts and is making payments on one debt,\nhe has not paid four judgments and five debts. He has not established a payment plan for these debts\neven though he has sufficient income to repay his indebtedness. He has not mitigated the\nGovernment\u2019s security concerns under Guideline F. Clearance is denied.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn March 15, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement\nof Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, pursuant to Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified\nInformation Within Industry, dated February 20, 1960, as amended and modified, and Department\nof Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Security Clearance Review Program (Directive),\ndated January 2, 1992, as amended and modified. The SOR detailed reasons why DOHA could not\nmake the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. Specifically, the SOR sets\nforth security concerns arising under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of the revised\nAdjudicative Guidelines (AG) issued on December 29, 2005 and implemented by the Department\nof Defense, effective September 1, 2006. DOHA recommended the case be referred to an\nadministrative judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or\nrevoked. On April 15, 2007, Applicant submitted a notarized response to the allegations. He elected\nto have his case decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. \nDepartment Counsel prepared a File of Relevant Material (FORM) and provided Applicant\nwith a complete copy on April 26, 2007. Applicant had 30 days from receipt of the FORM to file\nobjections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation. He did not submit a response\nor additional evidence. This case was assigned to me on June 28, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant admitted the allegations under Guideline F, subparagraphs 1,a, 1.b, 1.d, 1.e, 1.g,\n1.h, and 1.l of the SOR.  He denied the remaining allegations. Those admissions are incorporated\n1\nas findings of fact.  After a complete review of the evidence in the record and upon due\n2\nconsideration, I make the following findings of fact.\nApplicant is 42-years-old and works as a test engineer for a Department of Defense\ncontractor, a job he has held for almost 3 years.

He remarried in 2004.3\nApplicant\u2019s monthly gross income from his full-time job totals approximately $4,327, plus\n$170 from a part-time position. His net monthly pay from both jobs totals approximately $3,415,\nplus $931 in monthly retirement benefits for a net monthly income of $4,346. His estimated monthly\nexpenses total $2,500, leaving approximately $1,800 a month to pay his debts.

Likewise, he has presented no evidence that he\npaid his five outstanding debts or that he met with or is working with a counseling service to resolve\nhis remaining debts.\nPOLICIES\nThe revised Adjudicative Guidelines set forth disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating\nconditions (MC) applicable to each specific guideline. An administrative judge need not view the\nrevised adjudicative guidelines as inflexible ironclad rules of law. Instead, acknowledging the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines, are intended to assist the administrative judge in\nreaching fair and impartial common sense decisions. Although the presence or absence of a particular\ncondition or factor for or against clearance is not outcome determinative, the revised AG should be\nfollowed whenever a case can be measured against this policy guidance. In addition, each security\nclearance decision must be based on the relevant and material facts and circumstances, the whole-\nperson concept, and the factors listed in the Directive. Specifically, these are: (1) the nature, extent,\nand seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct; (3) the frequency and\nrecency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the\nvoluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other behavioral\nchanges; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.7\nThe sole purpose of a security clearance determination is to decide if it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for an applicant.  The government\n8\nhas the burden of proving controverted facts.  The burden of proof is something less than a\n9\npreponderance of the evidence.  Once the government has met its burden, the burden shifts to the\n10\napplicant to present evidence of refutation, extenuation, or mitigation to overcome the case against\nhim.  Additionally, an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable\n11\nclearance decision.12\n\nEgan, 484 U.S. at 531.\n13\nId.\n14\nId.; Directive, revised AG \u00b6 2(b).\n15\nExecutive Order No. 10865 \u00a7 7.\n16\n5\nNo one has a right to a security clearance,  and \u201cthe clearly consistent standard indicates that\n13\nsecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d  Any reasonable\n14\ndoubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access to sensitive information must be resolved\nin favor of protecting such sensitive information.  Section 7 of Executive Order 10865 specifically\n15\nprovides industrial security clearance decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall\nin no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d The decision to deny an\nindividual a security clearance is not necessarily a determination as to the allegiance, loyalty, and\npatriotism of an applicant.  It is merely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict\n16\nguidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance.\nCONCLUSIONS\nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all appropriate\nadjudicative factors, I conclude the following with respect to the allegations set forth in the SOR:\nFinancial Considerations\nUnder Guideline F, the \u201cfailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by\nrules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability,\ntrustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. An individual who is financially\noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.\u201d (AG \u00b6 18.) The credit\nreports reflect several old, large, unpaid debts and judgments. Because of the age of these debts and\njudgments and their delinquent status, Applicant showed a long term inability or unwillingness to\npay his debts. Based on the evidence of record, the Government established the applicability of DC\n\u00b6 19 (a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts and DC \u00b6 19 (c) a history of not meeting financial\nobligations.\nI have considered all the mitigating conditions under Guideline F. Although two judgments\nand one debt have been paid and one is being paid, I conclude that the mitigating conditions do not\napply to his remaining unpaid debts and judgments. Applicant has many old debts and judgments.\nHe has not provided an explanation for his indebtedness or for why he has not paid his indebtedness.\nHe has not contacted a financial counseling service to help resolve his debts, nor has he established\na repayment plan with his judgment creditors. He has not shown that his debts occurred because of\nfactors beyond his control. Thus, MC \u00b6 26 (a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent,\nor occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the\nindividual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; MC \u00b6 26 (b) the conditions that\nresulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment,\na business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the\n\n6\nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; MC \u00b6 20 (c) the person has received or is\nreceiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being\nresolved or is under control; MC \u00b6 20 (d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay\noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; MC \u00b6 20 (e) the individual has a reasonable basis to\ndispute the legitimacy of the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides\ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions to resolve\nthe issue and MC \u00b6 20(f) the affluence resulted from a legal source do not apply.\nWhole Person Analysis\nProtection of our national security is of paramount concern. Security clearance decisions are\nnot intended to assign guilt or to impose further punishment for past transgressions. Rather, the\nobjective of the adjudicative process is the fair-minded, commonsense assessment of a person\u2019s\ntrustworthiness and fitness for access to classified information. Thus, in reaching this decision, I\nhave considered the whole person concept in evaluating Appellant\u2019s risk and vulnerability in\nprotecting our national interests.\nApplicant served honorably in the Navy for 20 years. From the meager information in the\nrecord, it appears that his current finances are well managed. He has sufficient monthly income to\nrepay his smaller debts and to develop an overall repayment plan for his larger debts. He has not\ndone so. He may be pressured to engage in illegal acts either to pay the judgments or because the\njudgments may be viewed as bad mark against him.\nI have carefully weighed the mitigating factors in this case, Applicant\u2019s honorable service\nwhile a member of the military, his present income management against his unpaid outstanding debts\nand judgments and concluded that he has not mitigated the Government\u2019s security concerns about\nhis finances. Accordingly, Guideline F is found against Applicant.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required\nby Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nSOR \u00b6 1-Guideline F :\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph a: \nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph b: \nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph c: \nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph d: \nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph e: \nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph f: \nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph g: \nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph h: \nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph i: \nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph j: \nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph k: \nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph l: \nAgainst Applicant\n\n7\nSubparagraph m: \nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph n: \nAgainst Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant a security clearance for Applicant.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact In the SOR, as amended, DOHA alleges under Guideline C, Foreign Preference, that as of December 14, 2006, Applicant exercised dual citizenship with the U.K. and U.S. by possessing a valid U.K. passport that does not expire until March 9, 2010 (SOR \u00b6 1.a). Under Guideline B, Foreign Influence, Applicant is alleged to own as of December 14, 2006, 376,492 shares of stock worth about $3,326,758.61 in a U.K. company (SOR \u00b6 2.a) and to maintain a bank account in England with about $98,529.34 on deposit (SOR \u00b6 2.b). Guideline L, Outside Activities, concerns are also alleged related to his stock ownership (SOR \u00b6 3.a) in the U.K. company, and his father\u2019s status as cofounder and current consultant of the U.K. company (SOR \u00b6 3.b). Applicant did not deny the allegations, but submitted changed circumstances (stock sale, surrender of his foreign passport) justify de novo review of his case.

On March 13, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued\na Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under Guideline C and\nGuideline L for Applicant.  The action was taken under Executive Order 10865,\n1\nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended;\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised\nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and\neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on March 19, 2007. He answered\nthe SOR in writing on March 22, 2007, and requested a hearing before an\nAdministrative Judge. DOHA received Applicant\u2019s response on March 26, 2007. On\nJanuary 18, 2008\n\nDue to an apparent miscommunication between the parties, I was not provided with Applicant\u2019s response until\n2\nhis December 11, 2007, hearing.\n2\nApril 23, 2007, Applicant separated from the employer who had sponsored his need for\na security clearance. Later that week, he began working for his present employer and\nthe request for clearance for him was transferred.\nOn October 2, 2007, Department Counsel indicated the government was\nprepared to proceed, but she also moved to amend the SOR. The case was assigned to\nme on October 10, 2007. On October 18, 2007, I gave Applicant until November 2,\n2007, to respond to the proposed amendments to the SOR.\nOn November 1, 2007, counsel for Applicant entered his appearance. On\nNovember 2, 2007, Applicant responded to the allegations set forth in the motion to\namend.  On November 13, 2007, I scheduled a hearing for December 11, 2007.\n2\nThe hearing was convened as scheduled. Before the introduction of any\nevidence, I granted the Government\u2019s motion and amended the SOR. Four Government\nexhibits (Ex. 1-4) and ten Applicant exhibits (Ex. A-J) were admitted and Applicant\ntestified, as reflected in a hearing transcript (Tr.) received on December 21, 2007.\nBased upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for\naccess to classified information is granted.\nProcedural and Evidentiary Rulings\nMotion to Amend SOR \nIn the SOR, DOHA alleged under Guideline C that Applicant exercises dual\ncitizenship with the United Kingdom (U.K.) and the U.S. (SOR \u00b6 1.a), possessed a U.K.\npassport issued on March 9, 2000 (\u00b6 1.b), owns approximately 376,492 shares worth\n$3,326,758.61 in a U.K. company (\u00b6 1.c), and has about $98,529.34 on deposit in a\nbank account in England (\u00b6 1.d). DOHA alleged under Guideline L Applicant\u2019s stock\nownership in the U.K. company (\u00b6 2.a) that his father co-founded and currently works\nfor as a consultant (\u00b6 2.b). On October 2, 2007, Department Counsel moved to allege\nunder a redrafted \u00b6 1.a that Applicant exercised dual citizenship as of December 14,\n2006, by possessing the U.K. passport; to allege under a new Guideline B rather than\nunder Guideline C his foreign stock ownership (\u00b6 2.a) and foreign bank deposits (\u00b6 2.b);\nand to allege the Guideline L concerns under \u00b6 3.\nApplicant, through counsel, did not object to the motion. He indicated that he\nwould be surrendering custody of his U.K. passport to his employer, had sold all his\nstock in the U.K. company effective November 12, 2007, and would be closing his U.K.\nbank account on settlement of the stock sale. After reviewing the Applicant\u2019s response,\nthe motion to amend was granted. Applicant was deemed to have answered the SOR\nallegations as set forth in his November 2, 2007, response to the motion.\n\nApplicant did not actively trade his shares (Tr. 37), although he exercised shareholder voting rights by proxy\n3\nthrough his father (Tr. 78).\n3\nFindings of Fact\nIn the SOR, as amended, DOHA alleges under Guideline C, Foreign Preference,\nthat as of December 14, 2006, Applicant exercised dual citizenship with the U.K. and\nU.S. by possessing a valid U.K. passport that does not expire until March 9, 2010 (SOR\n\u00b6 1.a). Under Guideline B, Foreign Influence, Applicant is alleged to own as of\nDecember 14, 2006, 376,492 shares of stock worth about $3,326,758.61 in a U.K.\ncompany (SOR \u00b6 2.a) and to maintain a bank account in England with about $98,529.34\non deposit (SOR \u00b6 2.b). Guideline L, Outside Activities, concerns are also alleged\nrelated to his stock ownership (SOR \u00b6 3.a) in the U.K. company, and his father\u2019s status\nas cofounder and current consultant of the U.K. company (SOR \u00b6 3.b). Applicant did not\ndeny the allegations, but submitted changed circumstances (stock sale, surrender of his\nforeign passport) justify de novo review of his case. After consideration of the evidence\nof record, I make the following findings of fact:\nApplicant is a 45-year-old senior engineer with a doctorate degree from a British\nuniversity. He seeks his first security clearance.\nA U.K. native, Applicant was raised and educated in the U.K. where his mother\nwas a schoolteacher until she retired, and his father worked as a chief electrical\nengineer for a large instrument company until 1971. With the company experiencing\ncutbacks in design and development activities, his father and six of his father\u2019s\ncoworkers started their own measurement technologies\u2019 company in 1971. On the\ncompany\u2019s initial public offering, Applicant was issued publicly traded stock\nproportionate to his holdings in the company co-founded by his father. The company\npaid dividends that Applicant had deposited directly into a bank account in the U.K.\nmaintained for that purpose.\nIn the mid-1970s, the company established a worldwide distribution/agency\nnetwork as it became a leader in the development and provider of intrinsic safety\nexplosion protection devices and physical layer components for the process control\nindustry. Through product innovations and corporate acquisitions, the company\ncontinued to expand its products and worldwide presence as sales increased. As of late\n2006, the company had five business divisions with direct operations in 14 countries\n(five production plants and multiple sales and support operations). Additional corporate\nacquisitions in 2007 added products unrelated to Applicant\u2019s work in the defense\nindustry. (Ex. 3, Ex. 4)\nApplicant pursued his own life as the value of his shares in the measurement\ninstrument technologies company continued to grow.  While in college, Applicant\n3\nmarried a U.K. native citizen in September 1982. They had three children together, sons\nborn in May 1988 and December 1991, and a daughter born in April 1990. After earning\nhis doctorate degree in physical chemistry in June 1992, Applicant and his immediate\n\nApplicant has one surviving sibling, who is a resident citizen of the U.K. where she operates a horticultural\n4\nbusiness.  (Ex. 1; Tr. 38) \n4\nfamily moved to Canada where he began working as a visiting scientist for the\nCanadian government. Academic in nature, his work involved the spectroscopy of small\ndiatomic molecules in the atmosphere for clues as to the origin of the universe and\ndynamics of matter in the universe. (Tr. 80) From 1994 to 1995, Applicant also\nperformed part-time consulting work for his father\u2019s company in the U..K., preparing a\ndatabase of the company\u2019s products and their utilities. (Tr. 76)\nHe and his first wife experienced marital difficulties, and they divorced in June\n1995. On his legal separation in 1994, Applicant was required to give his ex-wife half of\nhis stock holdings. She sold her share immediately, and Applicant was reissued a new\ncertificate for the balance of his holdings. The certificate was mailed to his former\nresidence in the U.K. Living in Canada at the time, Applicant possessed contract notes\nbut never received the certificate showing the remaining balance of his holdings. (Tr.\n70)\nIn April 1997, Applicant was granted sole custody of his older son, who is\nseverely autistic. Applicant placed his son in a residential facility for autistic children in\nthe U.S. (Tr. 39). In May 1997, Applicant began employment for a U.S. private university\nnearby, as a visiting scientist at its center for astrophysics. From September 1998 to\nApril 2000, Applicant was a postdoctoral research fellow at a public university in the\nU.S.\n On March 9, 2000, Applicant renewed his U.K. passport for another ten years.\n(Ex. 2) Later that month, Applicant married his current spouse. By virtue of his marriage\nto a native U.S. citizen, he acquired U.S. permanent residence status in late October\n2000. From November 2000 to January 2002, Applicant worked as a senior engineer for\na U.S. company. Following six months of unemployment, he secured a position as a\nsenior engineer with a new company and stayed on at the same facility under a new\nemployer effective May 2003.\nIn January 2005, Applicant became a U.S. citizen, taking an oath to renounce all\nforeign allegiances, to support and defend the U.S. Constitution and its laws, and to\nbear arms or perform noncombatant service or civilian service on behalf of the U.S. if\nrequired. Applicant took no action to formally renounce his U.K. citizenship or return his\nU.K. passport, which does not expire until March 2010. In February 2005, Applicant was\nissued his U.S. passport. Thereafter he traveled exclusively on his U.S. passport,\nincluding on numerous trips to Canada to see his children and on trips to the U.K. to\nvisit his parents and sister in July 2005, December 2005, and July 2006.4\nOn August 25, 2005, Applicant applied for a security clearance for potential\nduties on projects for the U.S. military. On his questionnaire for investigations\nprocessing (e-QIP), Applicant disclosed his dual citizenship with the U.S. and U.K., his\npossession of U.S. and U.K. passports, the dual citizenship (Canada and U.K.) and\n\nThe evidence is inconclusive as to when Applicant became a shareholder. Applicant testified that in 1971,\n5\nwhen he was nine, he was given holdings (privately held stock certificates) in the company by his father (Tr.\n66). He was issued a proportionate share of publicly trading stock on the initial public offering (Tr. 37, 66-67).\nIn response to DOHA interrogatories, Applicant indicated in December 2006 that he owned 376,492 shares\ngiven to him by his father in 1992. (Ex. 2)\n5\nCanadian residency of two of his children and his ex-wife, his parents\u2019 and surviving\nsister\u2019s U.K. citizenship and residency, his past employment for the Canadian\ngovernment, and his stock ownership, reportedly since July 1989,  in the foreign\n5\ncompany co-founded by his father.\nAs of December 2006, Applicant owned 376,492 shares of stock in the U.K.\ncompany co-founded by his father. The shares had an approximate value of \u00a31,694,214\n($3,326,758.61 US). He was paid stock dividends totaling $53,228.13 in 2006, which\nwere deposited directly into a savings account in the U.K. Funds were transferred by\nhim into a linked checking account maintained for travel expenses during his annual\nvisits to the U.K. to see his parents. As of December 2006, Applicant had $98,529.34\n(U.S.) on deposit in a U.K. bank. Applicant also had $9,588.61 on deposit in an account\nin a Canadian financial institution out of which he paid monthly child support of $1,350\n(Can.). (Ex. 2)\nOn December 14, 2006, Applicant acknowledged in response to DOHA\ninterrogatories that he still owned 376,492 shares of the U.K. company co-founded by\nhis father. His indicated his father was no longer a shareholder, but was employed as a\nconsultant by the company. Applicant denied any intent to renew his UK passport on its\nexpiration. (Ex. 2)\nIn April 2007, Applicant changed jobs and the pending request for a clearance for\nhim was transferred to his new employer. A principal research scientist, Applicant has\nbeen working on unclassified projects focusing on the use of lasers to image\nunderwater objects (laser spectroscopy) and on radio and antenna work. (Tr. 77-78)\n \nAfter he received the SOR in March 2007, Applicant attempted to divest himself\nof his stocks in the U.K. company, which had 19,455,277 ordinary shares outstanding\nas of July 11, 2007 (Ex. B). Because of the number of shares held by Applicant, the\ncompany\u2019s board would not issue a resolution allowing him to sell without the required\nstock certificate. (Tr. 70) After the registrar confirmed that an original certificate had\nbeen issued in 1994 but sent to Applicant\u2019s old address, the company board allowed the\nsale to proceed. (Tr. 70-71) On October 29, 2007, Applicant sold his entire holdings\n(376,492 shares at a price of \u00a35.40 per share). After deducting fees associated with the\ntransaction (largely the broker\u2019s commission), \u00a32,025,940.10 was deposited into his\n\u201ccurrent account\u201d in the U.K. on November 12, 2007. (Ex. C, Ex. D) It was automatically\ntransferred into his linked savings account. On November 23, 2007, Applicant\ntransferred  \u00a32,034,061.90 ($4,172,783.80 U.S.) from his U.K. savings account to his\nbank in the U.S. (Ex. D, Ex. E, Tr. 56-57) As of December 4, 2007, he had closed both\nof his accounts in the U.K. bank. (Ex. D)\n\nHe turned the passport over to the vice president for administration (Ex. A), who apparently also serves as\n6\nthe company\u2019s facility security officer (Tr. 44).\n6\nApplicant is somewhat familiar with the operations and corporate management of\nthe U.K. company. He is aware that the company moved its U.S. manufacturing\noperations to another state (Tr. 78-79). He exchanges Christmas greetings with a\nmember of the company\u2019s board (one of the company\u2019s two executive officers), but has\nno regular contact with company management or employees other than his father. (Tr.\n86)\nApplicant continues to maintain a bank account in Canada from which he pays\nhis child support and gives his daughter a voluntary allowance of $1,000 (Can.) per\nmonth. She is a freshman at a college in Canada. (Tr. 35, 61-63) As of November 23,\n2007, he had $15,119.39 (Can.) on deposit in his account in Canada. (Ex. H) \nApplicant\u2019s spouse is a clinical psychologist licensed to practice in the U.S. (Tr.\n66) They own their home in the U.S. on which they have a mortgage. (Tr. 72-73) In\nsummer 2007, Applicant purchased outright another house for just over $600,000 in a\nlocale near work. Applicant and his spouse plan to sell their current residence and move\ninto the other home once renovations are completed. (Tr. 73-74) With the transfer of the\nstock proceeds to the U.S., Applicant has $820,000 in a high yield savings account in a\nlocal U.S. bank (Ex. J), and $3,300,000 in an investment account that is going to be set\nup into a trust for his autistic son. (Ex. I, Tr. 75) \nOn his receipt of the SOR in mid-March 2007, Applicant learned for the first time\nthat his possession of a valid U.K. passport could prevent him from obtaining the\nrequested clearance. (Tr. 42) On November 5, 2007, Applicant voluntarily surrendered\nhis U.K. passport to his employer\u2019s custody until it expires.  (Ex. A) He is willing to\n6\nrenounce his U.K. citizenship if necessary (\u201cif I had to, if I was asked to renounce my\ncitizenship, I would.\u201d Tr. 90. See also Tr. 82).\nApplicant\u2019s parents and sister continue to reside in their native U.K. His father\nholds the title of president of the company that he originally co-founded, which is now\nonly one part of a larger corporate organization. He has no managerial or executive\nresponsibilities, but serves as a part-time salaried consultant. In October 2005,\nApplicant\u2019s father was given a lifetime achievement award by the preeminent institute in\nhis field in the U.K. (Ex. 3, Tr. 84) Applicant\u2019s father was disappointed that Applicant had\ndivested himself of his holdings in the company but understood that a large foreign\ninterest was incompatible with a U.S. security clearance. (Tr. 67-68) To Applicant\u2019s\nunderstanding, the U.K. company\u2019s line of business is directed to products and service\nin the oil and pharmaceutical sectors and not governmental activities. (Tr. 78)\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\n\n7\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s overarching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \n\n8\nAnalysis\nGuideline C, Foreign Preference\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Foreign Preference is set out in\nAG & 9:\nWhen an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a\nforeign country over the United States, then he or she may be prone to\nprovide information or make decisions that are harmful to the United\nStates.\nA native of the U.K., Applicant came to the U.S. in 1997 from Canada for work\nand to be near his son, whom he moved to a residential facility in the U.S. After\nmarrying a native U.S. citizen in March 2000, Applicant decided to live here\npermanently, and in January 2005, he became a naturalized U.S. citizen. He took no\naction to renounce his British citizenship or relinquish the U.K. passport that he had\nrenewed shortly before his marriage. His retention of a valid foreign passport is an\nexercise of a privilege of his U.K. citizenship after becoming a U.S. citizen, raising\nconcerns of foreign preference under \u00b6 10(a)(1) (exercise of any right, privilege or\nobligation of foreign citizenship after becoming a U.S. citizen or through the foreign\ncitizenship of a family member. This includes but is not limited to: (1) possession of a\ncurrent foreign passport). Although Applicant traveled abroad exclusively on his U.S.\npassport after he became a U.S. citizen, he was free to travel as a U.K. citizen and to\npresent that document as proof of his U.K. citizenship for other benefits or privileges if\nhe so chose. The mitigating condition available where dual citizenship is based on birth\nin a foreign country (see \u00b6 11(a)), does not adequately address the security risks (e.g.,\nunverifiable travel) associated with a foreign passport.\nApplicant submits in mitigation that he turned over his U.K. passport to his\nemployer\u2019s custody on November 5, 2007. His good-faith effort to comply with DoD\nrequirements satisfies mitigating condition \u00b6 11(e) (the passport has been destroyed,\nsurrendered to the cognizant security authority, or otherwise invalidated). Applicant\npresumably could reapply for a U.K. passport. There is no indication that he has notified\nthe U.K. authorities of the custody transfer. Given his considerable ties to the U.S.\n(marriage to U.S. citizen, home ownership, employment, son\u2019s residential placement in\nthe U.S.), and his recent divestiture of stock ownership in the U.K. company, Applicant\nis not likely to do so. He expressed a credible intent to renounce his U.K. citizenship if\nasked to do so. Willingness to renounce dual citizenship is itself potentially mitigating\nunder \u00b611(b) (the individual has expressed a willingness to renounce dual citizenship).\nWhile he has taken no action in this regard, he demonstrated a preference for the U.S.\nby traveling on his U.S. passport, even to the U.K., when he could have used his valid\nU.K. passport.\n\nUnder AG \u00b6 7(a) contact with a foreign family member can be disqualifying if that contact creates a\n7\nheightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion. The government\nalleged only foreign financial ties under Guideline B. It is seemingly inconsistent to allege that Applicant is at\nheightened risk because of his substantial interest in the foreign-owned or foreign-operated business and not\nallege that Applicant is at a heightened risk because of his relationship to his father, who co-founded and still\nconsults for the business.\n9\nGuideline B, Foreign Influence\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Foreign Influence is set out in\nAG & 6:\nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual\nhas divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or\ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a\nway that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by\nany foreign interest. Adjudication under this Guideline can and should\nconsider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or\nfinancial interest is located, including, but not limited to, such\nconsiderations as whether the foreign country is known to target United\nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a\nrisk of terrorism.\nApplicant has close bonds with family members (parents and sister) who are\nresident citizens of the U.K. He travels to the U.K. at least once a year to visit them.\nPerhaps because the U.S. and U.K. have long been allies, the Government did not\nallege that these relationships create a heightened risk of foreign exploitation,\ninducement, manipulation, pressure or coercion, despite his father\u2019s role in the\nfounding, operation, and ongoing consulting in a U.K. business in which Applicant held a\npotentially disqualifying financial interest.7\nAs recently as late October 2007, Applicant held 376,492 shares of ordinary\nstock in a U.K. company that had been started by his father. The shares had a value of\nabout $3,326,758.61 (US). Applicant also had $98,529.34 (US) on deposit in a bank in\nthe U.K. Disqualifying condition \u00b6 7(e) (a substantial business, financial, or property\ninterest in a foreign country, or in any foreign-owned or foreign-operated business,\nwhich could subject the individual to heightened risk of foreign influence or exploitation)\nis clearly implicated. Applicant has a heavy burden of mitigation, and not only because\nof the high dollar value of the foreign assets. With his father having staked his\nreputation and invested the last 36 years of his career on the U.K. corporation,\nconsiderations of family pride, affection and obligation for his parents, and the impact of\nthe U.K. business on his relatives, also come into play in assessing the risk of undue\nforeign influence because of Applicant\u2019s financial interest in the company.\nApplicant has alleviated the vulnerability concerns raised by his foreign financial\ninterests by divesting himself of his entire holdings in the U.K. company, transferring the\n\n10\nproceeds from the stock sale to the U.S., closing his savings and checking accounts in\nthe U.K., and bringing those liquid assets as well to the U.S. On being apprised in the\nSOR of the foreign influence risks associated with his foreign financial assets, Applicant\nput his career in the U.S. first, even though it came at some personal cost in that his\nfather was disappointed. The delay in selling the stock was not due to any reluctance on\nApplicant\u2019s part, but rather because he did not have the required certificate.\nThe close personal bonds Applicant retains with his parents and sister in the U.K.\nare not likely to place him in a position of having to choose between them and the\ninterests of the U.S. (See mitigating factor \u00b6 8(a) (the nature of the relationships with\nforeign persons, the country in which these persons are located, or the positions or\nactivities of those persons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be\nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual,\ngroup, organization, or government and the interests of the U.S.)). Historically close\nallies, the U.S. and U.K. do not have inimical interests. Political, economic, and social\ndifferences have been met with mutual respect. While his father continues to consult for\nthe U.K. company, Applicant testified with no rebuttal from the Government, that his\nduties for the defense contractor are unrelated to the business of the U.K. company.\nThe evidence shows that Applicant also has close ties of affection as well as\nobligation to his children, two of whom are residents of Canada and dual citizens of the\nU.K. and Canada. He maintains a bank account in Canada to pay child support and\ngives his college student daughter a monthly allowance. He has made an effort to\nmaintain his paternal relationship, traveling to Canada to visit them about once a month.\nThe Government did not allege any foreign influence concerns because of his children\u2019s\nforeign residency and citizenship or his financial interest in Canada. While these ties\nwere discussed at the hearing, nothing surfaced to warrant security concern. He no\nlonger has any financial interest in the U.K., and total funds on deposit in his Canadian\nbank account ($15,119.39 Can.) are so minimal in comparison with his U.S. assets to\npresent no conflict. Mitigating condition \u00b6 8(f) (the value or routine nature of the foreign\nbusiness, financial, or property interests is such that they are unlikely to result in a\nconflict and could not be used effectively to influence, manipulate, or pressure the\nindividual), applies.\nGuideline L, Outside Activities\nThe security concern related to the guideline for Outside Activities is set out in\nAG \u00b6 36:\n \nInvolvement in certain types of outside employment or activities is of\nsecurity concern if it poses a conflict of interest with an individual\u2019s\nsecurity responsibilities and could create an increased risk of unauthorized\ndisclosure of classified information.\nGuideline L applies when an applicant is engaged in employment or activities,\nincluding service, compensated or volunteer, with a foreign government, foreign\n\n11\nnational, foreign organization or other entity, representative of a foreign interest, or any\nforeign, domestic, or international organization or person engaged in the analysis,\ndiscussion, or publication of material on intelligence, defense, foreign affairs, or\nprotected technology. (AG \u00b6 37(a)) It also applies where an applicant has not reported\nor fully disclosed an outside activity when required to do so. (AG \u00b6 37(b)). Applicant\u2019s\nemployment with the Canadian government from 1992 to 1995, and his consulting\nduties with the U.K. measurement instrument company in 1994/95, predate his U.S.\ndefense contractor employment and were not alleged.\nThe Government\u2019s case under Guideline L focused on Applicant\u2019s stock\nownership in the U.K. company (SOR \u00b6 3.a) and on his father\u2019s role as cofounder and\ncurrent consultant for the foreign company (SOR \u00b6 3.b). While his father\u2019s duties with a\nforeign business could present a risk of foreign influence, Guideline L focuses on\nemployment, service, or activities by an applicant that are outside of his or her defense\ncontractor duties and pose a conflict of interest with his or her security responsibilities.\nHis father\u2019s employment is not an outside activity engaged in by Applicant. To the extent\nthat stock ownership in a foreign company can be considered an outside activity within\nthe scope of \u00b6 37(a) (any employment or service, whether compensated or volunteer,\nwith: (2) any foreign national, organization, or other entity), Applicant exercised\nshareholder rights by proxy through his father. However, those concerns have been\nmitigated since he no longer owns the stock (see \u00b6 38(b) (the individual terminated the\nemployment or discontinued the activity upon being notified that it was in conflict with\nhis or her security responsibilities)).\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation\nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent\nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole person concept. \nWhile alleged under three separate guidelines, the security concerns all relate to\nApplicant\u2019s ownership of stock in the U.K. company co-founded by his father. Applicant\nmaintained the U.K. bank account alleged in SOR \u00b6 2.b for convenience in receiving\ntwice yearly stock dividends, which were quite substantial. Yet except for some\nconsulting duties in 1994/95 and exercising shareholder voting rights by proxy,\nApplicant was not actively involved in the foreign corporation. Allocated a share of the\n\n12\ncompany by his father when he was a child, Applicant elected to pursue his own life and\ncareer. The opportunity to pursue his academic interests in astrophysics led Applicant to\nleave his native U.K. for Canada in 1992. On his divorce, he was granted sole custody\nof his oldest child, and they moved to the U.S. because of a favorable residential\nplacement for his son in 1997. Applicant has since established significant ties to the\nU.S. that led him to acquire U.S. citizenship in January 2005, to travel as a U.S. citizen\nin preference to his U.K. citizenship, and to act in furtherance of his career in the U.S. in\npreference to his family\u2019s interests in the U.K. by selling all his stock in the foreign\ncompany. With his spouse licensed to practice in the U.S., and his son continuing to\nrequire special services that are best provided in the U.S., Applicant is not likely to do\nanything to jeopardize his life and career in the U.S. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the\namended SOR, as required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline C:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline B:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 3, Guideline L:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 3.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 3.b:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.\n________________________\nELIZABETH M. MATCHINSKI\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Applicant requested a hearing.  On January 29, 2008, after the hearing, Administrative\nJudge Mark W. Harvey denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.   Applicant timely\n1\nappealed pursuant to the Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge erred by not giving\nApplicant 15 days notice of the hearing.  Finding error, we remand the case to the Judge for a new\nhearing in accordance with the Directive.\nThe Judge received Applicant\u2019s case on January 17, 2008.  A long series of e-mail messages\nensued between the Judge, Department Counsel, and Applicant.  The Judge initially suggested\nJanuary 24.  When that date was not acceptable to Department Counsel, the Judge and Department\nCounsel continued to consider other dates.  Applicant asked for time to consider the effect of the\nprior hearing and use of the transcript from the prior hearing.  (See footnote 1.)  On January 22, the\nJudge stated that he was scheduling the hearing for January 29, although it could be canceled if not\nneeded.  On January 28, Applicant left a voice-mail message for the Judge saying that he could not\nattend the hearing on January 29 because he had significant training that day.  The Judge sent out an\ne-mail to the effect that Applicant could either fail to attend the hearing on January 29, in which case\nApplicant would lose his clearance by default, or he could choose a date during the week of February\n11-15.  Applicant indicated that he had further training the week of February 11.  Applicant attended\nthe hearing on January 29.  \nAt the hearing on January 29, Applicant stated that he was not prepared for the hearing.  The\nJudge offered to postpone the hearing until later in the day to allow Applicant time to review the\nrecord.  Applicant declined the offer.  The Judge also stated that he would suspend the hearing at any\ntime if Applicant wanted to take time to study the record.  Applicant did not request such a\nsuspension.\nThe Directive requires that an applicant be given 15 days notice of a hearing in order to\nproperly prepare for it.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.8.  The Board has acknowledged that applicants can waive\nthat notice under appropriate circumstances.  Those circumstances generally require a discussion of\nthe notice provision at the hearing with a clear statement by Applicant that he is making a knowing\nand intelligent waiver the 15-day notice requirement.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 05-12037 at 2-3\n(App. Bd. May 10, 2007).\n\n3\nThe on-the-record discussion of waiver in the previously cited case is very different from the\nrecord in the case before us.  In this case, the Judge states the following in his decision:  \u201cWhen the\nhearing began, Applicant cited his desire to attend training that day, and objected to the hearing being\nheld that day.  At the start of the hearing, he also indicated he did not believe he was prepared for\nthe hearing.\u201d  Decision at 2.  The Judge then states his offer to delay the start of the hearing for\nperhaps three hours or to suspend the proceedings at any time to give Applicant a chance to review\nthe record.  Id.  The Judge says that \u201c[d]uring his opening statement, Applicant expressed his\nappreciation for the early start on the proceeding [7:30 am], and never expressed a clear objection\nto going forward with the hearing without delaying it.\u201d  Decision at 2-3.  The Judge then quotes an\nexchange between the Judge and Applicant near the end of the hearing in which Applicant says he\ndidn\u2019t want to miss his training and didn\u2019t want to \u201ckeep dragging it out\u201d and delay the Judge.\nDecision at 3.  Nowhere in the record does Applicant state a knowing and intelligent waiver of the\n15-day notice provision of the Directive \u00b6 E3.1.8.  This is true notwithstanding a statement on page\nten of the transcript where Department Counsel noted her impression that Applicant \u201cwas willing\nto waive his 15-day notice to allow the hearing to be held today rather than in mid-February.\u201d  The\nspecific reference to the 15-day requirement was never commented on by the Judge, nor was\nApplicant asked about it at any time.  Given the absence of a discussion on the record between the\nJudge and the parties on this issue, the Board cannot determine with certainty that Applicant clearly\nunderstood his rights under the Directive and knowingly waived them.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 04-\n12732 at 8 (App. Bd. Nov. 2, 2006).\nIn the absence of such a waiver, the Board remands the case to the Judge with instructions\nthat the case be reopened and that Applicant be given an opportunity to have a new hearing with\nproper notice.\nOrder\nThe decision of the Judge denying Applicant a security clearance is REMANDED.  \nSigned: Michael Y.

On November 7, 2007, Judge Christopher Graham held a hearing. \nJudge Graham left federal service prior to issuing his decision. On January 24, 2008, \nthe case was assigned to me.

The transcript was completed on February 6, \n2008.  \n \nProcedural Issues \n \nApplicant objected to holding the second hearing and asked that the decision be \nbased solely on the previous hearing. Department Counsel cited the importance of \nassessing credibility and requested a hearing (R2. 77). I granted Department Counsel\u2019s \nmotion for a hearing. \n \nApplicant objected to the hearing because he did not want to miss training. In an \ne-mail,4 I offered to contact the person conducting Applicant\u2019s training. I wanted to \nexplain why the hearing was necessary and to seek his excusal from training. Applicant \ntelephoned me and requested that the hearing proceed on January 29, 2008. The \nhearing was set for 7:30 a.m. on January 29, 2008, to accommodate Applicant\u2019s desire \nto avoid missing training (R2. 22).5 When the hearing began, Applicant cited his desire \nto attend training that day, and objected to the hearing being held that day (R2. 8-14). At \nthe start of the hearing, he also indicated he did not believe he was prepared for the \nhearing (R2. 10). I offered to delay the hearing, however, Applicant said he wanted to \nhold the hearing that day (R2. 8-15). Department Counsel explained that Applicant had \nnot received the 15-day notice to which he was entitled, and I offered to suspend the \nhearing at any time, if Applicant needed time to review documents or the transcript (R2. \n13-14). During his opening statement, Applicant expressed his appreciation for the early \n \n3On Aug. 30, 2006, the Under Secretary of Defense (Intelligence) published a memorandum \ndirecting application of revised Adjudicative Guideline to all adjudications and other determinations made \nunder the Directive and Department of Defense (DoD) Regulation 5200.2-R, Personnel Security Program \n(Regulation), dated Jan. 1987, as amended, in which the SOR was issued on or after Sep. 1, 2006. The \nrevised Adjudicative Guidelines are applicable to Applicant\u2019s case. \n \n4 I sustained Applicant\u2019s objection to admission of e-mails discussing setting the hearing date (R. \n9). However, I explained to Applicant that those e-mails are available should the Appeal Board wish to \nhave them attached to the record (R. 9).   \n \n5 The citations to the record for the first hearing do not contain any subscript numbers.  The \ncitations to the second hearing have a subscript \u201c2,\u201d for example: R2. 5 refers to page 5 of the second \nhearing. \n \n\n \n3 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                           \nstart on the proceeding, and never expressed a clear objection to going forward with the \nhearing without delaying it (R2. 22).  Towards the end of the second hearing Applicant \nand I engaged in the following colloquy: \n \nApplicant: Yes. And I wasn\u2019t trying to get out of the hearing at all, but the \ntraining session was very important to me and I didn\u2019t want to keep \ndragging it out. You know, so I decided well you know what, if I can just go \ntoday and just get it over with I don\u2019t want to keep having to delay you. \n \nAJ: I was a little surprised when you said, \u201cNo, let\u2019s have it tomorrow.\u201d \n \nApplicant:  Well, you know, I don\u2019t like to go a whole lot of back and forth a \nlot of times. I like to get things done.  .  .  . And that\u2019s what I\u2019m about, just \ngetting things done. And I did, it did. I might have taken a little time \nthinking about what I want to do, but I did want to have the opportunity to \ncome out here and meet you and you to see me, face to face and get to \nsee who I am as a person, as an individual.  .  .  . \n \n(R2. 74-75). \n \nThe hearing on January 29, 2008, did not reveal any new, material facts. \nEssentially, the second hearing was consistent with the first hearing. At the second \nhearing, in a few instances, he remembered some facts which bolstered his credibility, \nor he clearly denied culpability for some offenses. To ensure Applicant was not \nprejudiced by holding the hearing on January 29, 2008, I will not consider the hearing \non January 29, 2008, except where he provided facts that tended to support approval of \nhis security clearance. No adverse facts will be considered against Applicant based on \nthe hearing on January 29, 2008.   \n \nIn regard to Department Counsel\u2019s submitted exhibits, Applicant objected to \nconsideration of charges and events from 1990 and 1994 because they are not relevant \nbeing remote in time from the hearing (R. 26). Although these offenses have limited \nrelevance as individual offenses, they cannot be considered piecemeal or in isolation. \nThey must be considered under the whole person concept and especially in the context \nof whether Applicant truthfully disclosed adverse information on his SF 86. Applicant\u2019s \nobjection is overruled.  See also Judge Graham\u2019s ruling at R. 27-28.    \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nAs to the SOR\u2019s factual allegations, Applicant made a few admissions in his \nresponses to interrogatories and at his hearings. His admissions are incorporated \nherein as findings of fact. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence of \nrecord, I make the following findings of fact.   \n \n \nApplicant is a 34-year-old senior communications systems engineer (R. 31, 35). \nHe is single, and has a seven year old son (R. 32).  His son lives in a different state with \n\n \n4 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                           \nhis mother (R. 32).  Applicant and the mother of his son have joint custody, however, his \nson\u2019s mother is the primary custodian (R. 32-33). In 1997, he received a bachelor of arts \ndegree in communications (R. 35, 56). He does not have any military service (R. 35).    \n \n \nOn December 26, 1990, Applicant was arrested and charged with Criminal \nMischief, 4th Degree (R. 55). There was an altercation between several men (R. 36-38). \nSome white men were yelling racial slurs at Applicant and his friends (R. 38, 57, 59). \nApplicant avoided being seriously injured when someone swung a pipe at him and \nmissed (R. 37, 58). Applicant threw a log through the window of the residence where \nthe white men lived (R. 37, 38, 58, 61). Applicant said he took responsibility for his \nactions, but could not remember whether he pleaded guilty (R. 68-70). He paid \nrestitution for the damaged window, paid a fine and completed some community service \n(R. 37-38, 65, 70).  SOR \u00b6 1.a.  See also R2. 27-31. \n \nOn July 10, 1993, Applicant was arrested and charged with (1) Disorderly \nConduct/Intoxicated and Disruptive Behavior and (2) Simple Assault on a Police \nOfficer/Government Official (R. 70-71).  He could not remember whether he went to the \npolice station and could not remember whether he was intoxicated (R. 75). Count (1) \nwas dismissed and he was found Not Guilty of Count (2) because the officer did not \nshow up for court (R. 39, 71, 76).  Applicant said he could not remember anything about \nthe events leading to the arrest (R. 73). At his second hearing, he disclosed the arrest \nwas made to make an example of him and was without good cause.  He did not assault \na government official (R2. 31). He did remember his hearing in court and the dismissal \nof the charge (R. 76-77, 79). SOR \u00b6 1.b.  See also R2. 31-37. \n \nOn March 10, 1994, Applicant was arrested and charged with (1) manufacturing \nmarijuana; (2) marijuana possession with intent to sell or distribute; and (3) maintaining \na vehicle or dwelling place containing a controlled substance (R. 79-80; GE 6 at 2). \nApplicant was waiting for a package from his parents (R. 82). A package arrived, but it \nmay have been for Applicant\u2019s roommate (R. 83). It was definitely not Applicant\u2019s \npackage (R. 83). There was marijuana in the package, and Applicant was unpleasantly \nsurprised (R. 85). The apartment was in Applicant\u2019s name, and the police arrested \nApplicant (R. 84-85). He said he was a victim of circumstances and was worried \n\u201cbecause at that time, and even the government stated that they were falsifying \nfictitiously after certain individuals. You know, young black males, at the time, and \nbasically it was a situation where I was, had bad associations\u201d (R. 90-91). The police \nreport indicated 1000 grams of marijuana was seized from a U.S. mail package after a \nK-9 alert (GE 11). Applicant denied that it was his marijuana (R2. 43). He pleaded guilty \nand was found guilty of counts (2) and (3), both felonies (R. 39-40, 88-90; GE 6 at 2). \nThe court sentenced him to four years in jail (three years suspended), to pay a fine and \ncourt costs totaling about $450, to complete 50 hours of community service, to be \nevaluated for substance abuse, and to serve five years of probation (R. 40, 95). He said \nhe did not serve any time in jail (R. 41, 91-92). He successfully completed probation and \nhis community service requirement (R. 40, 96). His drug tests did not have any adverse \nresults (R. 94-95). SOR \u00b6 1.c.

He \nwas alone, as he drove his sister\u2019s vehicle (R. 119). Applicant had just dropped off \nsome friends (R2. 48-49). The police stopped the car Applicant was driving and found a \nfirearm in the car (R. 111). He believed the firearm was found under the backseat (R2. \n48). It was not his firearm (R. 119). He was not aware the firearm was in the car when \nhe was pulled over by the police (R2. 45-46). He did not remember the other details of \nthe incident (R. 112-118). He was held in a cell overnight (R. 123). He pleaded guilty \nand the court found him guilty of count (1), and sentenced him to three weeks of house \narrest (via ankle bracelet), to pay a $90 fine, and to complete 10 days of community \nservice (R. 41, 125).  SOR \u00b6 1.d. See also R2. 44-49. \n \nOn January 26, 1999, Applicant was arrested and charged with possession of \nmarijuana of an amount greater than one half ounce and less than one and one half \nounces (R. 127).  The charge was dismissed.  Applicant said the police found the \nmarijuana at issue on the side of the road in front of his residence (R. 42, 128-133). At \nthe second hearing, he indicated he was sure the marijuana was not found on his \nperson, but was unsure about precisely where the marijuana was found (R2. 51-52). \nSOR \u00b6 1.e. See also R2. 49-53. \n \nOn August 25, 2002, Applicant was arrested and charged with (1) operating a \nmotor vehicle while intoxicated and (2) leaving the scene of an accident (R. 42). He hit a \nparked car, and his own car was totaled (R. 134). He could not remember leaving the \nscene of the accident (R. 135). The arrest report indicates he was stopped by the \npolice, who noted serious damage to his vehicle (GE 8). The police officer noted the \nsmell of alcohol on his breath, and administered a field sobriety test, which he failed.  \nHe was then arrested. Applicant said he remained at the scene of the accident (R2. 57), \nand he attributed his failure to pass the field sobriety test to the effects of an allergy \nmedicine he was taking (R2. 54-55). He agreed the police attempted to give him a \nbreathalyzer test, but did not explain why they were unable to complete the test (R2. 58). \nThe court found him guilty of count (1) and sentenced him to pay a $300 fine with a $50 \nsurcharge (R. 138-139).  His driver\u2019s license was suspended for 90 days.  SOR \u00b6 1.f. \nSee also R2. 53-59. \n \nIn August and September 2004, a court issued two restraining orders against \nApplicant at the request of Applicant\u2019s former girlfriend (R. 140).

In \nresponse to interrogatories he said, \u201cI did not know dismissals counted. [I d]id not \nremember. I was under the understanding that it was a booking (detainment) not an \narrest. I was never given my rights.\u201d (GE 3 at 2).  \n \nAt his hearing, he said he was not sure of the difference between being charged \nand a conviction (R. 43-44, 143-144).  He did not understand that he had to disclose \ninformation that did not result in a conviction (R. 143). He also said he disclosed the \nMarch 10, 1994, marijuana possession offense and indicated he received a fine and \nprobation in response to Section 21 of his SF 86 (R. 143).  At his second hearing, he \nindicated he did not know why he did not disclose the 1999 marijuana possession \ncharge (R2. 62). \n \nApplicant\u2019s response to Section 35 of his SF 86 was \u201cNO.\u201d SOR \u00b6 2.b alleged \nthat his automobile was voluntarily repossessed in 2002 because he did not make his \ncar payments. Applicant said his car was damaged in an accident, and he believed his \ninsurance company totaled the car (R. 17-20, 46, 144-145). In his response to \ninterrogatories, Applicant said he could not remember whether the car was repossessed \n(R. 145). His DoD interview states he told the investigator his car was repossessed in \nthe summer of 2002 because Applicant was unable to make the payments (R. 145).6 \nApplicant explained the DoD interview had some details that were incorrect (R. 147). \nJudge Graham asked Applicant to find out the status of the debt (R. 46-47, 55, 156).  \nAfter the hearing, Applicant provided a letter from his insurance company, dated \nNovember 25, 2002, indicating his car was in an accident (Ex.

However, he did not disclose the \nAugust and September 2004, restraining orders against Applicant (R. 145).7 SOR \u00b6 2.c.  \nHe said he did not disclose them because they were dismissed and he viewed them as \npart of the custody litigation that he disclosed previously on his SF 86 (R. 149). His third \nreason for not listing the restraining orders was because they were \u201calmost like criminal\u201d \nbecause it could \u201cturn criminal\u201d and it\u2019s a \u201cgrey area\u201d (R. 149-150).  At his second \nhearing he emphasized that the restraining orders were part of the custody litigation, \nwhich lasted from 2003 to 2005, and he did disclose the custody litigation (R2. 64-66).  \n \nSOR \u00b6 2.d alleges that on September 12, 2005, Applicant did not disclose \ninformation in two areas to an Office of Personnel Management (OPM) Investigator: (1) \nHis 1999 arrest and charge of marijuana possession of an amount greater than one half \nounce and less than one and one half ounces; and (2) In August and September 2004, \na court issued two restraining orders against Applicant. Applicant explained he did not \nrealize he had to report a dismissed charge (R. 47).  He said the OPM Investigator did \nnot ask about the restraining orders (R. 48). The OPM Investigator summarized the \ninterview (GE 2), but did not make a statement at Applicant\u2019s hearing. The interview \nsummary does not establish Applicant was asked to provide the omitted information.  \nSee also R2. 67-70. \n \n \nApplicant coached youth basketball in 1998 and 1999 (R. 150).  He assisted with \nbasketball camps, and boys club (R. 150). He is active in his church (R. 150).  He visits \nhis son and pays his child support (R. 153-154). He takes responsibility for his mistakes, \nand has earned the trust of his employer and the Department of Defense (R. 152).  A \nproject manager described his work as excellent and lauded his professionalism (Ex. \nB1). Two high-level company officials commended Applicant\u2019s tireless efforts to \naccomplish his mission as well as his excellent or terrific results (Ex. B2 and B3).  A \nfourth company official commended Applicant\u2019s diligence, persistence and outstanding \nproblem solving abilities (Ex. B4). Applicant works hard, helps others, pays his taxes, \nand is a good citizen (R. 152-153).  He is a responsible employee and considers himself \nto be \u201cAll-American\u201d (R. 156-157).  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \n \n7 In the restraining orders Applicant\u2019s spouse accused Applicant of multiple criminal offenses.  \nThere was no evidence to substantiate her allegations of criminal conduct. \n\n \n8 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n                                                          \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nIn the decision-making process, the Government has the initial burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR by \u201csubstantial evidence,\u201d8 \ndemonstrating, in accordance with the Directive, that it is not clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s access to classified information. \nOnce the Government has produced substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, \nthe burden shifts to Applicant to produce evidence \u201cto rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and [applicant] \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.15. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the \nGovernment. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).9 \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \n \n8 See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14. \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind \nmight accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the record.\u201d ISCR \nCase No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1). \u201cThis is something less \nthan the weight of the evidence, and the possibility of drawing two inconsistent conclusions from the \nevidence does not prevent [a Judge\u2019s] finding from being supported by substantial evidence.\u201d Consolo v. \nFederal Maritime Comm\u2019n, 383 U.S. 607, 620 (1966). \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but \nless than a preponderance.\u201d See v. Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. \n1994). \n \n9 \u201cThe Administrative Judge [considers] the record evidence as a whole, both favorable and \nunfavorable, evaluate[s] Applicant\u2019s past and current circumstances in light of pertinent provisions of the \nDirective, and decide[s] whether Applicant ha[s] met his burden of persuasion under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 04-10340 at 2 (App. Bd. July 6, 2006).  \n \n\n \n9 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                           \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), Section 3. \n \nAnalysis \n \n  \nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all \nappropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, including those described briefly \nabove, I conclude the following with respect to the allegations set forth in the SOR: \n \n \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct \n \nAG \u00b6 30 expresses the security concern pertaining to criminal conduct, \u201cCriminal \nactivity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. By its \nvery nature, it calls into question a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, \nrules and regulations.\u201d \n \nAG \u00b6 31 describes two conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying, \u00b6 31(a), \u201ca single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses,\u201d and \u00b6 31(c), \n\u201callegation or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was \nformally charged, formally prosecuted or convicted.\u201d  \n \nApplicant admitted in 1990 he threw a log through a window. The criminal \nconduct in SOR \u00b6 1.a is established.  \n \nApplicant denied the 1993 offense of disorder or intoxicated conduct and assault \non a police officer or government official.  The evidence did not establish the 1993 \noffense. The arrest did not result in a conviction. SOR \u00b6 1.b is not established. \n \nApplicant admitted and the records reflect he was charged with marijuana \npossession with intent to sell or distribute, and maintaining a vehicle or dwelling place \ncontaining a controlled substance in 1994. Both offenses are felonies. The marijuana \npossession involved approximately 1000 grams of marijuana. He pleaded guilty and \nwas found guilty of both counts. Although he denied culpability for these two offenses, \nand collateral estoppel applies. SOR \u00b6 1.c is established with respect to these two \noffenses.  \n \nIn ISCR Case No. 04-05712 at 7 (App. Bd. Oct. 31, 2006), the Appeal Board \nestablished a three-part test for determining when a guilty plea should not trigger \ncollateral estoppel: \n \nFirst, the party against whom the earlier decision is asserted must have \nbeen afforded a \u201cfull and fair opportunity\u201d to litigate that issue in the earlier \n\n \n10 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                           \ncase. Haring v. Prosise, 462 U.S. at 313; Allen v. McCurry, 449 U.S. 90, \n95 (1980). Second, the issues presented for collateral estoppel must \nbe the same as those resolved against the opposing party in the first trial. \nMontana v. United States, 440 U.S. 147, 155 (1979). Collateral estoppel \nextends only to questions \u201cdistinctly put in issue and directly determined\u201d \nin the criminal prosecution. Frank v. Mangum, 237 U.S. 309, 334 (1915). \nThird, the application of collateral estoppel in the second hearing must not \nresult in unfairness. Parklane Hosiery Co. v. Shore, 439 U.S. 322, 330 \n(1979)(detailing circumstances where allowing the use of collateral \nestoppel would result in unfairness); Montana v. United States, 440 U.S. \nat 155 (court should consider whether other special circumstances warrant \nan exception to the normal rules of preclusion). Federal courts decline to \napply collateral estoppel where the circumstances indicate a lack of \nincentive to litigate the original matter. \u201cPreclusion is sometimes unfair if \nthe party to be bound lacked an incentive to litigate the first trial, especially \nin comparison to the stakes of the second trial.\u201d Otherson v. U.S. Dept. of \nJustice, 711 F.2d at 273. The arguments for not giving preclusive effect to \nmisdemeanor convictions are that an individual may not have the incentive \nto fully litigate a misdemeanor offense because there is so much less at \nstake, or that plea bargains create an actual disincentive to litigate these \nparticular issues. See Otherson, 711 F.2d at 276. \n \nApplicant admitted in 1994 the police found a firearm in a vehicle he was driving. \nHe denied knowledge of the firearm, but pleaded guilty to illegal firearm possession. \nUnder New York Consolidated Law Service Penal \u00a7 265.01 this offense is a class A \nmisdemeanor with a maximum sentence to one year in jail. The fine contains a one-\npage arrest report, which lacks a description of the basis for the arrest (GE 7). Aside \nfrom Applicant\u2019s consistent denial of culpability, there is no evidence of record for \nbelieving Applicant knowingly possessed the firearm. Because of the lenient sentence \nhe received for pleading guilty and based primarily on unfairness, I conclude collateral \nestoppel does bar Applicant from challenging this misdemeanor conviction. I am not \nconvinced he knew the firearm was in the vehicle he was driving. I find the 1994 offense \nof firearm possession was not established. I find For Applicant in regard to SOR \u00b6 1.d.   \n \nApplicant denied the 1999 marijuana possession offense. The evidence does not \nestablish the 1999 marijuana possession. The arrest did not result in a conviction. \nApplicant refuted SOR \u00b6 1.e and I find For Applicant.  \n \nApplicant admitted in 2002 the police arrested him for DUI after he had an \naccident that totaled his vehicle. He subsequently was found guilty. He denied being \nintoxicated by alcohol, but contended his consumption of medicine impaired his driving.  \nI elect not to apply collateral estoppel and to permit Applicant to challenge this \nconviction. I conclude after carefully reviewing the police report of the incident, that he \nleft the scene of the accident, and was impaired by the alcohol consumption while \ndriving. He failed a field sobriety test, and did not fully cooperate in the breath alcohol \ntest (GE 8). I find the 2002 offense of DUI was established in regard to SOR \u00b6 1.f.   \n\n \n11 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n                                                          \n \nThe two 2004 restraining orders allege criminal misconduct, which Applicant \ndenied. There was no evidence aside from the allegations in the restraining order that \nApplicant committed the criminal conduct alleged in the restraining orders. Applicant\u2019s \nstatement is sufficient to refute the allegations of criminal conduct in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.g and \n1.h, and I find For Applicant. \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.i alleges that Applicant violated 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001 by falsifying his 2005 \nSF 86 and failing to disclose information to an OPM investigator. For a violation of 18 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 1001 to occur, the falsification must be material. The Supreme Court defined \n\u201cmateriality\u201d in United States v. Gaudin, 515 U.S. 506, 512 (1995): as a statement \nhaving a \u201cnatural tendency to influence, or [be] capable of influencing, the decision \nmaking body to which it is addressed.\u201d See also United States v. McLaughlin, 386 F.3d \n547, 553 (3d Cir. 2004).    \n \n  \nAs indicated in the discussion below, I found that Applicant falsely failed to \ndisclose information about his 1999 charge of marijuana possession in Section 24 of his \n2005 SF 86. I also concluded the other alleged falsifications were not established. If \nApplicant had provided an accurate answer on his 2005 SF 86 about the 1999 charge of \nmarijuana possession, his accurate answer would not be capable of influencing the \ngovernment to deny his security clearance. His 1999 marijuana possession charge is \nnot sufficiently important derogatory information.  The 1999 marijuana possession \ncharge occurred about five years before he signed his SF 86. The 1999 marijuana \npossession did not result in a conviction, and the underlying conduct was not \nestablished. It was not sufficiently serious10 to jeopardize approval of his security \nclearance. Making a false statement under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001 is a serious crime, a felony \n(the maximum potential sentence includes confinement for five years and a $10,000 \nfine). However, in this instance materiality and thus, making a false statement under 18 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 1001, are not established.  \n \n  \nIn sum, AG \u00b6\u00b6 31(a) and 31(c) apply with respect to some or all of the offenses in \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.c, and 1.f.   \n \nAG \u00b6 32 provides four conditions that could potentially mitigate security concerns: \n \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment; \n \n(b) the person was pressured or coerced into committing the act and those \npressures are no longer present in the person's life; \n \n(c) evidence that the person did not commit the offense; and, \n \n10 In Applicant\u2019s case, this includes aspects such as, the seriousness of the misconduct, and the \nnumber of violations of the law, regardless of whether the misconduct resulted in an arrest or conviction. \n\n \n12 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited \nto the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or \nrestitution, job training or higher education, good employment record, or \nconstructive community involvement. \n \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 32(a) \u2013 31(b) do not fully apply. Applicant\u2019s DUI occurred in 2002, which is \nsomewhat recent. There are three criminal offenses at issue in 1990, 1994 and 2002.  \nThey are not isolated. They cast doubt on Applicant\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness \nand good judgment. He was not pressured or coerced into committing the criminal \noffenses.  \n \nAG \u00b6 32(c) applies to some offenses but not to others. As indicated previously \nthe offenses in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.c, and 1.f are established and substantiated. The \noffenses in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.d through 1.i are refuted and not substantiated.   \n \nAG \u00b6 31(d) partially applies. There is some evidence of successful rehabilitation, \nincluding the passage of about 5 years since his DUI in 2002. Criminal activity has not \nrecurred. He expressed remorse concerning his youthful indiscretions, and he did \naccept responsibility for some of his misconduct. He has received some job training, \nand has an outstanding employment record. However, his post-offense behavior is \ninsufficient to fully mitigate the very serious misconduct in this case as described in \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.c, and 1.f. \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern pertaining to personal conduct: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \nAG \u00b6 16 describes two conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; and, \n \n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information concerning \nrelevant facts to an employer, investigator, security official, competent \nmedical authority, or other official government representative. \n\n \n13 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                           \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant deliberately provided false information or omitted \nrequired information on his 2005 SF 86 and to an OPM investigator in 2006.  Applicant\u2019s \nfalsification of Section 24 of his SF 86 is substantiated; however, the other three \nallegations of falsification are not substantiated. \n \nFor Section 24 of his SF 86, he responded, \u201cYES\u201d and listed his DUI arrest in \nAugust 2002. However, he did not disclose his 1999 marijuana possession charge. In \nresponse to interrogatories he said, \u201cI did not know dismissals counted. [I d]id not \nremember. I was under the understanding that it was a booking (detainment) not an \narrest. I was never given my rights.\u201d (GE 3 at 2). At his hearing, he said he was not sure \nof the difference between being charged and a conviction (R. 43-44, 143-144). He did \nnot understand that he had to disclose information that did not result in a conviction (R. \n143). He also said he disclosed the March 10, 1994, marijuana possession offense and \nindicated he received a fine and probation in response to Section 21 of his SF 86 (R. \n143). These explanations for not disclosing his 1999 marijuana possession charge are \nnot credible. He has misdemeanor involvement with law enforcement and the courts in \n1990 and 1993, and a felony conviction in 1994, followed by misdemeanor convictions \nin 1994 and 2002. He impressed me as a very intelligent, knowledgeable Applicant. By \n2005, when he completed his SF 86, he was well aware of the significance of being \ncharged, and deliberately chose not to disclose the requested information about his \n1999 marijuana possession charge. The falsification of an SF 86 need not be a material \nfalsification to constitute a security concern. Here, the 1999 marijuana possession \ncharge was not material, but it is of sufficient importance to be a security concern. \n \nFor SOR \u00b6 2.b, Applicant\u2019s vehicle was totaled in an accident. His insurance \ncompany arranged for their salvage yard to pick up Applicant\u2019s vehicle. His vehicle was \nnot repossessed by the lien holder. A credit report\u2019s statement about a vehicle being \nrepossessed is outweighed by the letter from the insurance company about the salvage \nyard taking Applicant\u2019s vehicle. He did not fail to disclose repossession of his vehicle on \nhis SF 86.   \n \nFor SOR \u00b6 2.c, Applicant disclosed his 2003 family court litigation over custody of \nhis son. However, he did not disclose the August and September 2004, restraining \norders against Applicant in response to Section 40 of his SF 86. He said he did not \ndisclose them because they were dismissed and he viewed them as part of the custody \nlitigation that he disclosed previously on his SF 86. Because of the apparent linkage to \nthe custody issue, his disclosure was sufficient. \n \nSOR \u00b6 2.d alleges that on September 12, 2005, Applicant did not disclose \nsufficient information to an OPM Investigator about his 1999 arrest and charge of \nmarijuana possession of an amount greater than one half ounce and less than one and \none half ounces; and the two restraining orders against Applicant in 2004. Applicant \nexplained he did not realize he had to report a dismissed charge. He said the OPM \nInvestigator did not ask about the restraining orders. The OPM Investigator summarized \nthe interview, but the interview summary does not establish Applicant was asked to \nprovide the omitted information.   \n \n\n \n14 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n                                                          \nI find For Applicant under Guideline E for SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.b, 2.c, and 2.d.  However, I \nspecifically find that AG \u00b6 16 (a) applies with respect to SOR \u00b6 2.a.   \n \nAG \u00b6 17 provides seven conditions that could mitigate security concerns in this \ncase: \n \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was \ncaused or significantly contributed to by improper or inadequate advice of \nauthorized personnel or legal counsel advising or instructing the individual \nspecifically concerning the security clearance process. Upon being made \naware of the requirement to cooperate or provide the information, the \nindividual cooperated fully and truthfully. \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, \nor other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur; \n \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress;  \n \n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable \nreliability; and, \n \n(g) association with persons involved in criminal activity has ceased or \noccurs under circumstances that do not cast doubt upon the individual's \nreliability, trustworthiness, judgment, or willingness to comply with rules \nand regulations. \n  \nNone of the mitigating conditions in AG \u00b6 17 apply to SOR \u00b6 2.a. Applicant\u2019s \n2005 falsification of his SF 86, is sufficiently recent to remain a security concern.11 He \n \n11The conduct in SOR \u00b6 2.a cannot be considered piecemeal. The Judge is required to evaluate the \nrecord evidence as a whole and reach a reasonable conclusion as to the recency of an applicant\u2019s conduct. \nISCR Case No. 03-02374 at 4 (App. Bd. Jan. 26, 2006) (citing ISCR Case No. 02-22173 at 4 (App. Bd. May \n26, 2004)). When the 2005 falsification of his SF 86 is considered in connection with the criminal conduct in \n1990, 1994 and 2002, the personal conduct in SOR \u00b6 2.a cannot be mitigated under AG \u00b6 16(c). His 2005 \nfalsification of his SF 86 continues to cast doubt on Applicant\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment. \n \n\n \n15 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                           \ndid not promptly inform the government of the falsification. He continued to deny \nculpability for omitting the 1999 marijuana possession charge at his hearing in 2007. He \ndid not receive counseling designed to improve his conduct.  No one advised him to \nfalsify his SF 86. He admitted that he omitted the 1999 marijuana possession charge, \nand the falsification of his SF 86 is substantiated. His failure to admit responsibility for \nfalsifying his 2005 SF 86 weighs against convincing me that similar misbehavior is \nunlikely to recur. The falsification of his SF 86 casts doubt on his current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and good judgment. His current service to the contractor and the \nDepartment of Defense is an important positive step, but it is not enough to mitigate his \nconduct. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n Under the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness \nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation \nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent \nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.     \nEventually Applicant admitted to security officials that he failed to disclose his \n1999 marijuana possession charge on of his 2005 SF 86. His 1990, 1994, and 2002 \nmisconduct occurred so long ago that his criminal conduct would be mitigated (in \nFebruary 2008), but for the 2005 falsification of his SF 86. He provided some evidence \nof remorse, or regret concerning his misconduct when he repeatedly stated he wanted \nto put his misconduct behind him. He recognized the damage his misconduct caused. \nHis record of good employment weighs in his favor. These factors show some \nresponsibility, rehabilitation, and mitigation. \n \n  \nThe evidence against mitigating Applicant\u2019s conduct is more substantial. His  \nfalsification of his 2005 SF 86 and his 1990, 1994, and 2002 misconduct were \nknowledgeable and voluntary. His misconduct is not isolated. He did not accept full \nresponsibility for failing to disclose the 1999 marijuana possession charge on his 2005 \nSF 86, instead contending at his 2007 hearing that he did not understand what a charge \nwas. He had ample experience in the criminal justice system, and is an intelligent man \nwith a bachelor\u2019s degree. He knew that he was charged in 1999 with marijuana \npossession, and he deliberately chose not to disclose the information on his 2005 SF \n86. He was sufficiently mature to be fully responsible for his conduct. Criminal \nmisbehavior is not prudent or responsible. His falsification of his 2005 SF 86 is \nparticularly aggravating, and weighs heavily against granting or continuing his security \n\n \n16 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n                                                          \nclearance. He did not receive counseling or therapy, and may not have a clear \nunderstanding about how to avoid future problematic situations. I have persistent and \nserious doubts about his judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness.  \n \n  \nHis misconduct calls into question his current ability or willingness to comply with \nlaws, rules and regulations. After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, \nand all the facts and circumstances, in the context of the whole person, I conclude he \nhas not mitigated the security concerns pertaining to criminal conduct and personal \nconduct.    \n \nI take this position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518 (1988), my \u201ccareful consideration of the whole person factors\u201d12 and \nsupporting evidence, my application of the pertinent factors under the Adjudicative \nProcess, and my interpretation of my  responsibilities under the Guidelines. Applicant \nhas not mitigated or overcome the government\u2019s case. For the reasons stated, I \nconclude he is not eligible for access to classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline J:   \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.d to 1.e: \n For Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.f:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.g to 1.i:  \n For Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:    \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 2.b to 2.d: \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue eligibility for a security \nclearance for Applicant.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact As to the SOR\u2019s factual allegations, Applicant made a few admissions in his responses to interrogatories and at his hearings. His admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. At Applicant\u2019s hearing, he reviewed the Findings of Fact in my decision of February 21, 2008, and described several corrections (Tr. 57-60, 75-88, GE 12). He also urged approval of a Secret clearance or provisional clearance, as opposed to a Top Secret clearance because it would be sufficient to perform his job (Tr. 23-24). The specific corrections to the record are listed below. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence of record, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant is a 34-year-old senior communications systems engineer (R. 31, 35, Tr. 5). He is single, and has a seven year old son (R. 32). His son lives in a different state with his mother (R. 32). Applicant and the mother of his son have joint custody, however, his son\u2019s mother is the primary custodian (R. 32-33). In 1997, he received a bachelor of arts degree in communications (R. 35, 56, Tr. 5). He does not have any military service (R. 35). Applicant does not currently hold a security clearance because his clearance was suspended as part of this process (Tr. 5). On December 26, 1990, Applicant was arrested and charged with Criminal Mischief, 4th Degree (R. 55). There was an altercation between several men (R. 36-38). Some white men were yelling racial slurs at Applicant and his friends (R. 38, 57",

He deliberately failed to disclose derogatory \ninformation on his 2005 security clearance application. Clearance is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn March 31, 2005, Applicant submitted a Security Clearance Application (SF \n86).1 On July 28, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) to him,2 pursuant to Executive Order 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information Within Industry, dated February 20, 1960, as \namended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive), dated January 2, \n \n1Government Exhibit (GE) 1. There is an allegation of falsification of the 2005 SF 86.   \n \n2Ex I (Statement of Reasons (SOR), dated Mar. 31, 2005). Exhibit I is the source for the facts in \nthe remainder of this paragraph unless stated otherwise. \nAugust 29, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n revoked. \n                                                          \n1992, as amended, modified and revised.3 The SOR alleges security concerns under \nGuidelines J (Criminal Conduct) and E (Personal Conduct). The SOR detailed reasons \nwhy DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance \nfor him, and recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a \nclearance should be granted, continued, denied, or\n \nApplicant responded to the SOR allegations, and elected to have his case \ndecided at a hearing. On November 7, 2007, another judge held a hearing. However, \nthat judge left federal service prior to issuing his decision. On January 24, 2008, the \ncase was assigned to me. Department Counsel requested a hearing and the second \nhearing was held on January 29, 2008. The transcript was completed on February 6, \n2008.  \n \nOn June 10, 2008, the Appeal Board remanded Applicant\u2019s case for a rehearing. \nISCR Case No. 06-24213 (App. Bd. June 10, 2008). The rationale for the Appeal \nBoard\u2019s remand is discussed beginning at page 3, infra.  \n \nOn July 31, 2008, Applicant\u2019s third hearing was held in Arlington, Virginia. On \nAugust 8, 2008, I received the transcript of Applicant\u2019s third hearing (Tr.). I approved a \ndelay until August 15, 2008, for Applicant to submit additional documentation (Tr. 25-26, \n88, 102). I subsequently approved additional delays until August 27, 2008, for Applicant \nto file additional matters (Tr. 103; AE C1-C7, C9, C11-C12, F1-F4).   \n \nProcedural Issues \n \nApplicant objected to holding the second hearing and asked that the decision be \nbased solely on the previous hearing. Department Counsel cited the importance of \nassessing credibility and requested a hearing (R2. 77). I granted Department Counsel\u2019s \nmotion for a hearing. \n \nApplicant objected to the hearing because he did not want to miss training. In an \ne-mail,4 I offered to contact the person conducting Applicant\u2019s training. I wanted to \nexplain why the hearing was necessary and to seek his excusal from training. Applicant \ntelephoned me and requested that the hearing proceed on January 29, 2008. I set the \nsecond hearing for 7:30 a.m. on January 29, 2008, to accommodate Applicant\u2019s desire \n \n3On Aug. 30, 2006, the Under Secretary of Defense (Intelligence) published a memorandum \ndirecting application of revised Adjudicative Guideline to all adjudications and other determinations made \nunder the Directive and Department of Defense (DoD) Regulation 5200.2-R, Personnel Security Program \n(Regulation), dated Jan. 1987, as amended, in which the SOR was issued on or after Sep. 1, 2006. The \nrevised Adjudicative Guidelines are applicable to Applicant\u2019s case. \n \n4 I sustained Applicant\u2019s objection to admission of e-mails discussing setting the hearing date (R. \n9). However, I explained to Applicant that those e-mails are available should the Appeal Board wish to \nhave them attached to the record (R2. 9).   \n \n\n \n3 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n                                                          \nto avoid missing training (R2. 22).5 When the hearing began, Applicant cited his desire \nto attend training that day, and objected to the hearing being held that day (R2. 8-14). At \nthe start of the hearing, he also indicated he did not believe he was prepared for the \nhearing (R2. 10). I offered to delay the hearing until the afternoon, however, Applicant \nsaid he wanted to hold the hearing that day (R2. 8-15). Department Counsel explained \nthat Applicant had not received the 15-day notice to which he was entitled, and I offered \nto suspend the hearing at any time, if Applicant needed time to review documents or the \ntranscript (R2. 13-14). During his opening statement, Applicant expressed his \nappreciation for the early start on the proceeding, and never expressed a clear objection \nto going forward with the hearing without delaying it (R2. 22). Towards the end of the \nsecond hearing Applicant and I engaged in the following colloquy: \n \nApplicant: Yes. And I wasn\u2019t trying to get out of the hearing at all, but the \ntraining session was very important to me and I didn\u2019t want to keep \ndragging it out. You know, so I decided well you know what, if I can just go \ntoday and just get it over with I don\u2019t want to keep having to delay you. \n \nAJ: I was a little surprised when you said, \u201cNo, let\u2019s have it tomorrow.\u201d \n \nApplicant:  Well, you know, I don\u2019t like to go a whole lot of back and forth a \nlot of times. I like to get things done.  .  .  . And that\u2019s what I\u2019m about, just \ngetting things done. And I did, it did. I might have taken a little time \nthinking about what I want to do, but I did want to have the opportunity to \ncome out here and meet you and you to see me, face to face and get to \nsee who I am as a person, as an individual.  .  .  . \n \n(R2. 74-75). \n \nAppeal Board Remand \n \n \nThe Appeal Board accurately described the processing of Applicant\u2019s case. ISCR \nCase No. 06-24213 at 2 (App. Bd. June 10, 2008). The Appeal Board made two \nadditional observations particularly worthy of note. First, it indicated: \n \nThe Directive requires that an applicant be given 15 days notice of a \nhearing in order to properly prepare for it. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.8.6 The Board \nhas acknowledged that [A]pplicant\u2019s can waive that notice under \nappropriate circumstances. Those statements generally require a \ndiscussion of the notice provision at the hearing with a clear statement by \n \n5 The citations to the record for the first hearing do not contain any subscript numbers.  The \ncitations to the second hearing have a subscript \u201c2,\u201d for example: R2. 5 refers to page 5 of the second \nhearing. \n \n6 Directive \u00b6 E3.1.8 provides, \u201cThe applicant shall have a reasonable amount of time to prepare \nhis or her case.  The applicant shall be notified at least 15 days in advance of the time and place of the \nhearing, which generally shall be held at a location in the United States within a metropolitan area near \nthe applicant's place of employment or residence.\u201d  \n\n \n4 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                           \nApplicant that he is making a knowing and intelligent waiver [of] the 15-\nday notice requirement. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 05-12037 at 2-3 (App. \nBd. May 10, 2007).  \n \nThe Appeal Board recognized that Applicant already had a hearing on November 7, \n2007. Id. at n. 1. The Appeal Board did not explain why Applicant still needed 15 days to \n\u201cproperly prepare\u201d for his second hearing. Moreover, the Appeal Board did not describe \nhow Applicant was prejudiced by lack of sufficient notice. Finally, neither of the two \ncases the Appeal Board cited to support the remand involved an Applicant who was \nreceiving their second hearing. In a case cited to support the remand decision, ISCR \nCase No. 05-12037 (App. Bd. May 10, 2007), the Appeal Board quoted the \nAdministrative Judge\u2019s colloquy with that Applicant, and then stated: \n \nAlthough pro se applicants cannot be expected to act like a lawyer, they \nare expected to take timely, reasonable steps to protect their rights under \nthe Directive. If they fail to take timely, reasonable steps to protect their \nrights, that failure to act does not constitute a denial of their rights. \nBecause Applicant did not object to proceeding or otherwise request a \ncontinuance of her case, she was not denied due process under the \nDirective or Executive Order. \n \nId. at 3 (internal citations omitted). In the other case the Appeal Board cited, the Appeal \nBoard\u2019s decision does not indicate whether that Applicant objected on appeal to lack of \nnotice. ISCR Case No. 04-12732 at 1 (App. Bd. Nov. 2, 2006).  The Appeal Board \nnotes: \n \nThe notice of hearing was issued on June 14, 2005 and the hearing was \nheld eight days later on June 22, 2005. Therefore, it appears the Applicant \ndid not receive the 15 days advanced notification mandated by Directive \u00b6 \nE3.1.8. An applicant may waive the 15 day notice requirement. However, \ngiven the absence of a discussion on the record between the \nAdministrative Judge and the parties on this issue, the Board cannot \ndetermine with certainty that he did. \n \nId. at 8.  I agree with the Appeal Board that it is prudent to obtain a waiver on the record \nwhen the 15-day notice requirement is not met. However, I respectfully suggest that \nasking an Applicant whether they are prepared to proceed, or offering a reasonable \ndelay upon request is adequate to protect an Applicant\u2019s right to due process. Of course \nwhen an Applicant specifically asks for 15 days of notice, that request should be \nhonored. An Applicant seeking a delay should be required to clearly object to \nproceeding or request a continuance on the record. Absent a clear and unambiguous \nobjection, waiver should be applied and a case should go forward to hearing. An \nApplicant can submit additional evidence after the hearing, if he or she chooses to do \nso.  \n \n\n \n5 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                           \nOther Procedural Issues \n \nIn regard to Department Counsel\u2019s submitted exhibits, Applicant objected to \nconsideration of charges and events from 1990 and 1994 because they are not relevant \nbecause of remoteness (R. 26; Tr. 17). Additionally, Applicant was a juvenile in 1990 \nwhen he was arrested and charged with criminal mischief in the 4th degree (Tr. 17). \nAlthough these offenses have less relevance because they are not recent, they cannot \nbe considered piecemeal or in isolation. GE 4 is relevant to establishing SOR \u00b6 1.a (Tr. \n17-18). All criminal offenses must be considered under the whole person concept and \nespecially in the context of whether Applicant truthfully disclosed adverse information on \nhis SF 86. Applicant\u2019s objection to GE 4 is overruled.  See also Judge\u2019s ruling from first \nhearing at R. 27-28. \n \nApplicant objected to consideration of his arrest record because the charges \nwere not relevant due to their dismissal, and did not constitute convictions (Tr. 14-16; \nGE 5). Applicant\u2019s objection to consideration of GE 5 was overruled because the arrest \nrecord is relevant to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.c, and 2.a (Tr. 16-17). Applicant did not have any \nadditional objections, and I admitted GEs 1-11 into evidence (Tr. 18). Department \nCounsel did not object to my consideration of Applicant\u2019s exhibits (AE) A and B, and I \nadmitted them into evidence (Tr. 20). Initially, Applicant requested and I agreed to \nconsider the transcript from the second hearing, but not from the first hearing (Tr. 28-31; \n44-45). Applicant subsequently withdrew his objection to consideration of the first \ntranscript, and I admitted it (Tr. 90-91).   \n \nDepartment Counsel objected to consideration of web pages that provided \ninformation about New York laws pertaining to driving under the influence of alcohol \n(DUI) or driving while intoxicated by alcohol (DWI) because they were not official \nsources of New York law (Ex. F2). I overruled the objection and admitted Ex. D and E. I \nalso admitted the statute Applicant allegedly violated (Ex. G).  \n \nDepartment Counsel objected (Ex. F2) to consideration of three letters or \nstatements from Applicant\u2019s sister (Ex. C14), a college instructor (Ex. C10), and a \ncollege assistant professor (Ex. C8).  The basis of Department Counsel\u2019s objection was \nthe failure to serve the government with the documents before or during the hearing or \nafter the hearing before my receipt of the documents (Ex. F2). Department Counsel did \nnot request to reopen the hearing to cross-examine Applicant concerning the exhibits. \nDepartment Counsel did not request a delay to question the persons providing the \ndocuments or to gather evidence to dispute the opinions of his sister and the college \ninstructors. The exhibits are admitted because they do not contradict the SOR \nallegations, and relate purely to Applicant\u2019s good character. Their admission does not \nprejudice the government and tends to ensure Applicant has received a full and fair \nhearing.    \n  \n\n \n6 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                           \nFindings of Fact \n \nAs to the SOR\u2019s factual allegations, Applicant made a few admissions in his \nresponses to interrogatories and at his hearings. His admissions are incorporated \nherein as findings of fact. At Applicant\u2019s hearing, he reviewed the Findings of Fact in my \ndecision of February 21, 2008, and described several corrections (Tr. 57-60, 75-88, GE \n12). He also urged approval of a Secret clearance or provisional clearance, as opposed \nto a Top Secret clearance because it would be sufficient to perform his job (Tr. 23-24). \nThe specific corrections to the record are listed below. After a complete and thorough \nreview of the evidence of record, I make the following findings of fact.   \n \n \nApplicant is a 34-year-old senior communications systems engineer (R. 31, 35, \nTr. 5). He is single, and has a seven year old son (R. 32). His son lives in a different \nstate with his mother (R. 32).  Applicant and the mother of his son have joint custody, \nhowever, his son\u2019s mother is the primary custodian (R. 32-33). In 1997, he received a \nbachelor of arts degree in communications (R. 35, 56, Tr. 5). He does not have any \nmilitary service (R. 35). Applicant does not currently hold a security clearance because \nhis clearance was suspended as part of this process (Tr. 5).   \n \n \nOn December 26, 1990, Applicant was arrested and charged with Criminal \nMischief, 4th Degree (R. 55). There was an altercation between several men (R. 36-38). \nSome white men were yelling racial slurs at Applicant and his friends (R. 38, 57, 59). \nApplicant avoided being seriously injured when someone swung a pipe at him and \nmissed (R. 37, 58). Applicant threw a log through the window of the residence where \nthe white men lived (R. 37, 38, 58, 61). Applicant said he took responsibility for his \nactions, but could not remember whether he pleaded guilty (R. 68-70). At his third \nhearing, he indicated he did in fact remember pleading guilty (Tr. 77). He did not have a \ncontested trial on any of his convictions (Tr. 78). He paid restitution for the damaged \nwindow, paid a fine and completed some community service (R. 37-38, 65, 70).  SOR \u00b6 \n1.a.  See also R2. 27-31, Tr. 52-54. \n \nOn July 10, 1993, Applicant was arrested and charged with (1) Disorderly \nConduct/Intoxicated and Disruptive Behavior and (2) Simple Assault on a Police \nOfficer/Government Official (R. 70-71). He could not remember whether he went to the \npolice station and could not remember whether he was intoxicated (R. 75). At his third \nhearing, he recalled that it was \u201cmore like a ticket or a fine\u201d (Tr. 80). He did not \nremember being photographed by the police or providing finger prints (Tr. 80-81). Count \n(1) was dismissed and he was found Not Guilty of Count (2) because the officer did not \nshow up for court (R. 39, 71, 76). Applicant said he could not remember anything about \nthe events leading to the arrest (R. 73). At his second hearing, he disclosed the arrest \nwas made to make an example of him and was without good cause.  He did not assault \na government official (R2. 31). He did remember his hearing in court and the dismissal \nof the charge (R. 76-77, 79). SOR \u00b6 1.b.

A package arrived, but it \nmay have been for Applicant\u2019s roommate (R. 83). It was definitely not Applicant\u2019s \npackage (R. 83). There was marijuana in the package, and Applicant was unpleasantly \nsurprised (R. 85). The apartment was in Applicant\u2019s name, and the police arrested \nApplicant (R. 84-85). He said he was a victim of circumstances and was worried \n\u201cbecause at that time, and even the government stated that they were falsifying \nfictitiously after certain individuals. You know, young black males, at the time, and \nbasically it was a situation where I was, had bad associations\u201d (R. 90-91). The police \nreport indicated 1000 grams of marijuana was seized from a U.S. mail package after a \nK-9 alert (GE 11). Applicant denied that it was his marijuana (Tr. 32-34; R2. 43). He \npleaded guilty and was found guilty of counts (2) and (3), both felonies (R. 39-40, 88-90; \nTr. 33; GE 6 at 2). The court sentenced him to four years in jail (three years \nsuspended), to pay a fine and court costs totaling about $450, to complete 50 hours of \ncommunity service, to be evaluated for substance abuse, and to serve five years of \nprobation (R. 40, 95). He said he did not serve any time in jail (R. 41, 91-92). He \nsuccessfully completed probation and his community service requirement (R. 40, 96). \nHis drug tests did not have any adverse results (R. 94-95). He said he accepted \nresponsibility for the offenses by pleading guilty (Tr. 36-38, 63). Eventually, he said he \ncommitted the offense (Tr. 41). However, he said his mistake was his choice of friends, \nand he did not know that drugs were in the package the police seized (Tr. 63). SOR \u00b6 \n1.c.

He \nwas alone, as he drove his sister\u2019s vehicle (R. 119). Applicant had just dropped off \nsome friends (R2. 48-49). The police stopped the car Applicant was driving and found a \nfirearm in the car (R. 111). He believed the firearm was found under the backseat (R2. \n48). It was not his firearm (R. 119). He was not aware the firearm was in the car when \nhe was pulled over by the police (R2. 45-46). He did not remember the other details of \nthe incident (R. 112-118). He was held in a cell overnight (R. 123). He pleaded guilty \nand the court found him guilty of count (1), and sentenced him to three weeks of house \narrest (via ankle bracelet), to pay a $90 fine, and to complete 10 days of community \nservice (R. 41, 125).  At the third hearing, he said he did not remember who owned the \nfirearm; however, he took full responsibility for this charge (Tr. 40). Ultimately, he said \nhe committed the offense (Tr. 41).

The charge was dismissed. Applicant said the police found the \nmarijuana at issue on the side of the road in front of his residence (R. 42, 128-133). At \nthe second hearing, he indicated he was sure the marijuana was not found on his \nperson, but was unsure about precisely where the marijuana was found (R2. 51-52).

G at 1). Driving while intoxicated violates New York (NY) CLS \nVehicle and Traffic Code (VTC) \u00a7 1192.3 (Ex. G at 1). He hit a parked car, and his own \ncar was seriously damage (R. 134; Ex. 8). He could not remember leaving the scene of \nthe accident (R. 135). The arrest report indicates he was stopped by the police, who \nnoted serious damage to his vehicle (GE 8). The police officer noted the smell of alcohol \non his breath, and administered a field sobriety test, which he failed. He was then \narrested. Applicant said he remained at the scene of the accident (R2. 57), and he \nattributed his failure to pass the field sobriety test to the effects of an allergy medicine \nhe was taking (R2. 54-55, Tr. 42). He denied that he was drinking alcohol at the time of \nthe accident (Ex. 2 at 4). At his third hearing, he indicated he did not leave the scene of \nthe accident (Tr. 83). He merely pulled over, and it was not miles from the scene of the \naccident (Tr. 83). He also said he pleaded guilty to driving under the influence of a \nprescription medication as opposed to driving under the influence of alcohol (Tr. 45-46). \nHe agreed the police attempted to give him a breathalyzer test, but did not explain why \nthey were unable to complete the test (R2. 58).7 The court found him guilty and \nsentenced him to pay a $300 fine with a $50 surcharge (R. 138-139; Ex. 2 at 4-5). His \ndriver\u2019s license was suspended for 90 days. The record does indicate whether he was \nfound guilty of driving while impaired by consumption of prescription drugs (NY CLS \nVTC \u00a7 1192.4), of driving while ability impaired by the consumption of alcohol (NY CLS \nVTC \u00a7 1192.1), of driving while intoxicated (NY CLS VTC \u00a7 1192.3), or of driving while \nimpaired by the combination of drugs and alcohol (NY CLS VTC \u00a7 1192.4-1 (Ex.

He also said he disclosed the \nMarch 10, 1994, marijuana possession offense and indicated he received a fine and \nprobation in response to Section 21 of his SF 86 (R. 143).  At his second hearing, he \nindicated he did not know why he did not disclose the 1999 marijuana possession \ncharge (R2. 62). \n \nApplicant\u2019s response to Section 35 of his SF 86 was \u201cNO.\u201d SOR \u00b6 2.b alleged \nthat his automobile was voluntarily repossessed in 2002 because he did not make his \ncar payments. Applicant said his car was damaged in an accident, and he believed his \ninsurance company totaled the car (R. 17-20, 46, 144-145). In his response to \ninterrogatories, Applicant said he could not remember whether the car was repossessed \n(R. 145).

He will be a valuable asset to any organization. \n   \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nIn the decision-making process, the Government has the initial burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR by \u201csubstantial evidence,\u201d \ndemonstrating, in accordance with the Directive, that it is not clearly consistent with the \n \n10 Ex. C13, Applicant\u2019s sister\u2019s statement, is the source for the facts and opinions in this \nparagraph. Ex.

The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the \nGovernment. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).12 \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), Section 3. \n \nAnalysis \n \n  \nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all \nappropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, including those described briefly \nabove, I conclude the following with respect to the allegations set forth in the SOR: \n \n \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct \n \nAG \u00b6 30 expresses the security concern pertaining to criminal conduct, \u201cCriminal \nactivity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness.

July 6, 2006).  \n \n\n \n13 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n \nAG \u00b6 31 describes two conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying, \u00b6 31(a), \u201ca single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses,\u201d and \u00b6 31(c), \n\u201callegation or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was \nformally charged, formally prosecuted or convicted.\u201d  \n \nApplicant admitted in 1990 he threw a log through a window. The criminal \nconduct in SOR \u00b6 1.a is established.  \n \nApplicant denied the 1993 offense of disorder or intoxicated conduct and assault \non a police officer or government official. The arrest did not result in a conviction. The \nevidence did not establish the 1993 offense. SOR \u00b6 1.b is not established. \n \nApplicant admitted and the records reflect in 1994 he was charged with \nmarijuana possession with intent to sell or distribute, and maintaining a vehicle or \ndwelling place containing a controlled substance. Both offenses are felonies. The \nmarijuana possession involved approximately 1000 grams of marijuana. He pleaded \nguilty and was found guilty of both counts. Although he denied knowledge that the \nmarijuana was located in a package in his residence, collateral estoppel applies. SOR \u00b6 \n1.c is established with respect to these two offenses.  \n \nIn ISCR Case No. 04-05712 at 7 (App. Bd. Oct. 31, 2006), the Appeal Board \nestablished a three-part test for determining when a guilty plea should not trigger \ncollateral estoppel: \n \nFirst, the party against whom the earlier decision is asserted must have \nbeen afforded a \u201cfull and fair opportunity\u201d to litigate that issue in the earlier \ncase. Haring v. Prosise, 462 U.S. at 313; Allen v. McCurry, 449 U.S. 90, \n95 (1980). Second, the issues presented for collateral estoppel must be \nthe same as those resolved against the opposing party in the first trial. \nMontana v. United States, 440 U.S. 147, 155 (1979). Collateral estoppel \nextends only to questions \u201cdistinctly put in issue and directly determined\u201d \nin the criminal prosecution. Frank v. Mangum, 237 U.S. 309, 334 (1915). \nThird, the application of collateral estoppel in the second hearing must not \nresult in unfairness. Parklane Hosiery Co. v. Shore, 439 U.S. 322, 330 \n(1979)(detailing circumstances where allowing the use of collateral \nestoppel would result in unfairness); Montana v. United States, 440 U.S. \nat 155 (court should consider whether other special circumstances warrant \nan exception to the normal rules of preclusion). Federal courts decline to \napply collateral estoppel where the circumstances indicate a lack of \nincentive to litigate the original matter. \u201cPreclusion is sometimes unfair if \nthe party to be bound lacked an incentive to litigate the first trial, especially \nin comparison to the stakes of the second trial.\u201d Otherson v. U.S. Dept. of \nJustice, 711 F.2d at 273. The arguments for not giving preclusive effect to \nmisdemeanor convictions are that an individual may not have the incentive \nto fully litigate a misdemeanor offense because there is so much less at \n\n \n14 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                           \nstake, or that plea bargains create an actual disincentive to litigate these \nparticular issues. See Otherson, 711 F.2d at 276. \n \nApplicant admitted that in 1994 the police found a firearm in a vehicle he was \ndriving. He denied knowledge of the firearm, but pleaded guilty to illegal firearm \npossession. Under New York Consolidated Law Service Penal \u00a7 265.01 this offense is a \nclass A misdemeanor with a maximum sentence to one year in jail. The file contains a \none-page arrest report, which lacks a description of the basis for the arrest (GE 7). \nAside from Applicant\u2019s consistent denial of culpability, there is no evidence of record for \nbelieving Applicant knowingly possessed the firearm. Because of the lenient sentence \nhe received for pleading guilty and based primarily on unfairness, I conclude collateral \nestoppel does not bar Applicant from challenging this misdemeanor conviction. See \nOtherson, 711 F.2d at 273-276. I am not convinced he knew the firearm was in the \nvehicle he was driving. I find the 1994 offense of firearm possession was not \nestablished. I find \u201cFor Applicant\u201d in regard to SOR \u00b6 1.d in the decretal paragraph of \nthis decision.   \n \nApplicant denied the 1999 marijuana possession offense. The arrest did not \nresult in a conviction. The evidence does not establish the 1999 marijuana possession. \nApplicant refuted SOR \u00b6 1.e and I find \u201cFor Applicant\u201d in the decretal paragraph of this \ndecision.  \n \nIn 2002, the police arrested Applicant for driving while intoxicated, in violation of \nNYS CLS VTC \u00a7 1192.3, after he had an accident that significantly damaged his \nvehicle. He subsequently was found guilty of driving while impaired by alcohol and/or \nprescription drugs. He denied being impaired by alcohol consumption, but contended \nhis consumption of prescription medication impaired his driving. I elect not to apply \ncollateral estoppel and to permit Applicant to challenge this conviction. I conclude after \ncarefully reviewing the police report of the incident, that he left the scene of the \naccident, and was impaired by the alcohol and prescription drug consumption while \ndriving (DUI). He failed a field sobriety test, and did not fully cooperate in the breath \nalcohol test (GE 8). I find the 2002 offense of DUI was established in regard to SOR \u00b6 \n1.f.   \n \nThe two 2004 restraining orders allege criminal misconduct, which Applicant \ndenied. There was no evidence aside from the allegations in the restraining order that \nApplicant committed the criminal conduct alleged in the restraining orders. Applicant\u2019s \nstatement is sufficient to refute the allegations of criminal conduct in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.g and \n1.h, and I find \u201cFor Applicant\u201d in the decretal paragraph of this decision.  \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.i alleges that Applicant violated 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001 by falsifying his 2005 \nSF 86 and failing to disclose information to an OPM investigator. For a violation of 18 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 1001 to occur, the falsification must be material. The Supreme Court defined \n\u201cmateriality\u201d in United States v. Gaudin, 515 U.S. 506, 512 (1995): as a statement \nhaving a \u201cnatural tendency to influence, or [be] capable of influencing, the decision \n\n \n15 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n                                                          \nmaking body to which it is addressed.\u201d See also United States v. McLaughlin, 386 F.3d \n547, 553 (3d Cir. 2004).    \n \n  \nAs indicated in the discussion below, I found that Applicant falsely failed to \ndisclose information about his 1999 charge of marijuana possession in Section 24 of his \n2005 SF 86. I also concluded the other alleged falsifications were not established. If \nApplicant had provided an accurate answer on his 2005 SF 86 about the 1999 charge of \nmarijuana possession, his accurate answer would not be capable of influencing the \ngovernment to deny his security clearance. His 1999 marijuana possession charge is \nnot sufficiently important derogatory information. The 1999 marijuana possession \ncharge occurred about five years before he signed his SF 86. The 1999 marijuana \npossession did not result in a conviction, and the underlying conduct was not \nestablished. It was not sufficiently serious13 to jeopardize approval of his security \nclearance. Making a false statement under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001 is a serious crime, a felony \n(the maximum potential sentence includes confinement for five years and a $10,000 \nfine). However, in this instance the element of materiality is not established, and thus, \nmaking a false statement under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001 is not established.  \n \n  \nIn sum, AG \u00b6\u00b6 31(a) and 31(c) apply with respect to some or all of the offenses in \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.c, and 1.f.   \n \nAG \u00b6 32 provides four conditions that could potentially mitigate security concerns: \n \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment; \n \n(b) the person was pressured or coerced into committing the act and those \npressures are no longer present in the person's life; \n \n(c) evidence that the person did not commit the offense; and \n \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited \nto the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or \nrestitution, job training or higher education, good employment record, or \nconstructive community involvement. \n \nAG \u00b6 32(a) applies to mitigate Applicant\u2019s throwing a log through a window in \n1990, as alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a. So much time has elapsed since he broke the window \n(18 years), giving this offense low probative value as a security concern. Moreover, at \nthe time of this offense, Applicant was a minor. This type of vandalism offense has not \nrecurred, and is \u201cunlikely to recur\u201d in the future. As such this offense, \u201cdoes not cast \ndoubt on [Applicant\u2019s] reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d  \n \n13 In Applicant\u2019s case, this includes aspects such as, the seriousness of the misconduct, and the \nnumber of violations of the law, regardless of whether the misconduct resulted in an arrest or conviction. \n\n \n16 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 32(a) \u2013 31(b) do not fully apply to the offense in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c and 1.f. \nPossession of marijuana in 1994 with intent to distribute is a felony. Applicant\u2019s DUI \noccurred in 2002, which is somewhat recent. Applicant admitted minimal culpability, but \ntook legal responsibility for his criminal conduct. These two criminal offenses are not \nisolated. They continue to cast doubt on Applicant\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness \nand good judgment. He was not pressured or coerced into committing the criminal \noffenses.  \n \nAG \u00b6 32(c) applies to some offenses but not to others. As indicated previously \nthe offenses in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.c, and 1.f are established and substantiated. The \noffenses in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.d through 1.i are refuted and not substantiated.   \n \nAG \u00b6 31(d) partially applies. There is some evidence of successful rehabilitation, \nincluding the passage of about six years since his DUI in 2002. Criminal activity has not \nrecurred. He expressed remorse concerning his youthful indiscretions, and he did \naccept responsibility for some of his misconduct. He has received some job training, \nand has an outstanding employment record. However, his post-offense behavior is \ninsufficient to fully mitigate the very serious misconduct in this case as described in \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c and 1.f. \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern pertaining to personal conduct: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \nAG \u00b6 16 describes two conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; and \n \n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information concerning \nrelevant facts to an employer, investigator, security official, competent \nmedical authority, or other official government representative. \n \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant deliberately provided false information or omitted \nrequired information on his 2005 SF 86 and to an OPM investigator in 2006.  Applicant\u2019s \n\n \n17 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                           \nfalsification of Section 24 of his SF 86 is substantiated; however, the other three \nallegations of falsification are not substantiated. \n \nFor Section 24 of his SF 86, he responded, \u201cYES\u201d and listed his DUI arrest in \nAugust 2002. However, he did not disclose his 1999 marijuana possession charge. In \nresponse to interrogatories he said, \u201cI did not know dismissals counted. [I d]id not \nremember. I was under the understanding that it was a booking (detainment) not an \narrest. I was never given my rights.\u201d (GE 3 at 2). At his hearing, he said he was not sure \nof the difference between being charged and a conviction (R. 43-44, 143-144). He said \nthat he did not understand that he had to disclose information that did not result in a \nconviction (R. 143). He also said he disclosed the March 10, 1994, marijuana \npossession offense and indicated he received a fine and probation in response to \nSection 21 of his SF 86 (R. 143). These explanations for not disclosing his 1999 \nmarijuana possession charge are not credible. He has misdemeanor involvement with \nlaw enforcement and the courts in 1990 and 1993, and a felony conviction in 1994, \nfollowed by misdemeanor convictions in 1994 and 2002. He impressed me as a very \nintelligent, knowledgeable Applicant. By 2005, when he completed his SF 86, he was \nwell aware of the significance of being charged, and deliberately chose not to disclose \nthe requested information about his 1999 marijuana possession charge. The falsification \nof an SF 86 need not be a material falsification to constitute a security concern. Here, \nthe 1999 marijuana possession charge was not material, but it is of sufficient \nimportance to be a security concern. \n \nFor SOR \u00b6 2.b, Applicant\u2019s vehicle was totaled in an accident. His insurance \ncompany arranged for their salvage yard to pick up Applicant\u2019s vehicle. His vehicle was \nnot repossessed by the lien holder. A credit report\u2019s statement about a vehicle being \nrepossessed is outweighed by the letter from the insurance company about the salvage \nyard taking Applicant\u2019s vehicle. He did not knowingly fail to disclose repossession of his \nvehicle on his SF 86 with intent to deceive.   \n \nFor SOR \u00b6 2.c, Applicant disclosed his 2003 family court litigation over custody of \nhis son. However, he did not disclose the August and September 2004, restraining \norders against Applicant in response to Section 40 of his SF 86. He said he did not \ndisclose them because they were dismissed and he viewed them as part of the custody \nlitigation that he disclosed previously on his SF 86. Because of the apparent linkage to \nthe custody issue, his disclosure was sufficient. \n \nSOR \u00b6 2.d alleges that on September 12, 2005, Applicant did not disclose \nsufficient information to an OPM Investigator about his 1999 arrest and charge of \nmarijuana possession of an amount greater than one half ounce and less than one and \none half ounces; and the two restraining orders against Applicant in 2004. Applicant \nexplained he did not realize he had to report a dismissed charge. He said the OPM \nInvestigator did not ask about the restraining orders. The OPM Investigator summarized \nthe interview, but the interview summary does not establish Applicant was asked to \nprovide the omitted information.   \n \n\n \n18 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n                                                          \nI find For Applicant under Guideline E for SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.b, 2.c, and 2.d.  However, I \nspecifically find that AG \u00b6 16 (a) applies with respect to SOR \u00b6 2.a.   \n \nAG \u00b6 17 provides seven conditions that could mitigate security concerns in this \ncase: \n \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was \ncaused or significantly contributed to by improper or inadequate advice of \nauthorized personnel or legal counsel advising or instructing the individual \nspecifically concerning the security clearance process. Upon being made \naware of the requirement to cooperate or provide the information, the \nindividual cooperated fully and truthfully. \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, \nor other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur; \n \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress;  \n \n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable \nreliability; and \n \n(g) association with persons involved in criminal activity has ceased or \noccurs under circumstances that do not cast doubt upon the individual's \nreliability, trustworthiness, judgment, or willingness to comply with rules \nand regulations. \n  \nNone of the mitigating conditions in AG \u00b6 17 apply to SOR \u00b6 2.a. Applicant\u2019s \n2005 falsification of his SF 86, is sufficiently recent to remain a security concern.14 He \ndid not promptly inform the government of the falsification. He continued to deny \nculpability for omitting the 1999 marijuana possession charge at his hearing in 2007. He \ndid not receive counseling designed to improve his conduct.  No one advised him to \n \n14The conduct in SOR \u00b6 2.a cannot be considered piecemeal. The Judge is required to evaluate the \nrecord evidence as a whole and reach a reasonable conclusion as to the recency of an applicant\u2019s conduct. \nISCR Case No. 03-02374 at 4 (App. Bd. Jan. 26, 2006) (citing ISCR Case No. 02-22173 at 4 (App. Bd. May \n26, 2004)). When the 2005 falsification of his SF 86 is considered in connection with the criminal conduct in \n1994 and 2002, the personal conduct in SOR \u00b6 2.a cannot be mitigated under AG \u00b6 16(c).  \n\n \n19 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                           \nfalsify his SF 86. He admitted that he omitted the 1999 marijuana possession charge, \nand the falsification of his SF 86 is substantiated. His failure to admit responsibility for \nfalsifying his 2005 SF 86 weighs against convincing me that similar misbehavior is \nunlikely to recur. The falsification of his SF 86 casts doubt on his current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and good judgment. His current service to the contractor and the \nDepartment of Defense is an important positive step towards rehabilitation, but it is not \nenough to fully mitigate his conduct. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n Under the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.     \n \nEventually Applicant admitted to security officials that he failed to disclose his \n1999 marijuana possession charge on of his 2005 SF 86. His 1990, 1994, and 2002 \nmisconduct occurred so long ago that his criminal conduct would be mitigated (in \nFebruary 2008), but for the 2005 falsification of his SF 86. He provided some evidence \nof remorse, or regret concerning his misconduct when he repeatedly stated he wanted \nto put his misconduct behind him. He said he accepted full responsibility for the \noffenses with findings of guilty, when he pleaded guilty to those offenses. He recognized \nthe damage his misconduct caused. His record of good employment weighs in his favor. \nThe statements of his college instructors, his sister, an employer and customers \ndescribed numerous very positive attributes such as his diligence, integrity, and \nenthusiasm towards his work, family and community. These factors show some \nresponsibility, rehabilitation, and mitigation. \n \n  \nThe evidence against mitigating Applicant\u2019s conduct is more substantial. His  \nfalsification of his 2005 SF 86 and his 1994, and 2002 offenses were knowledgeable \nand voluntary. (The 1990 offense was mitigated because this act of vandalism was \nminor and remote in time. He was a minor when he committed this offense.) He was \nreluctant at his 2008 hearing to fully explain the underlying facts regarding his 1994 \nfelony-level possession of marijuana with intent to distribute. I find the police report of \n\n \n20 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n                                                          \nthe 2002 DWI to be internally consistent and credible. Applicant was unwilling to admit \nthe role alcohol played in his 2002 DUI and fleeing the scene of an accident. His \nmisconduct is not isolated. He did not accept full responsibility for failing to disclose the \n1999 marijuana possession charge on his 2005 SF 86, instead contending at his 2007 \nhearing that he did not understand being charged. He had ample experience in the \ncriminal justice system, and is an intelligent man with a bachelor\u2019s degree. He knew that \nhe was charged in 1999 with marijuana possession, and he deliberately chose not to \ndisclose the information on his 2005 SF 86. He was sufficiently mature to be fully \nresponsible for his conduct. Criminal misbehavior and failure to disclose embarrassing \ninformation on his SF 86 are not prudent or responsible actions. His falsification of his \n2005 SF 86 is particularly aggravating, and weighs most heavily against granting or \ncontinuing his security clearance. He did not receive counseling or therapy, and may not \nhave a clear understanding about how to avoid future problematic situations. I have \npersistent and serious doubts about his judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness.  \n \n  \nHis misconduct calls into question his current ability or willingness to comply with \nlaws, rules and regulations. After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, \nand all the facts and circumstances, in the context of the whole person, I conclude he \nhas not mitigated the security concerns pertaining to criminal conduct and personal \nconduct.    \n \nI take this position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518 (1988), my \u201ccareful consideration of the whole person factors\u201d15 and \nsupporting evidence, my application of the pertinent factors under the Adjudicative \nProcess, and my interpretation of my  responsibilities under the Guidelines. Applicant \nhas not mitigated or overcome the government\u2019s case. For the reasons stated, I \nconclude he is not eligible for access to classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline J:   \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a and 1.b: \n For Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.d and 1.e: \n For Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.f:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.g to 1.i:  \n For Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:    \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 2.b to 2.d: \nFor Applicant \n \n \n15See ISCR Case No. 04-06242 at 2 (App. Bd.

Duffy, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se \n______________\nDecision\n______________\nHOGAN, Erin C., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted his Security Clearance Application (SF 86), on March 17,\n2006. On September 10, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under Guidelines\nE and M for Applicant. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865,\nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended;\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised\nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and\neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on September 13, 2007. He\nanswered the SOR in writing on September 21, 2007, and requested a decision on the\nwritten record. DOHA received the request on September 26, 2007. Department\nCounsel submitted a File of Relevant Material (FORM) on October 31, 2007.  Applicant\nreceived a copy of the FORM on November 6, 2007.  He responded to the FORM on\nNovember 18, 2007. The FORM as well as Applicant\u2019s response to the FORM was\nforwarded to the hearing office on November 30, 2007. I received the case assignment\nJanuary 16, 2008\n\n Item 5. \n1\n Item 5. \n2\n Item 8. \n3\n Item 7 at 6.\n4\n Item 7 at 3-4. \n5\n Item 7 at 9. \n6\n2\non December 10, 2007. Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, and exhibits,\neligibility for access to classified information is denied.\nFindings of Fact\nIn his Answer to the SOR, dated September 21, 2007, Applicant denied all the\nallegations.\nApplicant is a 54-year-old employee of a defense contractor seeking to maintain\na security clearance. He submitted a security clearance application on March 17, 2006.1\nHe has held a security clearance since 1989.2\nIn March 2003, Applicant was hired by a defense contractor to work on a\nprogram which provided television services to military ships at sea. The company was a\nsubcontractor to the main company who was awarded the contract.3\nIn March 2005, the company encountered a funding issue with the government.\nOn March 2, 2005, Applicant\u2019s program manager sent out an e-mail indicating that until\nfunding was in place all communications with the government customer should be\nfiltered through him or the main contractor.  \n4\nIn March/April 2005, Applicant\u2019s program manager became suspicious of\nApplicant\u2019s \u201cover-involved\u201d interaction with the government employees who worked on\nthe contract. He received approval to search Applicant\u2019s e-mail activity on the office\nserver. The initial review of Applicant\u2019s e-mail provided nothing substantive but the\nprogram manager continued to monitor his work e-mail.  \n5\nOn March 17, 2005, Applicant\u2019s wife sent the program manager an e-mail on\nApplicant\u2019s work e-mail account accusing him of lacking compassion pertaining to a\nknee injury Applicant suffered.   This raised an issue about her unauthorized use of the\n6\ncompany e-mail system. Applicant explained in his response to the FORM that he was\nchecking his e-mail while at home on sick leave. His wife was there when he was\nreviewing his e-mails and became upset about his program manager\u2019s lack of sympathy\n\n Response to FORM, dated November 18, 2007.\n7\n  Item 7. \n8\n  Item 6.\n9\n Item 8. \n10\n3\nfor his medical condition which resulted in her sending an e-mail to the program\nmanager on Applicant\u2019s business e-mail account.7\nThe program manager continued to review Applicant\u2019s e-mail. He discovered that\non June 1, 2005, Applicant sent a training guide that was not finalized to the\ngovernment employees who were working on the contract. The rule that all\ncommunications with the government customer should be filtered through the program\nmanager or the principal contractor was still in effect.  Applicant sent additional items of\ninformation to the government customer without authorization. The items included\ninformation that management considered proprietary information belonging to the main\ncontractor and another company. The release of this information made Applicant\u2019s\ncompany vulnerable to litigation.  Applicant also made several disparaging comments in\nthe e-mails sent to the government customer about his boss (the program manager)\nand the main contractor.8\nOn June 13, 2005, Applicant\u2019s employer terminated him for 1) insubordination\nand willful disobedience of assignments and/or orders; 2) disclosure of company\nprocesses and records that originated due to the company\u2019s development and\nproduction; 3) removal of company records without authorization; 4) break of\nconfidentiality to the company, his supervisor and co-workers as well as other\ncontractors involved in the program; and 5) conflict of interest.  \n9\nOn the same day that he was terminated, Applicant called the program manager\nof the government agency who Applicant worked with on the contract. She advised him\nto wait for a phone call. He received a phone call from another defense contractor and\nwas hired by that defense contractor the same day. Although he was completely\nshocked about the basis for his termination, he did not rebut the charges because he\nhad obtained new employment.  He indicated in his response to the FORM that the\n10\nprogram manager of the government customer did not want to lose access to this\ntechnical expertise. \nIn his response to the SOR, dated September 21, 2007, Applicant maintains that\nhe did not release proprietary information to the government customer. He claims that\nthe technical manual and training guide were government property and that his former\nemployer had no claim to them. Any work provided by his former employer was\nperformed with products developed by the system\u2019s original equipment manufacturer.\nHe also claims that his supervisor and the principal contractor were aware of any e-\nmails sent to the government customer because they were copied on any e-mail\ntransmissions related to the contract. Applicant did not provide additional documentation\n\n Item 7 at 6-26. \n11\n Item 7 at 13.\n12\n Item 4. \n13\n Response to FORM, dated November 18, 2007. \n14\n4\nverifying that he sent copies of the items sent to the government agency to his program\nmanager and the main contractor. The e-mails the company attached to the termination\nmemorandum do not show Applicant sent copies to his supervisor and the main\ncontractor.   In fact, Applicant blind copied the program manager of the government\n11\ncustomer on e-mail correspondence that he sent to the main contractor.12\nApplicant disputes the conflict of interest allegation. He states that he held no\nother jobs and his work consisted solely of the work assigned to him as part of the\nsubcontract.   \n13\nIn his response to the FORM, dated November 18, 2007, Applicant states that it\nwas his first opportunity to review a copy of the program manager\u2019s memorandum which\noutlines the basis for Applicant\u2019s termination. He claims that any proof that he would\nneed to counter these allegations was contained in his company e-mail account, which,\nhe no longer has access to because of his termination. He claims that the main\ncontractor instructed him to send the training documents back to the government\ncustomer via e-mail and that he copied both the main contractor and his program\nmanager on the e-mail transmissions.  He states that claims of disseminating another\ncompany\u2019s proprietary information is false. He states the information came from the\ncompany\u2019s manual and that the government customer\u2019s engineers have access to all\nequipment for the program. Anyone with access to the equipment has the ability to open\nthe equipment and document the wiring of the cards and/or interconnection within the\nequipment. He states this is a standard trouble-shooting procedure when dealing with\nsystem problems on board ships. He believes that his former program manager has\ntreated him unfairly since November 2004, after he suffered from a heart attack. He\nprovided the name and number of the government employee he worked closely with on\nthe contract. He claims that she will verify that he was the sole source of system\nexpertise which is why she made an effort to find him another job with a company that\nshe would have access to his knowledge.  \n14\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\n\n5\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline E, Personal Conduct\nThe Government established a prima facie case under Guideline E, Personal\nConduct. The overall security concern relating to the Personal Conduct guideline is set\nout in AG & 15:      \n\n6\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure tor provide truthful\nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other\nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.  \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. PC DC\n\u00b6 16(d) (credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any other single\nguideline, but which, when combined with all available information supports a whole-\nperson assessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of\ncandor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other characteristics\nindicating that the person may not properly safeguard protected information: This\nincludes but is not limited to consideration of: (1) untrustworthy or unreliable behavior to\ninclude breach of client confidentiality , release of proprietary information, unauthorized\nrelease of sensitive corporate or other government protected information; (3) a pattern\nof dishonesty or rule violations) applies to Applicant\u2019s case. \nThe government established a prima facie case that Applicant was terminated\nfrom his employment with a defense contractor in June 2005 for insubordination or\nwillful disobedience of assignments or orders; disclosure of company processes and\nrecords that originated due to the company\u2019s development and production; removing\ncompany records without authorization; breach of confidentiality to his company, his\nsupervisor, co-workers and other contractors working on the contract; and conflict of\ninterest. \nThe record evidence establishes that Applicant willfully disobeyed his program\nmanager\u2019s order to filter any communications with the government contractor through\nthe program manager or the main contractor. Applicant forwarded the training manual\nhe was working on directly to the government customer without consulting with the\nprogram manager or the main contractor.  Applicant maintains that he copied the\nprogram manager and the main contractor when e-mailing the documents to the\ngovernment customer but has provided nothing to verify this action. Even if he did so,\nthe order directs that employees contact the program manager or main contractor\nbefore communicating or sending information to the government contractor.  Even if he\ncopied the program manager and the main contractor in his e-mail, he still did not follow\nthe terms of the order. Applicant did not coordinate with them prior to sending the\ndocument. It is clear from the program manager\u2019s memorandum outlining the cause for\ntermination that the order was still in effect at the time Applicant forwarded the\ninformation to the government contractor.\nApplicant\u2019s blind copying the government customer on certain e-mail\ntransmissions that he sent to the main contractor is a breach of confidentiality. The\ndisclosure of company processes and records allegation relates to the information sent\nto the government customer about another contractor\u2019s proprietary information\npertaining to the development of the product. Although Applicant maintains the\n\n Directive, \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n15\n7\ninformation was not proprietary, his former employer thought otherwise.  Aside from his\nown assertions, he provided no documents verifying that the information was not\nconsidered proprietary by the company who developed the product.\nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security\nconcerns arising from personal conduct. Two Personal Conduct Mitigating Conditions\n(PC MC) are potentially applicable to Applicant\u2019s case. PC MC \u00b6 17c (the offense is so\nminor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is so infrequent, or it happened\nunder such unique circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on\nthe individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment) does not apply. Applicant\u2019s\ncompany considered his conduct so serious that it warranted termination. The company\nwas particularly concerned about their vulnerability to being sued by the main contractor\nand the other company whose proprietary information was released without\nauthorization. The e-mail communications reveal that Applicant had little respect for the\nprogram manager and the main contractor. His disparaging comments about his\nsuperiors in e-mails with the government customer demonstrate poor judgment. Blind\ncopying e-mail communications sent to the main contractor to the government customer\nraises issues about his trustworthiness.  Applicant was terminated from employment in\n2005. It is too soon the conclude that sufficient time has passed to indicate that\nApplicant\u2019s conduct no longer raises doubts about his reliability, trustworthiness, and\ngood judgment.\nPC MC \u00b6 17(d) (the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained\ncounseling to change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate stressors,\ncircumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, or other inappropriate\nbehavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur) does not apply. Applicant maintains\nthat he did nothing wrong and therefore has taken no steps to rectify his past conduct.\nWhile he has several explanations for his conduct, he provided no corroborating\nevidence to support his assertions.  \nThe government established a prima facie case raising security concerns under\npersonal conduct. As such, Applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to\nobtaining a favorable clearance decision.   Applicant has not met that burden. \n15\nGuideline M, Use of Information Technology Systems\nThe government did not establish a prima facie case under Guideline M. The\nsecurity concern under Guideline M is set in AG \u00b6 39:\nNoncompliance with rules, procedures, guidelines or regulations pertaining\nto information technology systems may raise security concerns about an\nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, calling into question the\nwillingness or ability to properly protect sensitive systems, networks and\ninformation. Information Technology Systems include all related computer\n\n8\nhardware, software, firmware, and data used for the communication,\ntransmission, processing, manipulation, storage, or protection of\ninformation.\nThere is nothing in the record evidence that indicates Applicant misused the\ninformation technology systems. No rules, procedures, guidelines or regulations\npertaining to the company information technology systems were included in the record\nwhich would raise questions pertaining to Applicant\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness with\nregard to the protection of sensitive systems, network and information. While there was\none occasion where Applicant\u2019s wife sent his program manager an e-mail from\nApplicant\u2019s company e-mail account complaining about the program manager\u2019s lack of\ncompassion pertaining the Applicant\u2019s medical condition, there is nothing else which\nindicates Applicant misused or manipulated the company\u2019s information technology\nsystems. Granted, Applicant did not demonstrate the best judgment in allowing his wife\nto send the program manager an e-mail on his business account, however, there were\nno other instances where his wife used Applicant\u2019s company e-mail. Considering the\ncompany was monitoring Applicant\u2019s e-mail, they would have discovered further e-mails\nif she had.  Guideline M is found for Applicant.  \nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation\nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent\nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case.  Applicant was a mature adult at the\ntime he committed the conduct which was the basis for his termination. His conduct was\nunprofessional and he fails to acknowledge any wrongdoing and/or provide evidence\nsupporting his assertions that he did not disobey company orders, breach company\nconfidentiality, or disclose another company\u2019s proprietary information without\nauthorization. He provided minimal information about his current employment situation.\nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s\neligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude\n\n9\nApplicant did not mitigate the security concerns arising under the personal conduct\nguideline. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline E:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline M:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n                                              \n_________________\nERIN C. HOGAN\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Goldstein, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro se\nFebruary 4, 2008\n______________\nDECISION\n______________\nROSS, Wilford H., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted his Security Clearance Application (SF 86), on October 26,\n2004 (Government Exhibit 1).  On May 7, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and\nAppeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns\nunder Guidelines E and J concerning the Applicant.  The action was taken under\nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February\n20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial\nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended\n(Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by President Bush\non December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs\nissued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant submitted an Answer to the SOR on July 5, 2007, and requested a\nhearing before an Administrative Judge.  Department Counsel was prepared to proceed\non September 6, 2007.  I received the case assignment on September 12, 2007.  DOHA\nissued a notice of hearing on September 25, 2007, and I convened the hearing as\nscheduled on October 11, 2007. The Government offered Government Exhibits 1\n\nGovernment Exhibit 1 is not signed by the Applicant.  He did testify that the exhibit was a true copy of his\n1\nquestionnaire, that the answers were his, and that he knew when it was filled out that he was required to be\ntrue, complete and correct in his answers.  (Transcript at 33-34.)\n2\nthrough 5, which were received without objection. Applicant testified on his own behalf\nand submitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibits A and B, without objection. DOHA received the\ntranscript of the hearing on October 22, 2007.  The record closed on October 22, 2007.\nBased upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for\naccess to classified information is denied.\nFindings of Fact\nThe Applicant is 29 and married.  He is employed by a defense contractor as a\nSecurity Guard and seeks to obtain a security clearance in connection with his\nemployment.\nGuideline E - Personal Conduct\nGuideline J - Criminal Conduct\nThe Applicant was involved in a robbery in March 1999, when he was 20 years\nold.  He drove the getaway car when his brother robbed a man.  The Applicant credibly\ntestified that he did not know his brother intended to rob anyone at the time.  The\nApplicant was subsequently arrested and charged with one count of Robbery and one\ncount of Assault and Battery.  Subsequent to his arrest the Applicant spent six weeks in\nthe county jail because he could not afford the bail.  Because of the relatively minor\nextent of his involvement with the offense, he plead guilty to the lesser charge of\nAccessory to Robbery.  He was sentenced to 80 hours of community service, which he\ncompleted.  (Transcript at 20-24.)\nIn October 2004 the Applicant applied for a job with his present employer.  As\npart of the application process, the Applicant was required to fill out a Company\nEmployee Application (Government Exhibit 2) and a Defense Department Security\nClearance Application (Government Exhibit 1).   \n1\nGovernment Exhibit 2 asks the following question at page 2, \u201cHave you ever\nbeen convicted or plead guilty to a felony or misdemeanor?\u201d  The Applicant answered\nthis question, \u201cNo.\u201d  This answer was false.\nGovernment Exhibit 1 asks the following as question 22.f., \u201cIn the last seven\nyears, have you been arrested for, charged with, or convicted of any offense(s) not\nlisted in response to [questions 22.] a, b, c, d or e above?\u201d  The Applicant answered,\n\u201cNo.\u201d  This answer was also false.\n\n3\nAt the hearing, the Applicant explained his thinking concerning how he filled out\nthe Company Employee Application as follows:\nWell, prior to answering this question [on Government Exhibit 2], I\nhad spoken to my employer . . . about my incident in . . . 1999.  And due to\nthe fact that it happened in 1999, he kind of led me to understand that it\nwasn\u2019t necessary for me to add it because it wasn\u2019t a felony on my behalf.\nIt was a misdemeanor and I thought that because I did some jail time, it\nhad been erased from my record.  So, I didn\u2019t feel that it was necessary to\nput \u201cyes\u201d for the answer.  (Transcript at 27-28.) \nThe Applicant further testified that his supervisor did not tell him to answer the\nquestion, \u201cNo.\u201d (Transcript at 28-29.)  Finally, he stated that his supervisor also said \u201cit\nwasn\u2019t important for me to put it down.\u201d  (Transcript at 31.)  This supervisor no longer\nworks for the company.  The Applicant provided no independent confirmation of his\nversion of events.\nThe Applicant testified that he had basically the same motivation when he filled\nout Government Exhibit 1, the Security Clearance Application.  (Transcript at 40-41.)\nThe Government also submitted Government Exhibit 5.  This is a Security Clearance\nApplication signed by the Applicant January 11, 2006.  This document appears to be a\nreprint of Government Exhibit 2, with some corrections by the Applicant.  Question 26 of\nthis Application also asks whether the Applicant has been arrested, charged or\nconvicted of any offense not otherwise listed on the form within the last seven years.\nOnce again the Applicant answered, \u201cNo.\u201d  This was still a false answer to the question.\nHis explanation was that he was in a hurry and just did what the receptionist in the office\ntold him to do, which was sign the document.  He just did not read it.  (Transcript at 42-\n43.)\nThe Applicant stated that he regretted these falsifications.  He further testified, in\nthe future, he would be honest about what he had done in his past.  (Transcript at 40.)  \nMitigation\nThe Applicant submitted documentary evidence showing that he is a highly\nrespected person and employee.  His current supervisor states, \u201cI find [the Applicant] of\ngood character and would trust him with confidential company information as well as\nclassified information at the site that he currently works.\u201d  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit A.)  \nThe Manager of Industrial Security for the contractor where the Applicant works\n(not his employing company) states, \u201cHaving known him for a period of three years, I\nhave been very impressed with [the Applicant] and have appreciated his contributions to\nmy department and our facility.  I have never observed any conduct on the part of [the\nApplicant] that would give me a reason to suspect that he is anything but an honest\nindividual and loyal American citizen.\u201d  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit B at 1.) \n\n4\nPolicies\nSecurity clearance decisions are not made in a vacuum.  When evaluating an\nApplicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the Administrative Judge must consider\nthe revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief introductory explanations for\neach guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and\nmitigating conditions, which are useful in evaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access\nto classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.  In addition, the Administrative Judge may also rely on his own\ncommon sense, as well as his knowledge of the law, human nature, and the ways of the\nworld, in making a reasoned decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Security clearance decisions include, by\nnecessity, consideration of the possible risk that the Applicant may deliberately or\ninadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a\ncertain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk\nof compromise of classified information.\n \nFinally, as emphasized by President Eisenhower in Section 7 of Executive Order\n10865, \u201cAny determination under this order . . . shall be a determination in terms of the\nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\n\n5\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline E, Personal Conduct\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in\nAG & 15:      \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor,\ndishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information.  Of special interest is any failure to provide\ntruthful and candid answers during the security clearance process or any\nother failure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nAG & 16(a), the \u201cdeliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from\nany personnel security questionnaire,\u201d is potentially disqualifying.  Similarly under AG &\n16(b), Adeliberately providing false or misleading information concerning relevant facts\nto an employer@ may also raise security concerns. The Applicant falsified relevant\ninformation concerning his criminal record to his employer and twice to the Government.\nThe evidence is sufficient to raise these potentially disqualifying conditions, requiring a\ncloser examination.\nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security\nconcerns arising from personal conduct involving falsifications. Under AG \u00b6 17(a), the\ndisqualifying condition may be mitigated where \u201cthe individual made prompt, good-faith\nefforts to correct the omission, concealment, or falsification before being confronted with\nthe facts.\u201d  There is no evidence that the Applicant made such a correction to his record.\nThis mitigating condition is not applicable to this case.  \nAs stated above, the Applicant argues that he was misled by his then manager\ninto making the falsifications.  AG \u00b6 17(b) states that the disqualifying conditions may be\nmitigated where \u201cthe refusal or failure to cooperate, omission or concealment was\ncaused or significantly contributed to by improper or inadequate advice of authorized\npersonnel or legal counsel advising or instructing the individual specifically concerning\nthe security clearance process.  Upon being made aware of the requirement to\ncooperate or provide the information, the individual cooperated fully and truthfully.\u201d  The\nApplicant admits that his former supervisor never told him to answer the question\nimproperly.  Based on my analysis of the available evidence, it appears that the\nApplicant made the decision to make false statements on his own.  In addition, there is\nno evidence that the Applicant came forward to correct the falsifications at any time\nbefore he was interviewed by the Defense Security Service in 2006.  (Government\n\n6\nExhibit 3.)  Under the particular circumstances of this case, I cannot find that this\nmitigating condition is applicable.  \nGuideline J - Criminal Conduct\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Criminal Conduct is set out in\nAG & 390:      \nCriminal activity creates doubts about a person\u2019s judgment,\nreliability, and trustworthiness.  By its very nature, it calls into question a\nperson\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations.\nThe Applicant was involved in a minor criminal incident in 1999.  From all\nindications, he was not the prime mover in this incident, as was shown by his guilty plea\nto a misdemeanor and the award of community service as a sentence.  AG \u00b6 31(a)\napplies to this case, stating that a disqualifying condition is \u201ca single serious crime of\nmultiple lesser offenses.\u201d\nHowever, several of the mitigating conditions also apply and justify a finding for\nthe Applicant as to this Guideline.  They are AG \u00b6 32(a ), \u201cso much time has elapsed\nsince the criminal behavior happened, or it happened under such unusual\ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s\nreliability, trustworthiness or good judgment\u201d; and AG \u00b6 32(b), \u201cthere is evidence of\nsuccessful rehabilitation; including but not limited to the passage of time without\nrecurrence of criminal activity, remorse or restitution, job training or higher education,\ngood employment record, or constructive community involvement.\u201d  \nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances.  The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation\nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent\nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case.  The Applicant is a hard-working,\nhighly respected, professional person who has overcome his earlier criminal conviction.\nHowever, on at least three occasions, the Applicant gave false answers about his\n\n7\ncriminal record to his employer and the Government.   The fact that I find that Criminal\nConduct to be mitigated is not relevant to a decision on the falsification.  The\nGovernment had a right to know about the conviction and then make a decision about\nthe Applicant\u2019s security worthiness.\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(a)(3), the conduct occurred as recently as 2006.  The Applicant\ncontinues to attempt to justify his falsifications by reference to his then supervisor.\nHowever, the ultimate decision was always his.  I am not convinced that he has a\nproper understanding of how he got in these circumstances.  Accordingly, I cannot find\nthat there have been permanent behavioral changes under AG \u00b6 2(a)(6).  Accordingly,\nat the present time, I cannot find that there is little to no potential for pressure, coercion,\nexploitation, or duress (AG \u00b62(a)8)), or that the likelihood of recurrence is close to nil\n(AG \u00b62(a)9)). \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and/or doubts as to\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I\nconclude the Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns arising from his personal\nconduct.  \nOn balance, it is concluded that the Applicant has not successfully overcome the\nGovernment's case opposing his request for a DoD security clearance.  Accordingly, the\nevidence supports a finding against the Applicant as to the factual and conclusionary\nallegations expressed in Paragraph 1 of the Government's Statement of Reasons.  As\nstated above, Paragraph 2 is found for the Applicant.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline E:\nAGAINST THE APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst the Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline J:\nFOR THE APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nFor the Applicant\n\n8\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n                                              \n_________________\nWILFORD H. ROSS\nAdministrative Judge\n",

She is underemployed and has been unemployed for long periods of time. She has four\nchildren and her husband is unemployed. She and her family have incurred substantial medical\nexpenses because they have been uninsured and have had difficulty paying copayments. Applicant\nis saving money from her paycheck and has paid some creditors. She is setting up a repayment plan\nthrough a consumer credit counseling service. She was confused when she completed her security\nclearance application and unintentionally failed to list some information. Applicant has mitigated\nthe security concerns under Guideline F, financial considerations, Guideline E, personal conduct, and\nGuideline J, criminal conduct. Clearance is granted.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a\nsecurity clearance for Applicant. As required by Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 \u00b6 E3.1.2\n(Jan. 2, 1992), as amended, DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) on January 16, 2007,\ndetailing the basis for its decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline F (financial\nconsiderations), Guideline E (personal conduct), and Guideline J (criminal conduct) of the revised\nAdjudicative Guidelines issued on December 29, 2005, and implemented by the Department of\nDefense effective September 1, 2006. The revised guidelines were provided to Applicant when the\nSOR was issued. Applicant answered the SOR in writing on February 2, 2007, and elected to have\na hearing before an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on March 12, 2007. With the\nconsent of the parties, I convened a hearing on April 18, 2007, to consider whether it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. The\nGovernment offered three exhibits that were marked as GE 1-3 and admitted without objections.\nApplicant testified on her behalf and did  not offer any documents. The record was left open to allow\nApplicant to submit documents, which she did in a timely manner. The exhibits were marked as AE\nA-G and admitted without objections. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on April 27, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant is 40 years old and has worked as a security guard for a federal contractor since\nOctober 2005. She has been married for 16 years and is the mother of four children ages 15, 13, 9\nand 8. Her eldest child has serious respiratory problems that requires frequent emergency medical\ntreatment. Their family lives with his mother and pays the mortgage on the home. It is located in a\ndangerous part of town. Applicant works nights and is not comfortable leaving the children with\ntheir grandmother alone. Her husband is presently unemployed and is responsible for caring for the\nchildren in the evening. \nThe SOR alleges 20 delinquent debts, of those 16 are for medical debts incurred by Applicant\nto care of the needs or her family or herself. Her children are currently on medicaid to pay for their\nmedical needs. Her eldest daughter has a serious health issue and frequently needs emergency room\ncare. Many of Applicant\u2019s debts are for emergency room visits. Applicant has a very small income,\nbut has been saving $50 a paycheck to pay off some of her debts. She presently has the means to pay\n\n3\noff five of the delinquent accounts. However, in attempting to do so she has been passed back and\nforth between collection agencies and creditors who can not identify her debts or do not have current\naccount numbers or have different account numbers. Despite her attempts she has been frustrated\nby the creditor/collection agencies bureaucracy. \nPrior to her current employment, Applicant was unemployed for approximately two years,\nfrom October 2003 to October 2005. She worked for a federal transportation service from November\n2001 to October 2003. Earlier in 2003, Applicant suffered a mild stroke and was out of work for\napproximately four months. She was not paid during this time. Her husband was working during this\ntime. When she returned to work in October 2003 she was required to take a certification test. She\ncould not pass the test so she was terminated. In 1999, Applicant contracted meningitis and was very\nsick and could not return to work for approximately six months. During this time her husband was\nworking. She is diabetic and requires regular medical check ups twice every three months and regular\nmedication. She must wait for \u201copen season\u201d to be covered by her employer for medical benefits,\nso she is currently uninsured, but the children receive medicare. She and her husband do not have\nany credit cards.\nFour delinquent debts are not for medical necessities. The debt in SOR 1.a is from a catalog\ncompany where she purchased merchandise on one occasion. It has been in a delinquent status since\n2003. The debt in SOR 1.f is for tires she purchased. She stated she did make payments, but the\nremainder of the debt is unpaid. The debt in SOR 1.g is to a video store. This debt has been paid. The\ndebt in SOR 1.s is for a credit card debt that went delinquent when she lost her job. The debt remains\nunpaid. \nOn December 3, 2002, Applicant was charged for failure to maintain financial responsibility\n(no car insurance) and failure to wear her seat belt. She was again charged on July 20, 2005 for\nfailing to maintain financial responsibility and failure to yield right of way. Her reason in both cases\nfor failing to have car insurance was because she did not have the money. She presently has car\ninsurance. She paid the fines related to the charges.\nOn October 12, 2003, Applicant was charged with theft by writing a bad check. She believed\nwhen she wrote the check that there were sufficient funds in her account to cover the check and there\nwere not. She did not receive a notice from the bank about her account. She paid the fine and was\nreleased. Applicant failed to list this offense on her security clearance application (SCA). Applicant\ncredibly testified that she was told by the bail bondsman that all she had to do was make restitution\nand pay the fine. She never went to court or entered a plea. The charges were dismissed.  She\ntestified credibly that she was confused by the questions and believed she only had to list felonies.\nShe did not understand that she was required to list any arrests, charges or convictions she may have\nhad. \nApplicant pays her taxes and does not have any credit cards. She and her husband drive older\nmodel vehicles that are paid for. Applicant is responsible for managing all of the family\u2019s finances.\nHer husband has been unemployed for 18 months and there was a period of time when they were\nboth unemployed. The reason Applicant did not pay her debts is because during certain periods of\ntime she did not have the money. She does not have a phone and limits the family\u2019s spending. She\ndoes not buy the children new clothes or shoes unless they absolutely need them. The younger\n\nDepartment of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).\n1\nId. at 527.\n2\nExec.

She is hoping to save some money when the children\nbreak for the summer so they will not need school supplies. \nApplicant has sought financial assistance through a credit counseling service. She is\nproviding them with a list of her creditors and they are assisting her in formulating a realistic\nrepayment plan. She anticipates they will negotiate settlements with some of the creditors. She is\nattempting to pay some of the small debts and has contacted some of the creditors regarding her\noutstanding debts. She also anticipates that her husband will resume work in the next month so they\nwill have two incomes. Applicant believes with two incomes they can resolve their debts, live within\ntheir means and stay current on their expenses. Applicant and her family have had many medical\nissues. She does not drink, smoke or gamble and her children are happy and on the honor roll.\nPOLICIES\n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d  As Commander in Chief, the President has\n1\n\u201cthe authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national security and to determine\nwhether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position . . . that will give that person\naccess to such information.\u201d  The President authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to\n2\ngrant applicants eligibility for access to classified information \u201c only upon a finding that it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d  An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of\n3\ndemonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security\nclearance.\u201d  \u201cThe clearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations should\n4\nerr, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d  Any reasonable doubt about whether an applicant should\n5\nbe allowed access to sensitive information must be resolved in favor of protecting such sensitive\ninformation.  The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a\n6\ndetermination as to the loyalty of an applicant.  It is merely an indication that the applicant has not\n7\nmet the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a\nclearance.8\nThe revised Adjudicative Guidelines set forth potentially disqualifying conditions (DC) and\nmitigating conditions (MC) under each guideline. In evaluating the security worthiness of an\napplicant, the administrative judge must also assess the adjudicative process factors listed in \u00b6 6.3\nof the Directive to be considered in evaluating a person\u2019s eligibility to hold a security clearance.\n\n5\nAdditionally, each security clearance decision must be a fair and impartial commonsense decision\nbased on the relevant and material facts and circumstances, the whole-person concept, along with\nthe factors listed in the Directive. Specifically these are: (1) the nature and seriousness of the conduct\nand surrounding circumstances; (2) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (3) the age of the\napplicant; (4) the motivation of the applicant, and the extent to which the conduct was negligent,\nwillful, voluntary, or undertaken with knowledge of the consequences; (5) the absence or presence\nof rehabilitation; and (6) the probability that the circumstances or conduct will continue or recur in\nthe future. Although the presence or absence of a particular condition or factor for or against\nclearance is not outcome determinative, the revised adjudicative guidelines should be followed\nwhenever a case can be measured against this policy guidance.\nConditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying, as well as those\nwhich would mitigate security concerns, pertaining to the adjudicative guidelines are set forth and\ndiscussed in the conclusions below.\nCONCLUSIONS\nBased upon consideration of the evidence, I find the following adjudicative guidelines most\npertinent to the evaluation of the facts in this case:\nGuideline F-Financial Considerations are a concern because failure or inability to live within\none\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of\njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about\nan individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. An individual\nwho is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.\nCompulsive gambling is a concern as it may lead to financial crimes including espionage. Affluence\nthat cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a security concern. It may indicate\nproceeds from financially profitable criminal acts.\nGuideline E-Personal Conduct is a concern because conduct involving questionable\njudgment, lack of candor, dishonest, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified\ninformation. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful and candid answers during the\nsecurity clearance process or any other failure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\nGuideline J-Criminal Conduct is a security concern because criminal activity creates doubt\nabout a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question\na person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations. \nBased on all the evidence, Financial Considerations Disqualifying Condition (FC DC) 19(a)\n(inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts) and FC DC 19(c) (a history of not meeting financial\nobligations), apply in this case. Applicant has numerous delinquent debts that she only recently has\nstarted to resolve. The debts date back to 2000.\nI have considered all the Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions (FC MC), and\nespecially considered FC MC 20(a) (the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or\noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the\n\n6\nindividual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment), FC MC 20(b) (the conditions\nthat resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of\nemployment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or\nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances), FC MC 20(c) (the\nperson received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear indications that\nthe problem is being resolved or is under control), and FC MC 20(d) (the individual initiated a\ngood-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts).\nApplicant\u2019s debts are recent because they remain unpaid. There are also many debts so her\nbehavior is not infrequent. Because of her employment situation I can not find that the event is\nunlikely to recur. Therefore, FC MC 20(a) does not apply.\nApplicant has a big family and most of her delinquent debts are for unpaid copayments for\nmedical bills. She has a daughter with a serious medical condition. Applicant has suffered from\nmeningitis, a stroke, and is a diabetic. All of these debilitating conditions have caused substantial\nmedical expenses and caused her to be unemployed. While unemployed she did not have medical\ninsurance thereby escalating the problem. Her husband also has been unemployed during long\nperiods. Because of her low income, she can not afford to live in a safer neighborhood and she is\nconcerned for the safety of her children, so her husband does not work nights so he can stay home\nwith the children. Applicant\u2019s debts are not the result of frivolous or irresponsible spending, or living\nbeyond her means, but rather are from being underemployed, unemployed, medical problems and\nlack of medical insurance, and having a family of six that she is responsible for on a meager income.\nI find all of these circumstances were beyond her control and had a major impact on her ability to\npay her debts. Applicant has acted responsibly under the circumstances and therefore FC MC 20(b)\napplies. \nApplicant is receiving financial counseling and is setting up a repayment plan. She has paid\nsome of the small medical copayments and the consumer credit service is helping negotiate\nsettlements for her other debts. She saves $50 from her paycheck and slowly is repaying some of her\ndebts. There is clear indication Applicant is committed to resolving her delinquencies and is making\na good-faith effort to do so. She anticipates her husband being employed in the near future and that\nwill expedite her repayment plan. I find FC MC 20(c) and (d) apply.\nI have considered Personal Conduct Disqualifying Conditions (PC DC) 16(a) (deliberate\nomission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any personnel security questionnaire,\npersonal history statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment\nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness,\nor award fiduciary responsibilities.) and PC MC 16(c) (personal conduct, or concealment of\ninformation about one\u2019s conduct, that creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or\nduress,\u2026).  I considered Applicant\u2019s testimony, demeanor and candor and conclude she did not\ndeliberately or intentionally omit information on her SCA. She credibly testified she was confused\nand thought she did not have to include certain information. Regarding the bad check offense,\nApplicant had an overdraft on her account and was not notified by the bank. She made restitution\nand paid a fine. I do not find this is the type of conduct that creates a vulnerability to exploitation,\nmanipulation or duress. She resolved the issue. Considering all of the evidence, I find none of the\ndisqualifying conditions apply and therefore it is unnecessary to consider any of the mitigating\nconditions. \n\n7\nI concluded Applicant did not intentionally or deliberate falsify her SCA and therefore I\nconclude she did not violate Title 18 U.S.C.\u00a7 1001. I find that none of the Criminal Conduct\nDisqualifying Conditions apply. \nWhole Person Analysis\nIn all adjudications, the protection of our national security is the paramount concern. The\nobjective of the security-clearance process is the fair-minded, commonsense assessment of a person\u2019s\nlife to make an affirmative determination that the person is eligible for a security clearance. Indeed,\nthe adjudicative process is a careful weighing of a number of variables in considering the \u201cwhole\nperson\u201d concept. It recognizes that we should view a person by the totality of their acts, omissions,\nmotivations and other variables. Each case must be adjudged on its own merits, taking into\nconsideration all relevant circumstances, and applying sound judgment, mature thinking, and careful\nanalysis.\nI considered the whole person in evaluating the case. I considered Applicant\u2019s credibility,\ndemeanor and responsiveness when testifying. Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts result from being\nunemployed, underemployed, and medical issues that were beyond her control. She has a meager\nsalary and is supporting a large family. She has taken constructive action to repay her debts. She does\nnot spend beyond her means and is frugal. Applicant\u2019s good faith efforts to resolve her debts are\nindications that she is getting her financial issues under control. I find Applicant has successfully\nmitigated the security concerns raised under Guideline F, financial conditions, Guideline E, personal\nconduct, and Guideline J, criminal conduct. \nFORMAL FINDINGS\nThe following are my conclusions as to each allegation in the SOR:\nParagraph 1. Guideline F:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a-1.v:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2. Guideline E:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 3.

ABLARD\nAPPEARANCES\nFOR GOVERNMENT\nNichole Noel, Esq. , Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nSYNOPSIS\nApplicant, an employee of a government contractor, encountered financial difficulties when\nhe moved from one state to another to take his employment  only to have limited work available for\nhim much of the time. His wife was unemployed after the birth of a child. Although they are now\nboth employed and are in credit counseling to resolve their delinquent debts, not enough time has\nelapsed to take sufficient action to justify the grant of a clearance at this time. Clearance is denied.\nSTATEMENT OF CASE\nOn or about March 6, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant\n\n2\nto Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry, as amended and\nmodified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended and modified, and\nsubject to the revised Adjudicative Guidelines effective September 1, 2006, issued a Statement of\nReasons (SOR) to Applicant which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary\naffirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant\nor continue a security clearance for Applicant. DOHA recommended the case be referred to an\nadministrative judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or\nrevoked.\nOn March 29, 2007, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations and did not request a\nhearing. He later made a request for a hearing. The matter was assigned to me on August 21, 2007.\nA notice of hearing was issued on August 30, 2007, for a hearing on September 13, 2007, and held\nthat day. The government offered four exhibits and Applicant offered two exhibits. The record was\nleft open for 30 days and extended another 15 days for additional information to be supplied. The\ntranscript was received on September 24, 2007. Applicant provided post-hearing submissions on\nOctober 15, 2007, and October 29, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant admitted all of the eleven SOR allegations totaling $132,000 relating to delinquent\ndebts. After a complete review of the record, I make the following additional findings of fact:\nApplicant is a 32-year-old employee of a defense contractor working as a senior network\nengineer since October 2005.\nThe allegations alleged in the SOR indicates the following from testimony and documentary\nevidence submitted in the record:\n1. Par. 1.a.: Real estate mortgage foreclosure  before 2006 on a former home in another state\nvalued at $110,000. \n2. Par. 1.b.: Real estate second mortgage foreclosure of $12,700 regarding same home. \n3. Par. 1.c.: Credit card debt for household expenses of $6,285 charged off.\n4. Par. 1.d.: Credit card debt for $1,042 charged off. Applicant promised in his interrogatory\n(Exh. 2) to pay $50 per month but was unable to do so. \n5. Par. 1.e.: Credit card debt of $961.\n6. Par. 1.f.: Credit card debt of $362 charged off. \n7. Par. 1.g.: Credit card debt of $577 for household expenses being collected by a collection\nagency. \n\n3\n8. Par. 1.h.: Collection account of $495 for a medical device ordered by Applicant which he\nattempted to return but he held it too long. \n9. Par. 1.i.: Back child support totaling $800 for a six-year-old child from his former\nmarriage which is being paid through bi-weekly garnishment of wages when he is working.\nApplicant started having financial problems arising from a move from one state to another\nin June 2005 when he took his present position. He was unemployed and under-employed for periods\nbeginning in 2006 (Tr. 23). At the time of the hearing he had been on leave without pay since May\n2007 and had an hourly job at a store. Since then he has been brought back on the payroll with his\ncompany. He has never held a security clearance, but works for a company that primarily does\nclassified work. He is able to do unclassified work but it is often not full time. He is now on a project\nwhich lasts until August 2008 (Exh. D p. 2). His wife was unemployed in 2001 for approximately\n18 months after the birth of their child (Tr. 25) and did not return to work until 2003. In 2004 their\ndebts had accumulated to the point that they could not resolve them and stopped paying on them (Tr.\n25). She is now employed and her monthly take home pay is approximately $2,000. They have had\ncredit counseling and are working with the counselor to schedule payment of  their delinquent debts\nthat accumulated during the periods of unemployment (Exh. A). Most of this activity has occurred\nsince the hearing. In addition to the delinquent debts cited in the SOR, at the time of the hearing he\nwas behind one to two months on his current bills such as cell phone, utilities, and auto insurance\n(Tr. 34-36). \nSince the conclusion of the hearing, Applicant has submitted information in his first post-\nhearing submission (Exh. C) showing that he continues the credit counseling and is making direct\ndeposits of $169 each month to them to resolve the accounts listed in Exh. A. In his second post-\nhearing submission (Exh. D) he submitted further information indicating that he and his credit\ncounselor are working with the mortgage holders on the home foreclosure and some progress is\nbeing made to resolve those debts. He also submitted information from his employer showing that\nhis monthly take home pay is approximately $3,000 but he may earn as much as  $4,500. \nApplicant is well regarded in his company by his supervisor for his commitment to his job\nand his skills in performing them (Exh. B). \nPOLICIES\n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S.\n518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has \u201cthe authority to control access to\ninformation bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently\ntrustworthy to occupy a position that will give that person access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527.\nAn evaluation of whether the applicant meets the security guidelines includes consideration of the\nfollowing factors: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances\nsurrounding the conduct; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and\nmaturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) the\npresence or absence of rehabilitation and other behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the\nconduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of\ncontinuation or recurrence. Revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG \u00b6 2 a). Security clearances are\n\n4\ngranted only when \u201cit is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Executive Order No.\n10865 \u00a7 2. See Executive Order No. 12968 \u00a7 3.1(b).\nInitially, the Government must establish, by something less than a preponderance of the\nevidence, that conditions exist in the personal or professional history of the applicant which\ndisqualify, or may disqualify, the applicant from being eligible for access to classified information\nSee Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. The applicant then bears the burden of demonstrating it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance. \u201cAny doubt as to\nwhether access to classified information is clearly consistent with national security will be resolved\nin favor of the national security.\u201d (AG \u00b6 2 b) \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they\nmust, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. See Executive Order No. 12968 \u00a7 3.1(b).\nCONCLUSIONS\nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all appropriate\nadjudicative factors under the revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) and factors in the Directive, I\nconclude the following with respect to all allegations set forth in the SOR:\nApplicant\u2019s delinquent debts prompted the allegation of security concern under Guideline\nF because an individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts\nto generate funds (AG \u00b6 18). Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying\ninclude a history of not meeting financial obligations (AG \u00b6 19 c) and evidence of inability or\nunwillingness to satisfy debts. (AG \u00b6 19 a) \nMitigating Conditions (MC) that might apply include the fact that the behavior happened so\nlong ago or under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the\nindividual\u2019s current reliability , trustworthiness, or good judgment (AG \u00b6 20 a), or the conditions that\nresulted in the behavior were largely beyond the person\u2019s control and that the person acted\nresponsibly (AG \u00b6 20 b), or the person has received counseling for financial problems and there are\nclear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control (AG \u00b6 20 c).\nThe fact that Applicant was unemployed and underemployed for two years was partially the\ncause of his delinquent debts. His salary is being withheld to pay one creditor for child support but\nthat is the only delinquent debt that now is being resolved. He is working to resolve other debts and\nboth he and his wife are now employed which may resolve the delinquent debt issues for them.\nHowever, it is too soon to conclude that they are fully on the path to financial stability. Thus, I\nconclude that neither mitigating condition is applicable at this time. \nIn all adjudications, the protection of our national security is of paramount concern. Persons\nwho have access to classified information have an overriding responsibility for the security concerns\nof the nation. The objective of the security clearance process is the fair-minded, commonsense\nassessment of a person\u2019s trustworthiness and fitness for access to classified information. \nThe \u201cwhole person\u201d concept recognizes we should view a person by the totality of his acts\nand omissions. Each case must be judged on its own merits taking into consideration all relevant\n\n5\ncircumstances, and applying sound judgment, mature thinking, and careful analysis. Applicant did\nnot take action as soon as he might have. He acknowledged his slowness to take corrective action\nat the hearing. However, he seems now to be on the right track to effectively resolve the issues with\nthe help of their counselor. Although he has taken the appropriate initial steps to resolve the\ndelinquent debts, that process  is still in the early stages so it is premature to grant a clearance based\non the information submitted.  \nAfter considering all the evidence in its totality, and as an integrated whole to focus on the\nwhole person of Applicant, I conclude that it is premature to grant a security clearance.\nFORMAL FINDINGS \nFormal findings as required by the Directive are as follows:\nParagraph 1. Guideline F:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a.:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b.:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c.:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d.:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e.:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f.:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g.:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f.:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g.:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h.:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.i.:\nFor Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant a security clearance for Applicant.

Applicant and his wife own an apartment in Poland,\nand he receives monthly retirement benefits from the Polish government. Applicant failed to mitigate\nsecurity concerns under Guideline C, Foreign Preference.  Clearance is denied.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a security\nclearance for Applicant.  On December 11, 2006, under the applicable Executive Order  and\n1\nDepartment of Defense Directive,  DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis\n2\nfor its decision\u2013security concerns raised under Adjudicative Guideline C (Foreign Preference),\npromulgated December 29, 2005, and applicable in DoD adjudications of SORs issued as of\nSeptember 1, 2006, and thereafter.  With the SOR, DOHA provided Applicant with a copy of the\nDirective and the applicable Adjudicative Guideline.  Applicant executed a written response to the\nSOR on January 3, 2007.  He requested his case be determined on the record in lieu of a hearing.  The\nGovernment compiled its File of Relevant Material (FORM) on February 8, 2007.  The FORM\ncontained documents identified as Items 1 through 4. \nAn undated copy of the FORM was forwarded to Applicant, with instructions to submit any\nadditional information and/or objections within 30 days of receipt.  Applicant received the FORM on\nFebruary 22, 2007.  He submitted a four-page response to the FORM.  Applicant\u2019s response consisted\nof a three-page letter, dated March 23, 2007, which addressed specific information in the FORM and\noffered clarifying and mitigating information.  Applicant\u2019s response also included a photocopy of the\nfirst page of his Polish passport, issued December 2002, with an expiration date in December 2012.\nThe Government did not object to Applicant\u2019s submissions.  On April 2, 2007, the case was assigned\nto me for a decision.  After carefully reviewing the FORM and Applicant\u2019s submissions in response\nto the FORM, I marked the submissions as Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (Ex.) A and B and admitted them to\nthe record of this case.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant, who is currently 62 years old, is employed as a security officer by a defense\ncontractor.  He was born, raised, and educated in Poland.  Applicant and his wife were married in\nPoland in 1972, and they are the parents of two grown daughters.  Applicant immigrated to the U.S.\nfrom Poland in June 1997, and he became a naturalized U.S. citizen in October 2004.  He acquired a\nU.S. passport on January 7, 2005.  Applicant\u2019s wife and daughters are also naturalized U.S. citizens.\n\n As an attachment to his Answer to the SOR, Applicant supplied two pages of an untranslated Polish document,\n3\ndated March 1, 2006, which he annotated in English, showing the amount of his monthly retirement allotment, before\nand after deductions for taxes to the Polish government. \n3\nApplicant, his wife, and their daughters claim dual citizenship with Poland and the U.S.  (Item 3; Item\n4; Applicant\u2019s Answer to SOR at 2.)  \nApplicant holds a bachelor of arts diploma from a teacher\u2019s college in Poland, and he holds a\nMaster of Arts degree from a Polish university.  He worked for 31 years as a teacher in Poland, and\nduring that time, money was deducted from his salary for participation in the government retirement\nsystem.  Applicant now receives a retirement pension from the government of Poland.  Each month,\nthe Polish government subtracts taxes due and then deposits approximately 1,142.34 PLN (Polish\nZloty) in Applicant\u2019s bank account in Poland.  Applicant estimates his monthly pension equals about\n$393.62 (USD) .  \n3\nDuring his time as a teacher in Poland, Applicant and his wife lived as tenants in special state-\nsubsidized housing for teachers.  In about 2000 or 2001, they purchased the apartment they had been\noccupying from the Polish government for about $2,000.  Applicant\u2019s wife is identified as the record\nowner of the apartment, although Applicant also acknowledges ownership.  Applicant and his wife\nstay in the apartment when they travel to Poland to visit relatives.  They are considering selling the\napartment since they do not intend to live in Poland anymore.  (Item 3; Item 4 at 6; Answer to FORM\nat 2.)   \nIn 2002, Applicant was a permanent U.S. resident living in the U.S.  He acquired a Polish\npassport and used it to travel to Poland.  In May 2005, after becoming a U.S. citizen and acquiring a\nU.S. passport, Applicant used his Polish passport to enter Poland.  He stated he relied on official\ninformation from the U.S. Department of State and from the government of Poland which stated that\nindividuals exercising dual citizenship with Poland and the U.S. must enter and depart Poland with\na Polish passport and enter and depart the U.S. on a U.S. passport.  (See Applicant\u2019s attachments to\nItem 3: Http://warsaw.usembassy.gov/poland/dualnationality -408cda12d248a.html; Polish Business\nDirectory USA 2006, at 61-62.)  The record fails to show that Applicant has expressed a willingness\nto renounce dual citizenship.  The Government did not submit any official U.S. documents containing\nfacts about Poland for administrative notice.\nPOLICIES\n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d  Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518,\n528 (1988).  As Commander in Chief, the President has \u201cthe authority to . . . control access to\ninformation bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently\ntrustworthy to occupy a position . . . that will give that person access to such information.\u201d  Id. at 527.\nThe President has restricted eligibility for access to classified information to United States citizens\n\u201cwhose personal and professional history affirmatively indicates loyalty to the United States, strength\nof character, trustworthiness, honesty, reliability, discretion, and sound judgment, as well as freedom\nfrom conflicting allegiances and potential for coercion, and willingness and ability to abide by\nregulations governing the use, handling, and protection of classified information.\u201d  Exec. Or. 12968,\n\nDOHA alleged that Applicant\u2019s Polish passport will not expire until \u201capproximately 2014.\u201d  Applicant provided\n4\na photocopy of the first page of his current Polish passport showing its expiration date as \u201cDecember 13, 2012.\u201d  (Ex.\nB.)\n4\nAccess to Classified Information \u00a7 3.1(b) (Aug. 2, 1995).  Eligibility for a security clearance is\npredicated upon the applicant meeting the security guidelines contained in the Directive.\nBy Memorandum dated August 30, 2006, the Under Secretary of Defense directed\nimplementation of revised Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified\nInformation (AG), promulgated December 29, 2005, and effective September 1, 2006, as modified.\nThe revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) replaced the guidelines published in Enclosure 2 to DoD\nDirective 5220.6 and Appendix 8 to DoD 5200.2-R, and they apply to all adjudications and other\ndeterminations in which a SOR had not been issued by September 1, 2006.  Accordingly, since the\nSOR in this case was issued December 11, 2006, the revised AG apply.\nThe revised AG set forth personal security guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions\nand mitigating conditions under each guideline.  In evaluating the security worthiness of an applicant,\nthe administrative judge must also assess the adjudicative process factors listed in \u00b6 6.3 of the\nDirective.  The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a determination\nas to the loyalty of the applicant.  See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7.  It is merely an indication that the applicant\nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing\na security clearance.\nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the personal\nor professional history of the applicant that disqualify, or may disqualify, the applicant from being\neligible for access to classified information.  See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  The Directive presumes a\nnexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the disqualifying conditions listed\nin the guidelines and an applicant\u2019s security suitability.  See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 (App. Bd.\nMay 2, 1996).  \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial evidence, the burden\nshifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts.  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at\n3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002); see Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of\ndemonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security\nclearance.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3.\nCONCLUSIONS\nGuideline C - Foreign Preference\nIn the SOR, DOHA alleged, and Applicant admitted, that he exercised dual citizenship with\nPoland and the United States (\u00b6 1.a.); that he had an active Polish passport renewed in approximately\n2004 (\u00b6 1.b.) ; that he receives a monthly pension from the Polish government, which is deposited into\n4\n\nDOHA alleged Applicant\u2019s monthly pension was worth approximately $200 USD.  Applicant provided a\n5\nuntranslated document in Polish which he said calculated his most current monthly pension amount in Polish zloty.\nUsing current information on the exchange rate for zloty and US dollars, Applicant stated his monthly pension, paid to\nhim in zloty, equals $393.62 USD.  (Item 3.)\n5\nhis Polish bank account (\u00b6 1.c.) ; that, in about 2000 or 2001, he purchased an apartment in Poland,\n5\nsubsidized by the Polish government, for approximately $2,000 (\u00b6 1.d.); and that he used his Polish\npassport to enter Poland in about May 2005, despite having an active U.S. passport issued to him in\nJanuary 2005 (\u00b6 1.e.).\nA Guideline C security concern exists when an individual\u2019s conduct indicates a preference for\na foreign country over the United States.  A preference for another country could lead a person to\nprovide information or make decisions that are harmful to the interests of the United States. (AG  C,\n\u00b6 9.)\nUnder AG  C, a disqualifying security concern may be raised when an individual exercises\nany right, privilege or obligation of foreign citizenship after becoming a U.S. citizen or through the\nforeign citizenship of a family member. (AG  C, \u00b6 10(a).)  A potentially disqualifying security concern\nis also raised under AG  C, \u00b6 10(b) when an American citizen takes action to acquire or obtain\nrecognition of a foreign citizenship.  The facts of this case raise four potentially disqualifying\nconditions of security concern: possession of a current foreign passport; accepting educational,\nmedical, retirement, social welfare, or other such benefits from a foreign country; using foreign\ncitizenship to protect financial or business interests in another country; and action to acquire or obtain\nrecognition of a foreign citizenship by an American citizen. (AG  C, \u00b6\u00b6 10(a)(1), 10(a)(3), 10(a) (5),\nand 10(b).\nApplicant claims and exercises dual citizenship with Poland and the United States.  He\npossesses a current Polish passport, which he used, in preference to the active U.S. passport he also\npossesses, to enter and exit Poland in May 2005.  His possession and use of his Polish passport\ninvolves the exercise of rights and privileges of foreign citizenship, which raises a potentially\ndisqualifying security concern under AG  C,\u00b6 10 (a) and \u00b6 10(a)(1).  See ISCR Case No. 00-0489 at\n11-12 (App. Bd. Jan. 10, 2002).  In 2005, he presented his Polish passport upon entry to Poland in\ncompliance with Polish law relating to dual citizenship, raising a potentially disqualifying security\nconcern under AG  C \u00b6 10(b).  Applicant also accepts retirement benefits, deposited into his bank\naccount in Poland, from the government of Poland, and he owns an apartment he acquired for about\n$2,000 by reason of his former status as a teacher in Poland, raising a potentially disqualifying security\nconcern under AG C, \u00b6 10(a)(3).  The record is silent regarding Applicant\u2019s eligibility for his pension\nand his eligibility to retain the apartment should he not claim dual citizenship with Poland, and there\nare insufficient facts in the record to conclude Applicant is using his foreign citizenship to protect\nfinancial or business interests in Poland.  (See AG  C,\u00b6 10(a)(5).) \nThere are several applicable conditions that could mitigate the security concerns identified and\ndiscussed above.  Applicant could mitigate security concerns about his dual citizenship if his dual\ncitizenship is based solely on his parents\u2019 citizenship or on his birth in a foreign country and if he has\nexpressed a willingness to renounce his dual citizenship.  (Guideline C, \u00b6 \u00b6 11(a) and 11(b).)  The\nrecord shows Applicant\u2019s dual citizenship is based on his birth in a foreign country.  Thus, mitigating\n\n6\ncondition AG  C\u00b6 11(a) applies.  Because Applicant has not expressed a willingness to renounce his\ndual citizenship, mitigating condition AG  C\u00b6 11(b) does not apply.\nAn applicant might mitigate the exercise of any right, privilege or obligation of foreign\ncitizenship after becoming a U.S. citizen or through the foreign citizenship of a family member if the\nright, privilege or obligation of foreign citizenship occurred before the individual became a U.S.\ncitizen or when the individual was a minor. (AG  C, \u00b6 11(c).  Applicant used his Polish passport to\nenter Poland after becoming a U.S. citizen and while in possession of a valid U.S. passport.  In doing\nso, he exercised a right or privilege or obligation of foreign citizenship after becoming a U.S. citizen.\nThe possession and use of a foreign passport in preference to a U.S. passport raises doubt as to whether\nthe person\u2019s allegiance to the United States is paramount, and it could also facilitate foreign travel\nunverifiable by the United States.  Nothing in the record indicates Applicant has received approval\nfrom a cognizant U.S. security authority for the use of his foreign passport.  Nothing in the record\nsupports a conclusion that Applicant\u2019s passport has been destroyed, surrendered to the cognizant U.S.\nsecurity authority, or has been otherwise invalidated.  Accordingly, I conclude that the mitigating\nconditions at AG  C, \u00b6\u00b6 11(c). 11(d) and 11(e) are inapplicable.\nThe record is unclear whether Applicant received retirement benefits from the Polish\ngovernment before becoming a U.S. citizen.  However, as a U.S. citizen, he currently receives them\nmonthly from the Polish government, and his dependency upon a foreign government for distribution\nof benefits earned could create a security concern and remains unmitigated.  Additionally, his\nownership of property in Poland as an individual actively exercising dual citizenship also remains\nunmitigated.\nWhole Person Analysis\nThe Directive requires that the adjudicative process in a security clearance case not only assess\nconduct under the adjudicative guidelines, but it must also reflect a careful weighing of a number of\nvariables known as the whole person concept.  The factors to be considered in a whole person analysis\ninclude the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; the circumstances surrounding the conduct,\nto include knowledgeable participation; the frequency and recency of the conduct; the individual\u2019s age\nand maturity at the time of the conduct;  the extent to which participation is voluntary; the presence\nor absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; the motivation for the conduct; the\npotential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and, the likelihood for continuation or\nrecurrence.\nApplicant is a mature adult who presents a record of industriousness and hard work.  Nothing\nin the record suggests he is not a loyal American citizen.  However, his possession of an active Polish\npassport and his exercise of dual citizenship with Poland and the U.S. raise doubts and serious security\nconcerns because Applicant\u2019s choices could indicate a preference for Poland over the United States.\nAn individual entrusted with a security clearance must unequivocally put the interests of the U.S.\nbefore those of any other country.  By exercising a preference for Poland, Applicant might be disposed\nto provide information or to make decisions that are harmful to the U.S.  \u201cAny doubt as to whether\naccess to classified information is clearly consistent with national security will be resolved in favor\nof the national security.\u201d  Directive,\u00b6 E2.2.2.\n\n7\nIn all security clearance adjudications, the protection of our national security is the paramount\nconcern.  Security clearance decisions are not intended to assign guilt or to impose further punishment\nfor past transgressions.  Rather, the objective of the security clearance process is the fair-minded,\ncommon sense assessment of a person\u2019s trustworthiness and fitness for access to classified\ninformation.  Indeed, the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept recognizes we should view a person by the totality\nof his or her acts and omissions, including all disqualifying and mitigating conduct.  Having done so,\nI conclude Applicant should not be entrusted with a security clearance.  In reaching my decision, I have\nconsidered the evidence as a whole, including the appropriate factors and guidelines in Department\nof Defense Directive, 5220.6., as amended.  Accordingly, allegations 1.a. through 1.e. are concluded\nagainst Applicant.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nThe following are my conclusions as to each allegation in the SOR:\nParagraph 1.: Guideline C:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a.:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b.:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c.:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d.:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e.:\nAgainst Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.

As required by Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 \u00b6 E2.1.2\n(Jan. 2, 1992) as amended, DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) on January 30, 2007,\ndetailing the basis for its decision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline C (foreign preference)\nand Guideline B (foreign influence) of the revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) issued on\nDecember 29, 2005, and implemented by the Department of Defense effective September 1, 2006.\nThe revised guidelines were provided to Applicant when the SOR was issued.1\nOn February 16, 2007, Applicant responded to the SOR and requested a decision based on\nthe written record without a hearing. The government submitted a File of Relevant Material (FORM)\non March 12, 2007, consisting of four exhibits (Ex. 1-4). Department Counsel also requested that\nI take administrative notice of certain facts, and submitted 12 documents to support the request,\nidentified in the FORM as I through XII. DOHA forwarded a copy of the FORM to Applicant and\ninstructed him to respond within 30 days of receipt. Applicant filed a timely rebuttal dated March\n27, 2007. On review on April 2, 2007, Department Counsel had no objections to Applicant\u2019s\nsubmission. The case was assigned to me on May 2, 2007, to determine whether it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.\nRULINGS ON PROCEDURE\nIn the FORM, the government requested the administrative judge take administrative notice\nof several facts concerning Taiwan and the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC or China). Authority\nto consider the government\u2019s request is set forth in \u00b6 E3.1.10 of Department of Defense Directive\n5220.6 (The Administrative Judge may rule on questions of procedure, discovery, and evidence and\nshall conduct all proceedings in a fair, timely, and orderly manner.). The DOHA Appeal Board has\nruled that administrative or official notice in administrative proceedings is broader than judicial\nnotice under the Federal Rules of Evidence. In ISCR Case No. 02-24875 (decided Oct. 12, 2006),\n\nSee Background Note: Taiwan, dated October 2006 (I), Background Note: China, dated April 2006 (VIII),\n2\nChina: Country Reports on Human Rights Practices-2005, dated March 8, 2006 (IX), and Consular Information Sheet\non China, dated September 22, 2006 (XII).\nSee Taiwan: Recent Developments and U.S. Policy Choices, dated October 9, 2006 (II).\n3\nSee Intelligence Threat Handbook, excerpts, dated June 2004 (IV). The document was prepared for the\n4\nInteragency OPSEC Support Staff by the Center for Counterintelligence and Security Studies, a private contractor.\nSee Annual Report to Congress on Foreign Economic Collection and Industrial Espionage, 2000 (VII, page\n5\n15 missing from the file copy provided for review) and Annual Report to Congress on Foreign Economic Collection and\nIndustrial Espionage, 2005 (XI). \nSee U.S. National Security and Military/Commercial Concerns with the People\u2019s Republic of China,\n6\ndeclassified version dated January 3, 1999 (X).\n3\nthe Appeal Board found no error in a DOHA administrative judge taking administrative notice of\na U.S. State Department Country Reports on Human Rights 2000: Laos, as the document was an\nofficial U.S. government report relevant to the issues in the case before him, and it was provided in\nadvance to the applicant who had an opportunity to rebut its contents or to present alternative\ninformation for the judge to notice.\nApplicant filed no objection to the proposed facts for administrative notice, but this does not\nrelieve me of the responsibility to determine whether the proposed facts are proper for administrative\nnotice in this case, i.e., easily verifiable by an authorized source and relevant and material to the case\nbefore me. Concerning the source documentation, the government relied on publications of the\nDepartment of State;  the Congressional Research Service;  the Centre for Counterintelligence and\n2\n3\nSecurity Studies;  the National Counterintelligence Center, now known as the Office of the National\n4\nCounterintelligence Executive;  and a Select Committee of the United States House of\n5\nRepresentatives;  two press releases reportedly from the U.S. Department of Justice; and records of\n6\nthe U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia. However, source document V, identified\nas a press release of the U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia and dated January 22,\n2007, was not included in the file sent to me for consideration. The only press release included was\nfrom the U.S. Attorney for the Western District of New York (IV), which has not been demonstrated\nto be relevant to Applicant. Moreover, the U.S. District Court document (VI) included in the file is\na criminal complaint with attached Affidavit in Support of Criminal Complaint and Arrest Warrant,\nfiled September 15, 2004. It was improperly identified in the FORM as a \u201cStatement of Facts,\u201d dated\nDecember 12, 2005, filed with the District Court. Noting that a criminal complaint is a statement of\ncharges and not proof of any misconduct, it also did not pertain to any criminal charge brought\nagainst Applicant. In response to the government\u2019s request, I took administrative notice of certain\nfacts as set out below.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nDOHA alleged under Guideline C, foreign preference, that Applicant exercised dual\ncitizenship with the U.S. and Taiwan (SOR \u00b6 1.a), and as a U.S. naturalized citizen acquired a\nTaiwanese passport in November 2005 (\u00b6 1.c) that was valid as of August 2006 (\u00b6 1.b). Foreign\n\nBased on the date of birth listed on his SF 86, Applicant was two months shy of his 39  birthday. (See Ex. 4).\n7\nth\nThe date(s) on which Applicant and his family first came to the U.S. is not of record. Applicant indicated in\n8\nresponse to the FORM that his only in-person contact with his grandmother was during the two weeks in November 2005\n\u201cafter been to United State [sic] for 20 some years.\u201d\n4\ninfluence (Guideline B) concerns were alleged related to the Taiwanese citizenship and residency\nof his grandmother (\u00b6 2.a) and his travel to Taiwan in November 2005 (\u00b6 2.b).\nIn his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the allegations, but explained that he acquired\nhis Taiwanese passport so that he could have \u201cOverseas Chinese\u201d status and would not be drafted\ninto compulsory military service on his return to Taiwan to visit his 80-year-old grandmother in\nNovember 2005. Told at the time that he was ineligible to renounce his Taiwanese citizenship before\nage 40, Applicant expressed his willingness to surrender his passport and Taiwanese citizenship\nsince he was now \u201conly a year away from 40 years old.\u201d  \n7\nAfter a thorough review of the documents before me for consideration, including Applicant\u2019s\nrebuttal to the FORM, and having agreed to take administrative notice, I make the following relevant\nand material findings of fact:\nApplicant is a 39-year-old structural engineer. He earned his master of science degree from\na public university in the U.S. in about December 1999. Applicant has been employed by a defense\ncontractor since January 1997 and seeks a security clearance for his duties.\nApplicant\u2019s background and foreign ties\nApplicant and his immediate family (parents and two siblings) emigrated from their native\nTaiwan to the U.S. in the early to mid-1980's.  His parents and brother became U.S. citizens in 1989,\n8\nand his sister in 1992. In September 1986, at age 18, Applicant began college in the U.S. In June\n1990, he took the oath of U.S. naturalization, vowing to renounce all foreign allegiances, to support\nand defend the U.S. Constitution and its laws, and to bear arms or perform noncombatant service or\ncivilian service on behalf of the U.S. if required. Applicant assumed that his acquisition of U.S.\ncitizenship operated to automatically revoke his Taiwanese citizenship.\nPlanning a trip to Taiwan to see his ill 80-year-old grandmother in November 1995,\nApplicant checked the U.S. Department of State website for information about travel to Taiwan. He\nwas \u201cshocked\u201d to learn that under Taiwan\u2019s law providing for compulsory military service, men\nbetween the ages of 18 and 40 born in Taiwan or who have ever held a Taiwanese passport may be\nsubjected to compulsory military service in Taiwan, even if they are also U.S. citizens and even if\nthey have entered Taiwan on U.S. passports. Potentially affected persons were urged to consult with\nthe nearest office of the Taipei Economic and Cultural Office (TECO) before visiting Taiwan to\ndetermine whether they were subjected to that requirement.\nApplicant contacted the TECO and explained that he had renounced his Taiwanese\ncitizenship when he became a U.S. citizen in 1990. He was informed that under Taiwanese law he\nwas still a citizen of Taiwan and ineligible to renounce his Taiwanese citizenship until after age 40.\nHe was led to understand that if he returned to Taiwan, he would be liable for compulsory military\n\nIt is not clear whether Applicant obtained that Taiwanese passport when he was in Taiwan visiting his\n9\ngrandmother or just shortly before his trip. It was issued that same month of his trip, and he indicated in response to the\nFORM that he never traveled on that passport. It does not indicate on his SF 86 (Ex. 4) whether he has or had a U.S.\npassport. If he did not have a U.S. passport, then he would have needed his foreign passport to exit and re-enter the U.S.\n5\nservice unless he fell within an exception for those with \u201cOverseas Chinese\u201d status who departed\nTaiwan before age 15 and never returned for a visit of more than four months and the total of visits\ndid not exceed a year. To ensure that he would not be drafted into the Taiwanese military when in\nTaiwan to visit his grandmother, Applicant acquired a Taiwanese passport in about November 2005\nto convert to \u201cOverseas Chinese\u201d status. He visited his grandmother in Taiwan for two weeks in\nNovember 2005.9\nOn April 3, 2006, Applicant executed a Questionnaire for Sensitive Positions (SF 86). He\ndisclosed that he, his parents, and his siblings, had all acquired U.S. citizenship, but that he had\nobtained a Taiwanese passport in November 2005 to convert to overseas Taiwanese status. He also\nreported his pleasure trip to Taiwan in November 2005.\nOn August 22, 2006, Applicant was interviewed by an investigator for the Department of\nDefense. He acknowledged his possession of a valid Taiwanese passport issued in November 2005.\nOn receipt of the SOR in February 2007, Applicant learned that his exercise of Taiwanese\ncitizenship, and application for, and possession of, a Taiwanese passport, raised concerns of foreign\npreference. With the understanding that he had to be at least age 40 to renounce his Taiwanese\ncitizenship, Applicant expressed a willingness to surrender his passport and renounce his foreign\ncitizenship as he was \u201conly a year away from 40 years old.\u201d He questioned the foreign influence\nimplications raised by his travel to Taiwan to see his grandmother in November 2005, and averred\nthat it was not by his choice that she lives in Taiwan.\nIn response to the FORM, Applicant notified DOHA that he had turned over his Taiwanese\npassport to his employer\u2019s facility security officer. The passport was shredded on March 27, 2007,\nas confirmed by the FSO in a letter of that date. Since his immigration to the U.S., Applicant\u2019s in-\nperson contact with his grandmother has been limited to that visit to Taiwan in November 2005.\nI take administrative notice of the following adjudicative facts. The government of Taiwan\nis a multi-party democracy. The United States recognizes that there is only one China, that the\ngovernment of the People\u2019s Republic of China is the sole legal government of China, and that\nTaiwan is part of China. Nonetheless, under the Taiwan Relations Act of 1979, the U.S. conducts\nunofficial relations with Taiwan. Although the U.S. terminated its Mutual Defense Treaty, it has\ncontinued to sell appropriate military defensive material to Taiwan. It is U.S. policy that the\nresolution of disputes between Taiwan and China be peaceful. Taiwan is a major international\ntrading power and a member of the World Trade Organization. It enjoys normal trade relations with\nthe U.S., and ready access to U.S. markets. The U.S. State Department reports that Taiwan has taken\ndramatic steps to improve respect for human rights and create a democratic political system since\nending martial law. In the past, organizations in Taiwan employed unlawful methods to obtain U.S.\neconomic and intelligence information. \nPOLICIES\n\nThe term of his Taiwanese passport is not of record. Given its recent issuance in November 2005, it was likely\n10\nstill valid until its destruction in March 2007.\n6\n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S.\n518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has \u201cthe authority to . . . control access to\ninformation bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently\ntrustworthy to occupy a position . . . that will give that person access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527.\nThe President authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants eligibility for\naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb.\n20, 1960). An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with\nthe national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App.\nBd. Dec. 19, 2002).\nThe adjudicative guidelines set forth potentially disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating\nconditions (MC) under each guideline. In evaluating the security worthiness of an applicant, the\nadministrative judge must also assess the adjudicative process factors listed in \u00b6 6.3 of the Directive.\nThe decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a determination as to the\nloyalty of the applicant. See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met\nthe strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a\nclearance.\nCONCLUSIONS\nGuideline C\u2014Foreign Preference\nWhen an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a foreign country over\nthe United States, then he or she may be prone to provide information or make decisions that are\nharmful to the interests of the United States. (AG \u00b6 9). A native of Taiwan, Applicant immigrated\nto the U.S. with his immediate family when he was still a minor. He became a U.S. citizen when he\nwas in college, and assumed at that time that he was no longer a Taiwanese citizen. Shocked to learn\nthat he not only was still a Taiwanese citizen but that he could be conscripted into military service\nif he went to Taiwan, Applicant acquired a Taiwanese passport to convert to \u201cOverseas Chinese\u201d\nstatus so that he could visit his ill grandmother without fear of being forced to remain in Taiwan to\nfulfill compulsory military service.  His voluntary acquisition of a Taiwanese passport is the exercise\nof a privilege of his Taiwanese citizenship after becoming a U.S. citizen and it raises serious foreign\npreference concerns under AG \u00b6 10 (a)(1), exercise of any right, privilege or obligation of foreign\ncitizenship after becoming a U.S. citizen or through the foreign citizenship of a family member. This\nincludes but is not limited to: (1) possession of a current foreign passport.\n \nIn mitigation of the foreign preference concerns raised by possession of a current foreign\npassport,  Applicant turned in his passport to his employer\u2019s FSO and it has been shredded. His\n10\ngood faith effort to comply with DoD requirements satisfies mitigating condition \u00b6 11(e), the\npassport has been destroyed, surrendered to the cognizant security authority, or otherwise\ninvalidated. However, his destruction of this Taiwanese passport, done without the approval or\napparent knowledge of Taiwanese authorities, is not sufficient to revoke his dual citizenship. As long\nas Applicant remains a Taiwanese citizen, he presumably can reapply for a passport. Applicant is not\n\nApplicant indicated he must be at least 40 years old to formally renounce. According to a March 2001\n11\ncompilation of citizenship laws by the U.S. Office of Personnel Management Investigations Service titled Citizenship\nLaws of the World, Taiwan does not recognize dual citizenship. Voluntary renunciation of Taiwanese citizenship is\npermitted for any persons over the age of 20 except for persons of military age who have not yet performed their service,\npersons who are in active military service, and persons who hold military or civilian office.\n7\nlikely to do so, however. With the exception of his acquisition of the Taiwanese passport to convert\nto \u201cOverseas Chinese\u201d status, Applicant has not exercised any right, privilege, or obligation of his\nforeign citizenship as an adult. Indeed, he thought he was no longer a citizen of Taiwan after his\nnaturalization in the U.S. in 1990. It was only because of the operation of Taiwanese law, over which\nhe had no control, that he remained a Taiwanese citizen (see \u00b6 11(a) dual citizenship is based solely\non parents\u2019 citizenship or birth in a foreign country). He was unaware of his status as a dual citizen\nuntil he contacted the TECO in reliance on published advice of the U.S. State Department that he\ncould be subjected to compulsory military service in Taiwan even as a U.S. citizen traveling on a\nU.S. passport. His subsequent acquisition of his Taiwanese passport was not intended as an act of\npreference for Taiwan, but rather to make himself eligible for an exemption from compulsory\nmilitary service available to those \u201cOverseas Chinese\u201d who departed Taiwan before age 15 and never\nreturned for a visit of more than four months and all visits totaled not more than one year. After\nbeing given the adjudicative guidelines making clear that his foreign citizenship was a security issue,\nApplicant indicated, \u201cI\u2019m willing to surrendering [sic] my passport and renounce my Taiwan\nCitizenship since I\u2019m only a year away from 40 years old.\u201d (See Answer). Willingness to renounce\ndual citizenship is potentially mitigating under \u00b6 11(b), the individual has expressed a willingness\nto renounce dual citizenship. His failure to formally file as of late March 2007 is credibly explained\nby him being currently ineligible for renunciation to be granted.  His destruction of his foreign\n11\npassport is consistent with his U.S. citizenship and telling of his preference for the U.S.\nGuideline B\u2014Foreign Influence\nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual has divided\nloyalties, or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or induced to help a foreign person,\ngroup, organization, or government that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or\ncoercion by any foreign interest. Adjudication under this Guideline can and should consider the\nidentity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or financial interest is located, including,\nbut not limited to, such considerations as to whether the foreign country is known to target United\nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a risk of terrorism. (AG \u00b6\n6). Applicant\u2019s elderly grandmother is a resident citizen of Taiwan. Under AG \u00b6 7(a), foreign\ninfluence concerns are raised by contact with a foreign family member, business or professional\nassociate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a foreign country if that contact\ncreates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure or coercion.\nAlthough Applicant chose not to cancel his trip to Taiwan to see his grandmother when he learned\nhe would have to obtain a Taiwanese passport to avoid possible conscription into the Taiwanese\nmilitary during his visit, he described his contacts with her as infrequent. Their in-person contact has\nbeen limited to a brief two-week period in the past 20 some years. The limited contact does not\nsuggest an especially close relationship. Not enough is known about his elderly grandmother\u2019s\nactivities from which one could conclude that there is or is not a heightened risk because of her\nposition or activities.\n\nContrary to the government\u2019s assertion, in the file copy of  the  National Counterintelligence Center\u2019s Annual\n12\nReport to Congress on Foreign Economic Collection and Industrial Espionage\u20132005 (XI), which is missing page 15,\nthere is no list of countries known to aggressively target U.S. economic or intelligence information. In the 2005 report,\nthe PRC and Russia are the only countries listed by name as the most active collectors.\nIn the FORM, Department Counsel did not expound as to the nature of the \u201cheightened risk\u201d presented by the\n13\nPRC other than to state, \u201cThe facts detailed above in the administrative notice section and those more detailed facts in\nthe administrative notice source documents demonstrate this heightened risk.\u201d Among the facts proposed for\nadministrative notice are that China has a poor record with respect to human rights, and that those traveling to China may\nat times be placed under surveillance by PRC security personnel. Yet, there is no evidence that Applicant has ever been\nto the PRC, or that he has any tie or connection to the PRC.\nSee U.S. State Department\u2019s Background Note: Taiwan (I).\n14\n8\nThe country involved is a relevant consideration, and the government argues for a heightened\nrisk because of Taiwan, a country whose inhabitants share ethnicity and increasing economic ties\nwith the PRC, and one which is an active collector of U.S. economic and proprietary information.12\nConcerns of Taiwan targeting U.S. economic and proprietary interests are counterbalanced by\nTaiwan\u2019s partnership in defense with the U.S. and Taiwan\u2019s progress in achieving democratic\nelections, civil liberties, and stable, viable governmental institutions. As reported by the U.S. State\nDepartment, Taiwan has taken dramatic steps to improve respect for human rights and create a\ndemocratic political system. Taiwan also has a history of favorable relations with the U.S. While the\nU.S. does not support independence for Taiwan and is committed to a \u201cone-China\u201d policy, under the\nTaiwan Relations Act, signed into law on April 10, 1979, the U.S. is obligated to help Taiwan defend\nitself, including making available defensive arms and defensive services to Taiwan. U.S. commercial\nties with Taiwan have been maintained and expanded since 1979, and Taiwan is not likely to\njeopardize its relationship with the U.S. by overly pressuring its citizens, but even nations with a\nhistory of friendly relations do not always have the same interests. \nAs for the government\u2019s concerns that ties between Taiwan and the PRC heighten the risk\nof undue foreign influence,  although Taiwan and the PRC have increased their economic ties, they\n13\nare not closely aligned politically, and are diametrically opposed in several aspects. The current\nTaiwanese government has a pro-independence bias. The PRC is seen as the predominant threat by\nTaiwan, and its military\u2019s primary mission is to defend against the PRC.  As noted by Department\n14\nCounsel in the FORM, Taiwan\u2019s own national security remains under constant threat from the PRC.\nAssuming the PRC is engaged in active intelligence gathering against Taiwan within Taiwan\u2019s\nborders, there is no evidence that Applicant\u2019s grandmother is in a position where she is likely to be\ntargeted by the PRC, or by Taiwan for that matter. Mitigating condition \u00b6 8(a) applies where the\nnature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which these persons are located, or\nthe positions or activities of those persons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual\nwill be placed in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, group,\norganization, or government and the interests of the U.S.\nIn the unlikely event that Applicant found himself in a position of being forced to choose\nbetween the interests of his grandmother or Taiwan and the interests of the U.S., Applicant can be\nexpected to resolve those interests in favor of the U.S., where he has been exposed to educational,\ncultural, and peer influences since he was a teenager. Applicant made an affirmative choice in 1990\nto acquire U.S. citizenship under a belief (albeit mistaken) that it meant renunciation of his\nTaiwanese citizenship. His ten years of contributions as a defense contractor employee and his\n\n9\nefforts to avoid conscription in the Taiwanese military are objective indicators of his bonds to the\nU.S., while his expressed willingness to renounce his Taiwanese citizenship reflects the minimal\nnature of his emotional tie to Taiwan. Applicant satisfies MC \u00b6 8(b),  there is no conflict of interest,\neither because the individual\u2019s sense of loyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group,\ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding\nrelationships and loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any conflict of\ninterest in favor of the U.S. interest.\nWhole Person Concept\nThe adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make\nan affirmative determination that the person is eligible for a security clearance. (AG \u00b6 2(a)).\nApplicant\u2019s voluntary exercise of his Taiwanese citizenship some 15 years after he had acquired U.S.\ncitizenship would ordinarily raise very serious concern about whether he can be counted on to serve\nU.S. interests (\u00b6 2(a)(1), the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct). However, his motive\nwas to ensure that he did not have to fulfill military service for Taiwan (\u00b6 2(a)(7), the motivation for\nthe conduct), and he has demonstrated reform in complying with DoD requirements to surrender,\ndestroy, or otherwise invalidate his Taiwanese passport (\u00b6 2(a)(6), the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes). His only ties to Taiwan are a citizenship\nstatus by operation of law rather than choice, and an elderly grandmother, with whom he has had\nlimited in-person contact. His substantial ties to the U.S. (citizenship for 17 years, residency for more\nthan 20 years, career) overwhelm those to his native Taiwan such that he can be counted on to fulfill\nhis fiduciary obligations to the United States.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nThe following are my conclusions as to each allegation in the SOR:\nParagraph 1.

Applicant answered the SOR in writing on\nMay 8, 2007, and elected to have a hearing before an administrative judge.  The case was assigned\nto me on June 27, 2007.  On September 21, 2007, I convened a hearing to consider whether it is\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.\nThe Government and the Applicant submitted exhibits that were admitted into evidence.  DOHA\nreceived the hearing transcript (Tr.) on October 4, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant's admissions to the SOR allegations are incorporated here as findings of fact.  After\na complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and full consideration of that\nevidence, I make the following additional findings of fact:\nApplicant is 28 years old, a naturalized U.S. citizen, and unmarried.  He works for a defense\ncontractor in the aerospace business, but currently is on leave to study for his doctorate degree in\naerospace engineering.  He obtained dual bachelor's degrees in aerospace engineering and\natmospheric, oceanic, and space sciences.  Later, he obtained his master's degree in aerospace\nengineering.  Applicant came to the United States with his parents when he was five years old.\nWhen he was in fourth grade, his parents and he became U.S. citizens.  His sister was born in the\nUnited States. (Tr. 17, 21, 28, 31, 32; Answer; Exhibits 1, C, G)\nApplicant's mother and sister live in the United States.  His sister has a master's degree.  His\nmother lives at home and does volunteer work.  His father works overseas in the Peoples Republic\nof China (PRC), traveling on his U.S. passport only, and works for a Taiwanese company making\nautomobile interior parts as the manager of the mainland China plant.  Applicant telephones his\nfather monthly to speak with him.  His father will retire in a few years and return to live in the family\nhome he and his wife have owned in the United States for the past 20 years. (Tr. 15, 22, 23, 26-28,\n32; Answer; Exhibits 1, B)\nApplicant and his family returned to live on Taiwan when Applicant was in the seventh\ngrade.  His father had a management job with an American company there.  On Taiwan he attended\nan American high school.  He returned to the United States to attend college in 1997.  He graduated\nfrom his five-year program in 2002.  His family returned to live in the United States in 2000 when\nhis sister started college.  Applicant went to Taiwan for a summer internship in 2000 at a prestigious\nresearch institute, then returned to the United States for the college the fall semester.  He exchanges\n\n3\none annual email message with his supervisor from that summer institute program. (Tr. 18-21, 24;\nAnswer)\nApplicant went to Taiwan in the summer of 2002 to visit his grandmother and aunt.  His\nfamily traveled with him.  He telephones his grandmother twice a year.  He also traveled to the PRC\nto visit his father and make tourist visits in the PRC because he had never been there previously.  He\ncontacted his employer's security office before going to Taiwan and China to determine what he\nshould or should not do while traveling there.  He has no contact with his aunt and uncle on Taiwan.\n(Tr. 24-27; Answer; Exhibit A)\nApplicant submitted six character letters from colleagues and supervisors.  They regard him\nas intelligent, conscientious, hard-working, diligent, dependable, honest, discrete, and loyal.\nApplicant is also considered to have high ethical and moral standards.  His integrity is highly\nregarded.  On one project mentioned in one character letter, Applicant followed appropriate\nprotocols to secure his data, and established several more procedures himself to guard his data and\nresearch.  For the past three years, Applicant has had an interim security clearance and no violations\nare recorded. (Exhibits A to F)\nI take administrative notice of the PRC having a government in which the Chinese\nCommunist Party is the only political party allowed.  The PRC is a one-party authoritarian\ngovernment which has a long record of human rights abuses and espionage. The PRC human rights\nrecord has a history of serious abuses of fundamental human rights occurring, such a denial of free\nspeech and press, fair and open trials, and other basic rights recognized by the international\ncommunity.  The PRC continues to modernize its armed forces and acquire or develop advanced\nweapons.  The PRC engages regularly in military, economic, and industrial espionage, including\nstealing nuclear weapons technology, missile design information, and commercial technology.  The\nPRC also obtains commercial information through the use of front companies, buying dual-use\ntechnologies, and the direct collection of technology by non-intelligence agencies and individuals.\nThe PRC regards itself as the legitimate government of all of China, including Taiwan.  Since 1979,\nthe U.S. has recognized the PRC as the legal government of China under the \u201cone China\u201d policy.\nThe PRC engages in industrial and military espionage designed to collect proprietary and classified\ninformation.  Industrial espionage is intelligence gathering by a foreign country or a foreign company\nwith its government\u2019s help against a private U.S. company to obtain commercial secrets.  The United\nStates does billions of dollars of trade with the PRC annually. (Exhibit 2)\nPOLICIES\n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d  Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S.\n518, 528 (1988).  As Commander in Chief, the President has \u201cthe authority to . . . control access to\ninformation bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently\ntrustworthy to occupy a position . . . that will give that person access to such information.\u201d  Id. at\n527.  The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants\neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent the\nnational interest to do so.\u201d  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information with Industry\n\u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960).  Eligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the\nsecurity guidelines contained in the Directive.  An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of\n\n4\ndemonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security\nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3.\nThe adjudication process is based on the whole person concept.  All available, reliable\ninformation about the person, past and present, is to be taken into account in reaching a decision as\nto whether a person is an acceptable security risk.  Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth personnel\nsecurity guidelines, as well as the disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC)\nunder each guideline that must be carefully considered in making the overall common sense\ndetermination required.  \nIn evaluating the security worthiness of an applicant, the administrative judge must also\nassess the adjudicative process factors listed in \u00b6 6.3 of the Directive.  Those assessments include:\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct,\nand the extent of knowledgeable participation; (3) how recent and frequent the behavior was; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6)\nthe presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood\nof continuation or recurrence (See Directive, Section E2.2.1. of Enclosure 2). Because each security\ncase presents its own unique facts and circumstances, it should not be assumed that the factors\nexhaust the realm of human experience or that the factors apply equally in every case.  Moreover,\nalthough adverse information concerning a single condition may not be sufficient for an unfavorable\ndetermination, the individual may be disqualified if available information reflects a recent or\nrecurring pattern of questionable judgment, irresponsibility, or other behavior specified in the\nGuidelines.\nThe decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a determination as\nto the loyalty of the applicant.  See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7.  It is merely an indication that the applicant\nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for\nissuing a clearance.\nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the personal\nor professional history of the applicant that disqualify, or may disqualify, the applicant from being\neligible for access to classified information.  The Directive presumes a nexus or rational connection\nbetween proven conduct under any of the disqualifying conditions listed in the guidelines and an\napplicant\u2019s security suitability.  See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).  All that\nis required is proof of facts and circumstances that indicate an applicant is at risk for mishandling\nclassified information, or that an applicant does not demonstrate the high degree of judgment,\nreliability, or trustworthiness required of persons handling classified information.  ISCR Case No.\n00-0277, 2001 DOHA LEXIS 335 at **6-8 (App. Bd. 2001).  Once the Government has established\na prima facie case by substantial evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain,\nextenuate, or mitigate the facts.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of\ndemonstrating that is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security\nclearance. ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. 2002).  \u201cAny doubt as to whether access to\nclassified information is clearly consistent with national security will be resolved in favor of the\nnational security.\u201d Directive \u00b6 E2.2.2.  \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must,\non the side of denials.\u201d  Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  See Exec. Or. 12968 \u00a7 3.1(b).\n\n5\nBased upon a consideration of the evidence as a whole, I find the following adjudicative\nguideline most pertinent to an evaluation of the facts of this case:\nGuideline B:  The Concern: Foreign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the\nindividual has divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or induced to help\na foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way that is not in U.S. interests, or is\nvulnerable to pressure or coercion by any foreign interest.  Adjudication under this Guideline can\nand should consider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or financial\ninterest is located, including, but not limited to, such considerations as whether the foreign country\nis known to target United States citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with\na risk of terrorism. \u00b66\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe Government established by substantial evidence and Applicant\u2019s admissions each of the\nallegations in the SOR.\nForeign Influence:  The condition that could raise a security concern and may be\ndisqualifying (DC), which is applicable here, is \u00b67.a (contact with a foreign family member who is\na citizen of or resident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign\nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion).\nApplicant has family members on Taiwan, a grandmother whom he telephones twice a year,\nand an aunt and uncle with whom he has no contact.  His father works in the PRC for a Taiwanese\ncompany making auto parts.  His father, mother, and sister are U.S. citizens, as is Applicant.\nAfter the Government raised a disqualification, the burden shifted to Applicant to mitigate\nor rebut the allegations.  Two mitigating conditions (MC) apply: \u00b68.a (the nature of the relationships\nwith foreign persons, the country in which these persons are located, or the positions or activities of\nthose persons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a position\nof having to choose between the interests of the foreign individual and the interests of the U.S.), and\n\u00b68.b (there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of loyalty or obligation to\nthe foreign person is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships and\nloyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor\nof the U.S. interests).  \nApplicant has only distant familial relations with his grandmother on Taiwan.  His father is\na U.S. citizen working in the auto parts industry in the PRC.  The auto industry in the PRC is\nexpanding, and U.S. companies sell cars there and seek strategic alliances with PRC auto\nmanufacturers.  To coerce or pressure an auto parts production executive like Applicant's father\nwould injure well-developed business relationships, prove counter-productive for PRC forces, and\nbe highly unlikely because of the nature and position of Applicant's father in the total auto industry\nin the PRC.  Therefore, there is unlikely he will be placed in a position of having to choose between\nthose persons he knows in the PRC and the interests of the U.S.  Applicant's summer internship in\n2000 was part of his academic course of study.  He worked on Taiwan, not the PRC.  His travels to\nTaiwan and the PRC in 2002 were disclosed to his employer's security office before travel took\n\n6\nplace.  He undertook the travel only for family visits and tourist activities.  His monthly talks with\nhis father are normal family activities between two U.S. citizens.\nThere is no conflict of interest in Applicant\u2019s situation because of his deep and longstanding\nrelationships and loyalties to the United States.  There are many positive attributes to Applicant\u2019s\nlife as a U.S. citizen that weigh in favor of granting him a security clearance. He has extensive and\nlong-term contacts with the United States, arriving here 23 years ago as a child of five.  He became\na U.S. citizen when he was in fourth grade at the age of nine years.  He has lived here from 1984 to\n1992 when the family returned to Taiwan because his father had a management position there with\na U.S. company.  Applicant obtained a college degree here from 1997 to 2002, and has worked here\ncontinuously since then.  His parents have a home in the United States which they bought 20 years\nago, and his father returns home to the United States every opportunity he has when not working.\nHis sister was born in the United States.  He is a loyal American committed to his family and job in\nthe United States, and would resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the United States.  I give his\nhistory in the United States, his compliance with company security requirements, and his successful\nwork on an interim security clearance for the past three years great weight.  His testimony was\ncredible and persuasive on his close and dedicated attachments to the United States.\nWhole Person Analysis\n\u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make\nan affirmative determination that the person is eligible for a security clearance.\u201d AG \u00b6 2(a). \u201cEach\nsecurity clearance decision must be a fair and impartial common sense determination based upon\nconsideration of all the relevant and material information and the pertinent criteria and adjudication\npolicy.\u201d Directive \u00b6 6.3. \u201cAvailable, reliable information about the person, past and present,\nfavorable and unfavorable, should be considered in reaching a determination.\u201d AG \u00b6 2(a). In\nevaluating Applicant\u2019s case, I have considered the adjudicative process factors listed in the AG \u00b6\n2(a).\nI considered all the factors under the \"whole person concept.\"  Only the eighth factor, a\npotential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress applies.  Applicant's evidence is that he is not\nand would not be subject to pressure or coercion.  His connections to the United States are too long\nand strong to allow him to be subjected to PRC influence just because his father happens to work\nin the PRC now.  Applicant\u2019s history of living and working in the U.S., and his dedication to his\nimmediate family in the United States and his job are significant factors in his favor.  He is a serious\nstudent who already has three academic degrees from U.S. universities, and is working on his\ndoctorate at another U.S. university in a professional area he enjoys.  His father's job in the PRC is\nnot sufficient to influence Applicant to choose between the father, the PRC, and the United States\nin any particular situation when all his other connections of family, friends, and colleagues are in the\nUnited States.  All these factors show that there is no potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation,\nor duress upon Applicant.  I give great weight to the  character letters from his co-workers and\nsupervisors about his work ethic, and dedication to his job and security requirements.  I also\nconclude Applicant is credible in his explanations of his familial relationships and strong preference\nfor the United States.\nIn addition to the above facts, security determinations are predictive judgments and the best\npredictor of future performance is past performance.  Based on a review of his history and substantial\n\n7\nties to the United States, I conclude Applicant\u2019s potential for exploitation by the PRC, where his\nfather works presently, appears low and unlikely to occur.  Therefore, I conclude the foreign\ninfluence security concern for Applicant.  I also conclude the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept for Applicant.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nThe following are my conclusions as to each allegation in the SOR:\nParagraph 1.  Guideline B:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.  Clearance is\ngranted.\nPhilip S. Howe\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns raised under Guideline F,\nfinancial considerations, and Guideline E, personal conduct. Clearance is denied.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a\nsecurity clearance for Applicant. As required by Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 \u00b6 E3.1.2\n(Jan. 2, 1992), as amended, DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) on February 9, 2007\ndetailing the basis for its decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline F (financial\nconsiderations) and Guideline E (personal conduct) of the revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG)\nissued on December 29, 2005 and implemented by the Department of Defense effective September\n1, 2006. Applicant answered the SOR in writing on February 28, 2007, and elected to have a hearing\nbefore an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on June 1, 2007. I convened a hearing\non June 26, 2007, to consider whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or\ncontinue a security clearance for Applicant. The Government offered nine exhibits that were marked\nas GE 1-9 and admitted without objections. Applicant testified on his behalf and offered one exhibit\nthat was marked as AE A and was admitted without objection. The record was held open to allow\nApplicant to submit additional exhibits. Applicant did not submit any other exhibits and the record\nwas closed. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on July 18, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant is a 65-year-old truck driver who is occasionally employed. He has held a secret\nsecurity clearance since 1995. He stated he was the part-owner of a trucking company with his wife\nuntil 2004, when they divorced and he gave her the whole company. She continues to own the\ncompany and he occasionally takes jobs from her, but she does not pay him. Instead she pays his\nutilities, trailer fees, and food.  He does not receive any other spending money from her. He receives\n1\napproximately $900 from social security each month. He pays $100 to a disabled brother.

Applicant admitted he has not paid taxes in fifteen years.  He also admitted that he did file\n2\n3\ntaxes, but not every year.  He then stated his wife would take care of the taxes and he did not bother\n4\nwith them.  It is unclear for which years he was referring. He stated he never had the money to pay\n5\nthe taxes.  When he owned the trucking company his gross monthly income was approximately\n6\n$4,000-5,000 a month. After he paid his monthly expenses he would have $600-700 left.  He did not\n7\nwithhold money from his pay for taxes during the tax year and then would be unable to pay the tax\ndebt when due. He has not worked full-time since 2004. \nApplicant does not believe he owes the amount alleged to the IRS. He also stated he\ncontacted the IRS once in 1992 because he was trying to negotiate a settlement for his taxes. The IRS\nwanted him to pay $400 a month. He did not agree to the offer and he never contacted the IRS\nagain.  \n8\nApplicant stated he hired an attorney approximately five to six years ago to help straighten\nout his taxes. A vague nonspecific letter was provided by the attorney.  The letter stated that\n9\nApplicant\u2019s tax liability was reduced by the IRS because he had not taken applicable deductions and\nhe does not owe the amount that is alleged. The attorney claimed he filed amended returns for\nApplicant and the IRS \u201cdeclared the remaining rather small tax debts-uncollectible.\u201d  No supporting\n10\ndocuments were provided. He further stated \nI am not at all worried [Applicant] will not be able to meet any requirements to pay\nreasonable monthly amounts on taxes owed should the IRS change its mind and\ndecide he should pay something at this time. His tax liabilities actually present no\nburden to him-given the declaration that the IRS is not interested in collecting even\nthe rather small amounts left-and in any event the IRS would of course be glad to\narrange payments he could afford-they are required by law to do that.11\nAgain, nothing was provided to show that the IRS reduced and forgave all Applicant\u2019s tax debts. His\nattorney claimed in his letter that all of the tax liens were reduced and he believes the statute of\nlimitations had run on the debts. No supporting documents from the IRS were provided to show the\n\nTr. 23.\n12\nGE 9; These additional debts are not considered for disqualifying purposes, but will be considered when\n13\nanalyzing the whole person, Applicant\u2019s ability to repay the debts and his crediblity.\nTr. 36.\n14\nTr. 38.\n15\nTr. 25\n16\nGE 1 at 10.\n17\nTr. 27.\n18\n4\namounts were reduced and barred by the statute of limitations. He also claimed he represented\nApplicant in tax court to have the amount reduced. No official court documentation was provided\nto support this assertion.\nIn addition to tax debts, Applicant has approximately $10,377 in medical debts alleged as\ndelinquent. These debts were placed for collection in September 2004 and June 2001. Applicant\nstated these are not his debts but belong to his ex-wife.  These debts were incurred while Applicant\n12\nand his wife were still married. On Applicant\u2019s most recent credit report it lists 16 new medical debts\nthat are delinquent.  Applicant denied he owed these debts, again stating they belonged to his ex-\n13\nwife. He has not contacted the credit agency to dispute any of the debts, nor has he had his ex-wife\nattempt to resolve them.  He did not contact any of the medical creditors to advise them he should\n14\nnot be billed for services or to arrange a payment plan. He did not provide any documentation to\nshow the debts do not belong to him. He admitted he did get services from one of the medical\ncreditors and paid $1,000 cash.  He has no medical insurance. He stated prior to going to the\n15\nVeteran\u2019s Administration for medical services, he paid his medical bills with cash.16\nOn Applicant\u2019s security clearance application (SCA) dated March 24, 2006, he lists his\nposition at his place of employment from \u201c5/1988 to present\u201d as \u201cowner-operator.\u201d  This contradicts\n17\nhis testimony that he gave the truck business to his ex-wife when they divorced. When questioned\nabout whether he and his ex-wife still live together, he denied that they did. However, he lists his\naddress and lot number of his trailer as the same address and lot number of his ex-wife\u2019s. \nApplicant answered \u201cno\u201d to questions 28a and 28b on his security clearance application,\ninquiring if in the last seven years he had any debts over 180 days delinquent and whether he was\ncurrently more than 90 days delinquent on any debts. Applicant\u2019s explanation for why he failed to\nlist he had delinquent debts over 180 days and 90 days past due was because he confused the word\n\u201cdebt\u201d with the word \u201cloan,\u201d believing the question was inquiring if he was delinquent on a car or\ntruck loan and he was not, so he answered no. He stated he misunderstood the question.  I find\n18\nApplicant\u2019s testimony was not credible. \nPOLICIES\n\nDepartment of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).\n19\nId. at 527.\n20\nExec.

An individual who is\nfinancially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. Compulsive\ngambling is a concern as it may lead to financial crimes including espionage. Affluence that cannot\nbe explained by known sources of income is also a security concern. It may indicate proceeds from\nfinancially profitable criminal acts.\nBased on all the evidence, Financial Considerations Disqualifying Condition (FC DC) 19(a)\n(inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts) and FC DC 19(c) (a history of not meeting financial\nobligations), apply in this case. Applicant has admittedly not paid his taxes in 15 years and even if\nhe were to be believed that he does not owe the amount alleged, he has not provided any\ndocumentation to show he paid a reduced amount or the tax debts were forgiven. He owes medical\ndebts that he has not paid, and even if he were to be believed that these debts are for medical services\nfor his ex-wife, the debts were incurred while he was married to her. In addition, he has not\ncontacted the creditors to explain the debts or resolve them. Both disqualifying conditions apply.\nI have considered all the Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions (FC MC), and\nespecially considered FC MC 20(a) (the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or\noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the\nindividual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment), FC MC 20(b) (the conditions\nthat resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of\nemployment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or\nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances), FC MC 20(c) (the\nperson has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear indications\nthat the problem is being resolved or is under control), and FC MC 20(d) (the individual initiated\na good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts). Applicant failed to pay\n\nTr. 19.\n33\n7\nhis taxes for fifteen years and continues to owe the IRS for back taxes, penalties and interest. He has\nmade no attempt to repay any of the debts. He did provide information that he sought assistance with\nhis tax problems, but nothing was offered to support he has made even a nominal payment to the IRS\nor set up any payment plan. The debts are recent and because he did not plan for his tax debt each\nyear, his actions cast doubt on his judgment and reliability. He is aware there are medical debts that\nwere incurred while he was married, but denies responsibility for them, and has not taken any action\nto contact the creditors or the credit agency reporting it. These debts were not the result of behavior\nthat was beyond his control. Applicant has chosen to ignore these debts. Despite contacting an\nattorney, no substantive evidence was provided to show the problem is being resolved or under\ncontrol. Applicant has not made a good faith effort to repay his debts. I find none of the disqualifying\nconditions apply. \nGuideline E\u2014personal conduct\nGuideline E-Personal Conduct is a concern because conduct involving questionable\njudgment, lack of candor, dishonest, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified\ninformation. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful and candid answers during the\nsecurity clearance process or any other failure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\nBased on all the evidence, Personal Conduct Disqualifying Condition (PC DC) 16(a)\n(deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any personnel security\nquestionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine\nemployment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or\ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities) applies. Applicant intentionally failed to list\ndebts he was aware he owed and were delinquent. Applicant was well aware of his tax debts and that\nhe had not paid his taxes in 15 years. Applicant\u2019s explanation and testimony for why he failed to\ndivulge his delinquent debts was not credible. He stated he misunderstood the question and believed\nhe only had to divulge delinquent loan payments.  The questions are very clear. If Applicant was\n33\ntruly confused by the question about his delinquent debts, he certainly would have listed the tax liens\nagainst him as required under Question 27c. Instead he answered \u201cno\u201d to that question. This\nomission is considered in determining whether Applicant was just confused, or whether he\ndeliberately failed to list his financial problems. I find after observing his demeanor and testimony,\nthat he deliberately omitted and concealed this derogatory financial information.\nI have considered all of the Personal Conduct Mitigating Conditions (PC MC ) and especially\nconsidered PC MC 17(a) (the individual made prompt, good faith efforts to correct the omission,\nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts) and PC MC 17(e) (the\nindividual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation\nor duress). I find neither applies. Applicant\u2019s testimony at his hearing was not credible and not\nbelievable. No evidence was provided to show Applicant made a good faith effort to correct his\nomission and falsification before being confronted. He failed to offer any positive steps he has taken\nto reduce or eliminate vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation or duress. I find neither of the\nabove mitigating conditions apply.\n\n8\nThe Whole Person\nIn all adjudications, the protection of our national security is the paramount concern. The\nobjective of the security-clearance process is the fair-minded, commonsense assessment of a person\u2019s\nlife to make an affirmative determination that the person is eligible for a security clearance. Indeed,\nthe adjudicative process is a careful weighing of a number of variables in considering the \u201cwhole\nperson\u201d concept. It recognizes that we should view a person by the totality of his or her acts,\nomissions, motivations and other variables. Each case must be adjudged on its own merits, taking\ninto consideration all relevant circumstances, and applying sound judgment, mature thinking, and\ncareful analysis.\nIn addition to considering the specific disqualifying and mitigating conditions under the\nguideline, I have also considered the adjudicative process factors listed in \u00b6 2a (1)-(9) of the\nGuidelines to be considered in evaluating a person\u2019s eligibility to hold a security clearance.\nSpecifically these are: (1) the nature, extent and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances\nand surrounding the conduct to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency\nof the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation was voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent\nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion,\nexploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. Although the presence\nor absence of a particular condition or factor for or against clearance is not outcome determinative,\nthe Guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against this policy guidance.\nI considered all the evidence provided and also considered the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept in\nevaluating Applicant\u2019s security clearance concerns. I considered Applicant\u2019s age, employment and\nfinancial situation. I considered that Applicant did seek assistance from an attorney. I also considered\nthat Applicant has not taken any action to contact the creditors, dispute debts, make payments, or\nprovide documentation that he is not responsible or he is making nominal payments. In addition, I\nconsidered Applicant\u2019s testimony regarding his failure to divulge his debts on his SCA. He was not\nbelievable. I conclude Applicant has failed to mitigate the security clearance concerns raised by\nfinancial considerations under Guideline F, and personal conduct, under Guideline E. \nFORMAL FINDINGS\nThe following are my conclusions as to each allegation in the SOR:\nParagraph 1. Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g:\nAgainst Applicant\n\n9\nParagraph 2. Guideline E:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all of the circumstances in this case, it is not clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. Clearance is denied.\nCarol G. Ricciardello\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Stevens, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nSYNOPSIS\nApplicant\u2019s accrual of 86,000 of delinquent debt and his security clearance omissions\ncreate security concerns that he failed to mitigate at the hearing. Clearance is denied.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\n\nApplicant admits the debt listed in SOR subparagraph 1.b, but denies the amount alleged due.\n1\nTr. 36.\n2\nTr. 42.\n3\nTr. 37.\n4\n2\nOn March 27, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued Applicant\na Statement of Reasons (SOR) explaining why it was not clearly consistent with the national interest\nto grant or continue a security clearance. This action was taken under Executive Order 10865, dated\nFebruary 20, 1960, as amended, and DoD Directive 5220.6, dated January 2, 1992, as amended. He\nanswered the SOR on May 15, 2007, and requested a hearing.\nThe case was assigned to me on June 28, 2007. On July 6, 2007, DOHA issued a notice of\nhearing scheduling it for August 2, 2007. During the hearing, I received 10 government exhibits, 14\nApplicant exhibits, and Applicant\u2019s testimony. DOHA received the transcript on August 15, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT \nApplicant admitted all of the allegations in SOR except subparagraphs 1.n through 1.q, and\n2.b.  The admissions are incorporated into the findings of fact. In addition, I make the following\n1\nfindings of fact.\nApplicant is a 63-year-old married man. He earned a bachelor\u2019s degree majoring in\nmathematics in 1969 and a master\u2019s degree in physics in 1974. He worked in the federal government\nfor 25 years until his retirement in 1993. Since then, he has been working on missile programs as an\noperations research analyst for a defense contractor. He has held a security clearance for more than\n30 years.\nSince 1997, Applicant has accrued approximately 86,000 of delinquent debt. Two of the\ndelinquencies are utilities (1.a and 1.g) and the remainder are either owed on lines of credit or owed\nto credit card companies.\nApplicant collectively owes the utility companies approximately $200. He is \u201cin the process\nof communicating\u201d with the creditor listed in subparagraph 1.a,  and has been corresponding with\n2\nthe creditor listed in subparagraph 1.g for approximately one year.  He has satisfied neither debt.\n3\nSubparagraphs 1.b, 1.f, and 1.j comprise approximately $87,000 of the SOR debt.\nSubparagraph 1.b has been delinquent for approximately 10 years.  Applicant alleges he only owes\n4\n$25,000 toward the satisfaction of this delinquency rather than $62,000 as alleged. He offered no\ndocumentary proof to verify his contention, nor any evidence that he has begun to make payments.\nExhibit 4 establishes that he owes the creditor $62,000. \n\nTr. 41.\n5\nExhibit 3 at 4.\n6\nTr. 90.\n7\nTr. 98.\n8\nTr. 95.\n9\nAccording to the original SOR allegation (subparagraph 2.b), Applicant pleaded guilty to the DUI charge. In\n10\nhis Answer, he denied this, asserting that he pleaded guilty to a reduced charge. The government moved to amend the\nSOR to conform to his answer, Applicant consented, and I incorporated it into the Findings of Fact.\n3\nSubparagraph 1.f is a line of credit Applicant opened in 1997 which is approximately $7,450\ndelinquent. He contends he has been making payments toward its satisfaction for one year. He\nprovided no documentary support to verify this contention.  \n5\nApplicant owes approximately $7,640 towards the satisfaction of the creditor listed in\nsubparagraph 1.j. By June 2005, the creditor had reported this delinquency as a loss.  Applicant has\n6\nnot satisfied or begun making payments on any of the remaining SOR debts.\nApplicant met with an investigative agent in October 2005.  Among other things, she\n7\ninformed him of the government\u2019s concerns regarding his finances. Seven months later, Applicant\nbegan contacting creditors to resolve the delinquencies. \nApplicant has not sought the assistance of a credit counselor. For the past six years,\n8\nApplicant has earned a gross income of approximately $90,000 per year.9\nIn January 1991, Applicant was charged with driving under the influence (DUI). In October\n1991, the court fined him $500 and dismissed the charge.\nIn August 1995, Applicant was charged with assault causing bodily injury after a domestic\nviolence incident. The charge was later dismissed.\nIn April 1997, Applicant was charged with DUI. In March 2001, he pled guilty to a reduced\ncharge of obstruction of a public highway, was fined approximately $1,700 and ordered to attend\nDUI school.  \n10\nApplicant was charged in January 1999 with DUI. He pled guilty to three lesser traffic\noffenses, and was fined $400.\nIn July 2000, Applicant was charged with assault causing bodily injury after a domestic\nviolence incident. The charge was later dismissed.\nApplicant completed a security clearance Application in October 2004. He did not disclose\nhis criminal charges as required in response to Questions 24 and 26, and his financial delinquencies\nin response to Questions 38 and 39. When asked to explain these omissions at the hearing, he stated\n\nTr. 82.\n11\n4\nthat he \u201cwas a little cavalier\u201d in completing the application, and did not read the questions carefully\nenough.11\nPOLICIES\nThe adjudicative guidelines, as revised December 29, 2005, and implemented September 1,\n2006, apply to the analysis of this case. In addition to brief introductory explanations for each\nguideline, they are divided into those that may be considered in deciding whether to deny or revoke\nan individual\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information (disqualifying conditions) and those\nthat may be considered in deciding whether to grant an individual\u2019s eligibility for access to classified\ninformation (mitigating conditions).\nBecause the entire process is a scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person\nconcept,\u201d all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and\nunfavorable, should be considered in making a meaningful decision. Specifically these are: (1) the\nnature and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the age of the\napplicant; (5) the extent to which the participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the\npotential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or\nrecurrence.\nThe following adjudicative guidelines are raised:\nGuideline F - Financial Considerations: Failure or inability to live within one\u2019s\nmeans, satisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control,\nlack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can\nraise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information.\nGuideline G - Excessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of\nquestionable judgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness.\nGuideline E - Personal Conduct: Conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of\ncandor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful and candid\nanswers during the security clearance process or any other failure to cooperate with\nthe security clearance process.\nGuideline J - Criminal Conduct: Criminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s\njudgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a\nperson\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations.\n\nSee generally, Directive, Sec. 2.3, Sec. 2.5.3, Sec. 3.2, and Sec. 4.2.\n12\n5\nConditions pertaining to these adjudicative guidelines that could raise a security concern and may\nbe disqualifying, as well as those which could mitigate security concerns, are set forth and discussed\nin the conclusions below.\nSince the protection of national security is the paramount consideration, the final decision\nin each case must be reached by applying the standard that the issuance of the clearance is \u201cclearly\nconsistent with the national interest.\u201d  In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions\n12\nthat are based on the evidence contained in the record.\nThe Government is responsible for presenting evidence to establish facts in the SOR that\nhave been controverted. The applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to rebut, explain,\nextenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by the Government, and has the\nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\nCONCLUSIONS\nFinancial Considerations\nApplicant\u2019s history of financial problems triggers the application of Financial Considerations\nDisqualifying Conditions (FC DC) 19(a): inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts, FC DC 19(c):\na history of not meeting financial obligations, and FC DC 19(e): consistent spending beyond one\u2019s\nmeans, which may be indicated by excessive indebtedness, significant negative cash flow, high debt-\nto-income ratio, and/or other financial analysis.\nI have considered all of the mitigating conditions and conclude none apply. Applicant\ncontends he is negotiating settlement amounts with some of the creditors, and contesting debts that\naccrued as the result of identity theft, but offered scant corroborating evidence. Considering that his\nhighest debt (subparagraph 1.b) has been delinquent for more than 10 years, his contention that he\nis resolving his debts, absent supporting evidence has little probative value. Applicant has failed to\nmitigate the financial considerations security concern.\nAlcohol Consumption\nApplicant\u2019s history of alcohol-related arrests triggers the application of Alcohol Consumption\nDisqualifying Conditions (AC DC) 22(a): alcohol related incidents away from work, such as driving\nwhile under the influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other incidents\nof concern. His last arrest was more than eight and a half years ago, and there is no other record\nevidence of alcohol abuse. Alcohol Consumption Mitigating Condition (AC MC) 23(a): So much\ntime has passed . . . that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current\nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment, applies. Applicant has mitigated the alcohol\nconsumption security concern.\nPersonal Conduct\n\n6\nApplicant\u2019s SF-86 omissions trigger the issue of whether Personal Conduct (PC DC) 16 (a):\ndeliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any personnel security\nquestionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine\nemployment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or\ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities, applies. Given his level of education and\nexperience, Applicant\u2019s explanation that he misread the questions is not credible. PC DC 16(a)\napplies without mitigation. Also, I was troubled by Applicant\u2019s assertion that he completed the\nsecurity clearance application in a cavalier manner. This demonstrates a disregard for the\ninvestigative process that alone generates an unmitigated personal conduct security concern.\nCriminal Conduct\nApplicant\u2019s security clearance application omissions represent falsifications under 18 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 1001 for the reasons set forth in the Personal Conduct section above. Considered in tandem with\nhis history of arrests, Criminal Conduct Disqualifying Condition 31(a): a single serious crime or\nmultiple lesser offenses, and 31(c): allegation of admission of criminal conduct, regardless of\nwhether the person was formally charged, formally prosecuted or convicted, apply without\nmitigation.\nWhole Person Concept\nApplicant failed to take responsibility for the accrual of his financial delinquencies. Because\nof the dishonesty demonstrated in completing the security clearance application, and the length of\ntime many of his debts have been delinquent, his promises to begin resolving them were not\npersuasive. Evaluating this case in the context of the whole person concept, I conclude that Applicant\nremains a security concern. Clearance is denied. \nFORMAL FINDINGS\nParagraph 1 \u2013 Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a -1.r:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2 - Guideline G:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a - 2.c:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 3 - Guideline E:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 3.a - 3.d\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 4 - Guideline J:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 4.a - 4.d\nAgainst Applicant\n\n7\nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.

One sister, an uncle,\nand his wife\u2019s parents are citizens and residents of Afghanistan.  Except for the one sister, he has had\nno contact with his wife\u2019s family for over five years, and no contact with his own family since he\nimmigrated to the U.S. in 1986.  Having worked in the past as an interpreter for the military, he\nunderstands the discretion that is required for such a position.  His ties to the United States outweigh\nthe risks to his family living in Afghanistan.  He successfully mitigated the security concerns about\nforeign influence.  Clearance is granted.\n\nGovernment Exhibit 1 (Security Clearance Application (SF 86), dated June 23, 2004).\n1\nTr. at 6.\n2\nSee ISCR Case No. 05-11292 at 4 n.1 (App. Bd. Apr. 12, 2007); ISCR Case No. 02-24875 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2006)\n3\n(citing ISCR Case No. 02-18668 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 10, 2004)); McLeod v. Immigration and Naturalization  Service,\n802 F.2d 89, 93 n.4 (3d Cir. 1986)).\nSee Stein, ADMINISTRATIVE LAW, Section 25.01 (Bender & Co. 2006) (listing fifteen types of facts for administrative\n4\nnotice). \n3\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn June 23, 2004, Applicant submitted a Security Clearance Application (SF 86).   The\n1\nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a security clearance\nfor Applicant.  As required by Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within\nIndustry, dated February 20, 1960, as amended, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6,\nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive), dated January 2,\n1992, as amended, DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) on May 29, 2007, detailing the\nbasis for its decision \u2013 security concerns raised under Guideline B (Foreign Influence) of the\nDirective.  The President issued revised adjudicative guidelines (Guidelines) on December 30, 2005.\nDoD implemented them on September 1, 2006.  Pending official amendment/reissue of DoD\nDirective 5220.6, the Guidelines are to be used in all cases when the SOR is dated on or after\nSeptember 1, 2006.  Because the SOR was issued after September 1, 2006, DoD policy requires that\nthis case proceed under the revised guidelines. \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on July 12, 2007, and elected to have a hearing\nbefore an administrative judge.  DOHA assigned the case to me on August 3, 2007, and issued a\nNotice of Hearing on August 8, 2007.  I convened a hearing on August 27, 2007, to consider whether\nit is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant's  security clearance.\nApplicant made a knowing and voluntary waiver of the rule requiring15days notice of the hearing,\nbecause he had actual notice more than 15 days prior to the hearing.   The government offered five\n2\nexhibits, marked as Exhibits 1-5.  Applicant offered no exhibits.  All exhibits were admitted without\nobjection.  DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on September 5, 2007.\nPROCEDURAL RULINGS\nAdministrative Notice\nDepartment Counsel requested administrative notice of the facts in Government Exhibits A1\nthrough A8.  Applicant stated he had no objection to administrative notice of the exhibits. \nAdministrative or official notice is the appropriate type of notice used for administrative\nproceedings.   The most common basis for administrative notice at ISCR proceedings, is to notice\n3\nfacts that are either well known or from government reports.   I took administrative notice of various\n4\nfacts derived from Government Exhibits A1 through A8, as indicated under subheading\n\u201cAfghanistan\u201d of this decision.\n\nTr. at 10, 17.\n5\nId. at 19-20.\n6\nId. at 20-21.\n7\nId. at 21-25.\n8\nId. at 26-29.\n9\nId. at 11-12.\n10\n4\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant admitted the allegations contained in the SOR.  The admissions are incorporated\nherein as findings of fact.  After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and\nupon due consideration of same, I make the following additional findings of fact: \nApplicant is a 50-year-old interpreter employed by a defense contractor.   He is  married and\n5\nhas four children.  His wife has kidney problems and takes as much as 16 different medicationsIn\n2005, a fifth child died, after being beaten and robbed while on a trip to Mexico.  After graduating\nfrom high school, Applicant attended an Afghan police academy.  He then worked for a municipal\npolice force for about 10 years, working narcotics, and attained the rank of captain.   In 1986, he\n6\nimmigrated to the United States.  He worked odd jobs in such places as gas stations and convenience\nstores until 2004, when he commenced working for a defense contractor.   He has worked overseas\n7\nassignments for the military.  All of his time was spent on various military bases, and he was not\npermitted off base, nor was he permitted to have any interaction with foreign nationals off the base.\nHe had no adverse contact with any foreign authorities, and maintains no contact with any other\nforeign national he may have met on those trips.  Since he left home in 1986, he has not seen any of\nhis family living if Afghanistan except one sister in 2005.  She contacted him about his son\u2019s\naccident.  He has no family contact because of his job, and because if he saw them, they would\ninquire about his job and ask him for money.8\nApplicant\u2019s wife\u2019s parents are citizens and residents of Afghanistan.  It has been five years\nsince he has seen his mother-in-law.  His father-in-law is in the retail business, selling groceries,\ncarpets, and other items.  His wife has no contact with her father since he took another wife, as\npermitted under Muslim law.  She calls her mother every three or four months.9\nApplicant\u2019s spouse is a citizen of Afghanistan, and resides in the United States.  His wife\napplied for citizenship but did not pass the writing test.  One son has passed the test but forgot the\ncourt date when he was to have been sworn-in.   At least two of his children are citizens of\n10\nAfghanistan.  Two other children are citizens and residents of the United States.  A sister is a citizen\nand resident of Afghanistan.  He has visited her twice since emigrating to the United States.  He has\ncontact with her by phone about six times a year.  He\u2019s never been contacted or approached by any\nrepresentative from a foreign government regarding his sister and does not feel he can be put under\nduress or blackmail due to his relationship with his sister.  He is aware of his responsibility to report\n\n Government Exhibit 4 (Applicant\u2019s Interview, dated December 29, 2005) at 1-4.  \n11\nId. at 29-31.\n12\nAdministrative Exhibit 1 (US Department Of State, Background Note: Afghanistan, dated May 2007) at 1-6.\n13\n5\nany such incident to his security officer if he was ever approached.  He has never been approached\nby a representative from a foreign government.\nApplicant has another sister who is a citizen and resident of the US.  One brother is a resident\nand citizen of the United States, and has worked as a translator for the same company that Applicant\nworked for. Another brother, born in Afghanistan, is now a resident and citizen of Germany.  An\nuncle, who he has little or no contact with,  is a citizen and resident of Afghanistan.   Applicant has\n11\nnot had any business contacts or developed any new personal relationships in a foreign country.  He\nhas no business or financial interest in a foreign country.  He does not engage in any activity that he\nfears disclosure of that activity could lead to blackmail or coercion.  He is not engaged in any illegal\nactivities.  There have been no request or threats by any foreign national that Applicant should have\nreported.\nApplicant traveled to Afghanistan on at least two occasions to visit his sister who lives there.\nHe provided financial support to various family members living in Afghanistan when the Taliban\nwas still in control, but hasn\u2019t done so since 2002, and would not now because of his job.12\nAfghanistan\nAfghanistan has been an independent nation since August 19, 1919, after the British\nrelinquished control.  A monarchy ruled from 1919 until a military coup in 1973.  Following a\nSoviet-supported coup in 1978, a Marxist government emerged.  Relations between Afghanistan and\nthe Soviet Union became tense after the Soviet Union moved to take advantage of the 1978 coup.\nIn December 1979, Soviet forces invaded and occupied Afghanistan.  Afghan freedom fighters,\nknown as mujaheddin, opposed the communist regime.  The resistance movement eventually lead\nto an agreement known as the Geneva Accords, signed by Pakistan, Afghanistan, the United States,\nand the Soviet Union, which ensured Soviet forces withdrew by February 1989.  The mujaheddin\nwere no party to the negotiations for the accords and refused to accept them.  As a result, a civil war\ncontinued after the Soviet withdrawal.  Fighting continued among militias with ethnic, clan,\nreligious, and personality differences.  To resolve these differences, leaders of Peshawar-based\nmujaheddin groups established an interim Islamic Jihad Council in mid-April 1992 to assume power\nin Kabul.  Rival factions created a great deal of political turmoil.  The country sank into anarchy.\nIn the mid-1990s, the Taliban rose to power, largely due to the anarchy and  warlordism that arose\nafter the Soviet withdrawal.  By the end of 1998, the Taliban expanded its control until it occupied\nabout 90% of the country.  The Taliban sought to impose an extreme interpretation of Islam on the\nentire country and committed massive human rights violations, particularly against females.  The\nTaliban also committed serious atrocities against minority populations and provided sanctuary to\nOsama bin Laden, Al Qa\u2019ida, and other terrorist organizations.  After the September 11, 2001\nterrorist attacks, demands to expel bin Laden and his followers were rejected by the Taliban.  U.S.\nand coalition forces commenced military operations in October 2001 that forced the Taliban out of\npower.  A new democratic government took power in 2004.13\n\nAdministrative Exhibit 4 (US Department Of State, Country Reports on Human Rights Practices 2006-Afghanistan,\n14\ndated March 6, 2007) at 1-2.\nAdministrative Exhibit 2 (US Department Of State, Consular Information Sheet-Afghanistan, dated September 15,\n15\n2006) at 1.\nAdministrative Exhibit 6 (Annual Threat Assessment of the Director of National Intelligence, dated January 11, 2007)\n16\nat 3.\nId.  at 1-3.\n17\nAdministrative Exhibit 4, supra, note 14, at 2; Administrative Exhibit 3, (US Department Of State, Travel Warning-\n18\nAfghanistan, dated April 4, 2007) at 1; Administrative Exhibit 6, supra, note 16, at 3.\nAdministrative Exhibit 5 (US Department Of State, Country Reports on Terrorism-2006, Chapter 2, Country Reports:\n19\n2005, South and Central Asia Overview, dated April 30, 2007) at 1-3; Administrative Exhibit 8 (US Department Of State,\nCountry Reports on Terrorism-2005, Chapter 5, Country Reports: South and Central Asia Overview, dated April 28,\n2006) at 2. \nAdministrative Exhibit 6, supra, note 16, at 1.\n20\n6\nDespite the new democratic government, Afghanistan\u2019s human rights record has remained\npoor.  The causes for this include the continuing deadly insurgency, the weakness of central\ngovernmental institutions, and ongoing recovery efforts from two decades of war.  Abuses include\nextra-judicial killings, torture, official impunity, restrictions on freedoms of press, religion,\nmovement, and association, violence and societal discrimination against women and minorities.  In\naddition, numerous people including civilians were killed by security and factional forces, as well\nas by terrorists and insurgents, including the Taliban and Al Qa\u2019ida.14\nDespite progress made since the Taliban was deposed, Afghanistan still faces many daunting\nchallenges, among these are: defeating an active insurgency; recovering from more than 20 years of\ncivil strife; dealing with many years of drought; and rebuilding a shattered infrastructure.\nAdditionally, Afghanistan faces the challenge of developing a rule of law within its borders.   Many\n15\nof the challenges are significantly exacerbated by terrorism.16\nThe director of national intelligence reports that Afghanistan has been unable to provide good\ngovernance and sustain the rule of law within its borders.  He further states that this inability enables\nnon-state actors and hostile states to assault the fundamental building blocks of international order,\nhelping to create terrorist safe havens, and ungoverned regions that endanger the international\ncommunity and its citizens, thereby threatening the national security of the United States and support\nfor freedom and democracy.17\nTaliban and Al Qa\u2019ida forces, in addition to other insurgents, continue to operate in\nAfghanistan, and have killed numerous civilians during the attacks.   Although programs and\n18\nmilitary operations designed to combat terrorism and lawlessness have been continuing, there was\nan increase in activity by terrorist groups in Afghanistan during 2005 and 2006.   Several non-state\n19\nactors, including international terrorist groups, conduct intelligence activities as effectively as\ncapable state intelligence services.   While progress has been made, the Taliban-led insurgency\n20\nremains strong and resilient, particularly in the Pashtun south and east, and they have been able to\n\nAdministrative Exhibit 5, supra, note 19, at 1-2.\n21\nAdministrative Exhibit 8, supra, note 19, at 2.\n22\nAdministrative Exhibit 3, supra, note 18, at 1-3.\n23\n7\ncontinue recruiting foot-soldiers from its core base of rural Pashtuns.   Terrorists and anti-coalition\n21\nmilitants targeted international non-governmental organization and United Nations workers, as well\nas recipients of non-governmental assistance.22\nThe State Department, in a recent travel warning, warns against travel to Afghanistan by US\ncitizens due to ongoing threats to kidnap or assassinate U.S. citizens and non-governmental workers\nand the inability of Afghan authorities to maintain order or ensure security.  The warning notes\nactivity of terrorist groups and other groups hostile to the U.S. within Afghanistan.  Terrorist actions\nmay include, but are no not limited to, suicide operations, bombings, assassinations, carjackings,\nrocket attacks, assaults, or kidnappings..  No part of Afghanistan is safe or immune from violence.23\nPOLICIES\nIn an evaluation of an applicant\u2019s security suitability, an administrative judge must consider\nthe \u201cAdjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility For Access to Classified Information\u201d\n(Guidelines).  In addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative\nguidelines are divided into Disqualifying Conditions (DC) and Mitigating Conditions (MC), which\nare used to determine an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible ironclad rules of law.  Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed\nin the adjudicative process. Guideline \u00b6 2.  An administrative judge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal\nis a fair, impartial and common sense decision.  Because the entire process is a conscientious\nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person concept,\u201d an administrative judge\nconsiders all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and\nunfavorable, in making a decision. Guideline \u00b6 2(c).\nSpecifically, an administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors\nlisted at Guideline \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency\nand recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5)\nextent to which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d\nSince the protection of the national security is the paramount consideration, the final decision\nin each case is arrived at by applying the standard that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being\nconsidered for access to classified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d\nGuideline \u00b6 2(b).  In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable,\nlogical and based on the evidence contained in the record.  Likewise, I have avoided drawing\ninferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\n\n\u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion\n24\nin light of all the contrary evidence in the record.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing\nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.32.1).  \u201cThis is something less than the weight of the evidence, and the possibility of drawing two\ninconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent [a Judge\u2019s] finding from being supported by substantial\nevidence.\u201d Consolo v. Federal Maritime Comm\u2019n, 383 U.S. 607, 620 (1966).  \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a\nscintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4  Cir. 1994).\nth\n\u201cThe Administrative Judge considers the record evidence as a whole, both favorable and unfavorable, evaluates\n25\nApplicant\u2019s past and current circumstances in light of the provisions of the Directive, and decide[s] whether Applicant\nhas met his burden of persuasion under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 04-10340 at 2 (App. Bd. July 6, 2006).\nExecutive Order 10865, \u00a7 7.\n26\n8\nIn the decision-making process, facts must be established by \u201csubstantial evidence.\u201d   The\n24\nGovernment initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish a case which demonstrates,\nin accordance with the Directive, that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant\nor continue an applicant\u2019s access to classified information.  Once the Government has produced\nsubstantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, the burden shifts to Applicant to present \u201cwitnesses\nand other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by\nDepartment Counsel, and [applicant] has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a\nfavorable clearance decision.\u201d  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  The burden of disproving a mitigating condition\nnever shifts to the Government.  See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).25\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with\nthe Government predicated upon trust and confidence.  This relationship transcends normal duty\nhours and endures throughout off-duty hours.  The Government reposes a high degree of trust and\nconfidence in individuals to whom it grants access to classified information.  Decisions under this\nDirective include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk an applicant may deliberately or\ninadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified information.  Such decisions entail a certain\ndegree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nThe scope of an administrative judge\u2019s decision is limited.  Nothing in this Decision should\nbe construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole or in part, on any express or implied\ndetermination as to Applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or patriotism.26\nCONCLUSIONS\nGuideline \u00b6 6. The Concern. Foreign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the\nindividual has divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or induced to help\na foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way that is not in U.S. interests, or is\nvulnerable to pressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Adjudication under this Guideline can and\nshould consider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or financial interest\nis located, including, but not limited to, such considerations as whether the foreign country is known\nto target United States citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a risk of\nterrorism.\n\nSee ISCR Case No. 03-02382 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 15, 2006); ISCR Case No. 99-0424 (App. Bd. Feb. 8, 2001).\n27\n9\nGuideline \u00b6 7. Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying\ninclude:\n(a) contact with a foreign family member, business or professional associate, friend, or other person\nwho is a citizen of or resident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign\nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and\n(d) sharing living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of citizenship status, if that\nrelationship creates a heightened risk of foreign inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion.\nThe Government produced substantial evidence of these two disqualifying conditions, and\nthe burden shifted to Applicant to produce evidence and prove a mitigating condition.  As previously\nindicated, the burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government.\nThree Foreign Influence Mitigating Conditions under Guideline \u00b6 8 are potentially applicable\nto these disqualifying conditions:\n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which these persons are\nlocated, or the positions or activities of those persons in that country are such that it is unlikely the\nindividual will be placed in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign\nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the U.S.;\n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual's sense of loyalty or obligation to the\nforeign person, group, government, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and\nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve\nany conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest;\n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and infrequent that there is little\nlikelihood that it could create a risk for foreign influence or exploitation.\n Guideline \u00b6 7 does not, by its express terms, exclude from consideration applicants with\nrelatives or associates in countries where terrorism has occurred, any more than it excludes persons\nfrom countries where there are foreign governments, foreign political organizations, or foreign non-\ngovernmental organizations.  Rather, it focuses on a very specific type of threat\u2013the risk of a foreign\npower exploiting an applicant\u2019s foreign relatives in such a way as to cause an applicant to act\nadversely to the interests of the United States.  The mere possession of close family ties with a\nperson in a foreign country is not, as a matter of law, disqualifying under Guideline B.  However,\nif only one relative lives in a foreign country, and an applicant has contacts with that relative, this\nfactor alone is sufficient to create the potential for foreign influence and could potentially result in\nthe compromise of classified information.   Applicant has no frequent contacts or a close\n27\nrelationship with his family.  He has seen one sister in the last five years.  He has no telephone\ncontact with them.  He owns no property in Afghanistan.  \nThe nature of a nation\u2019s government, its relationship with the United States, and its human\nrights record are relevant in assessing the likelihood that an applicant\u2019s family members are\n\nSee ISCR Case No. 02-13595 at 3 (App. Bd.

The risk of coercion, persuasion, or duress is significantly\ngreater if the foreign country has an authoritarian government, a family member is associated with\nor dependent upon the government, or the country is known to conduct intelligence operations\nagainst the United States.  The hostility of the Taliban, Al Qu\u2019aida, and other terrorist organizations\nin Afghanistan to the United States places a \u201cvery heavy burden of persuasion\u201d on Applicant to\ndemonstrate that his immediate family members in Afghanistan do not pose security risks and he is\nnot in a position to be forced to choose between loyalty to the United States and his family\nmembers.   With its adversarial stance and its dismal human rights record, it is conceivable that\n28\nthese forces in Afghanistan would target any citizen in an attempt to gather information from the\nUnited States.  The government of Afghanistan is, on the other hand, friendly to the U.S. and has\nbeen a partner in over-throwing the Taliban and Al Qu\u2019aida in Afghanistan.  \nThere is no evidence that Applicant\u2019s family are or have been political activists or journalists,\nchallenging the policies of the Afghan government. Likewise, there is no evidence that these\nrelatives work for the Afghan government or military or any news media.  There is no evidence that\nthe Afghan government has approached any of his Afghan family for any reason, and in particular,\nhas not approached them since his work for the military there in 2004 and 2005.  There is no\nevidence that his family living in Afghanistan engages in activities which would bring attention to\nthemselves or that they are even aware of his work.  As such, there is a reduced possibility that they\nwould be targets for coercion or exploitation by the Afghan government.\n \nGuideline \u00b6 8 (c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and infrequent\nthat there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign influence or exploitation applies\nbecause he has little or no contact with his family.   \nApplicant\u2019s statement about his loyalty to the United States is credible, and there is no reason\nto believe that he would take any action which could cause potential harm to his U.S. family or to\nthis country.  If the Afghan government should threaten harm to his family members living in\nAfghanistan to obtain classified information from him or otherwise contact him, I am persuaded that\nhe would report this activity to the U.S. authorities.  There is no evidence that he has failed to follow\nthe rules or failed to require those around him to do the same on projects requiring security\nclearances.  There is no evidence that he lacks the respect and trust of his employer, his friends, and\nfamily or that he lacks honesty and integrity.  There is no evidence that he has revealed to his family\nin Afghanistan the nature of his work or about applying for a security clearance. \nWhole Person Concept\nIn addition to the enumerated disqualifying and mitigating conditions as discussed\npreviously, I have considered the general adjudicative guidelines related to the whole person concept\nunder Directive \u00b6 E2.2.1.  The directive lists nine adjudicative process factors which are used for\n\u201cwhole person\u201d analysis.  Foreign influence and foreign preference do not involve misconduct,\nvoluntariness of participation, rehabilitation and behavior changes, etc.  Accordingly, the eighth\nadjudicative process factor is probably the most relevant.  Directive \u00b6 E2.2.1.8.  The eighth factor\n\nSee ISCR Case No. 02-24566 at 3 (App. Bd. July 17, 2006) (stating that an analysis under the eighth whole person\n29\nfactor apparently without discussion of the other factors was sustainable); ISCR Case No. 03-10954 at 5 (App. Bd. Mar.\n8, 2006) (sole whole person factor mentioned is eighth factor in discussion of Judge\u2019s whole person analysis for Iranian-\nAmerican\u2019s case).  \nCompare ISCR Case No. 03-23259 at 2 (App. Bd. May 10, 2006) (noting Judge did not assess \u201cthe realistic potential\n30\nfor exploitation\u201d but affirming denial of clearance based on contacts with Iranian family members); with ISCR Case No.\n03-17620 at 4 (App. Bd. Apr. 17, 2006) (remanding grant of clearance because Judge did not assess \u201cthe realistic\npotential for exploitation\u201d).\nSee ISCR Case No. 04-06242 at 2 (App. Bd. June 28, 2006).\n31\n11\nprovides, \u201cthe potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress.\u201d  Afghanistan\u2019s government\n29\nis not hostile to the United States but does not conform to widely accepted norms of human rights.\nApplicant has multiple family members who live in Afghanistan, but he has almost no contact with\nthem.  Under the circumstances, it is unlikely there would be significant possibility of pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation or duress.  \nAs indicated in the statement of facts, there are many other countervailing, positive attributes\nto Applicant\u2019s life as a U.S. citizen that weigh towards granting a clearance.  He is patriotic, loves\nthe United States, and would not permit Afghanistan to exploit him.  He has close ties to the United\nStates.  His closest family members are his wife and four children.  They are U.S citizens and live\nwith him.  Because his wife and children live in the United States, they are not vulnerable to coercion\nor exploitation by a foreign power, except possibly indirectly through relatives, who still live or visit\nAfghanistan.  He has lived in the United States 21 years.  He owns property in the United States.\nThe \u201cwhole person\u201d analysis in a Guideline B case should include \u201cthe totality of an applicant\u2019s\nconduct and circumstances (including the realistic potential for exploitation)\u201d as well as the eighth\nfactor discussed in the previous paragraph.   In this case, Applicant\u2019s potential for exploitation is\n30\nlow.  I base this finding on his credible and sincere testimony, and I do not believe he would\ncompromise national security, or otherwise comply with any Afghan threats.  After weighing the\ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions, all the facts and circumstances, in the context of the whole\nperson, I conclude Applicant has mitigated the security concerns pertaining to foreign influence.  \nBased on the Appeal Board\u2019s Guideline B jurisprudence pertaining to cases involving Afghan-\nAmericans, who have frequent contacts with family members living in Afghanistan, Applicant\u2019s\nsecurity eligibility and suitability can be approved.  I take this position based on the law, as set forth\nin Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988), my \u201ccareful consideration of the whole person\nfactors\u201d  and supporting evidence, my application of the pertinent factors under the Adjudicative\n31\nProcess, and my interpretation of my  responsibilities under Enclosure 2 of the Directive.  I conclude\nApplicant is eligible for access to classified information.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required\nby E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1.

He mitigated concerns as to two females friends in the PRC with\nwhom he cut all contact after obtaining his present employment. Clearance is denied. \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn April 18, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) pursuant to\nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry as amended and\nmodified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended and modified, issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the\npreliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. DOHA recommended the case be\nreferred to an administrative judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued,\ndenied, or revoked.\nIn a sworn written statement, dated May 2, 2007, Applicant responded to the allegations set\nforth in the SOR, and requested a hearing. The case was assigned to me on June 6, 2007. A Notice\nof Hearing was issued June 7, 2007, for a hearing held on June 25, 2007. The Government\nintroduced three exhibits at the hearing and requested that administrative notice be taken of 12\nofficial government documents. The Applicant introduced six exhibits at the hearing and one post-\nhearing submission (Exh. G). All exhibits were admitted into evidence and notice was taken of facts\nidentified in an administrative notice (AN) request. The Applicant testified on his own behalf. The\ntranscript was received on July 6, 2007. \nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant admitted all allegations under Foreign Influence (Guideline B) and all but one\nallegation under Foreign Preference (Guideline C) with explanations for all allegations. The\nadmissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a complete review of the evidence in\nthe record and upon due consideration of the record the following additional findings of fact are\nmade:\nApplicant is a-56-year-old employee of a major defense contractor working as a principal\nsoftware engineer since January 2006. Before his present employment, he worked in the telephone\nand communications industry (Tr. 66). He emigrated to the U.S. from the Republic of China\n(Taiwan) in 1986 after graduating from a private university in Taiwan with degrees in electrical\n\n3\nengineering and physics (Tr. 58). He pursued a graduate degree in the U.S. and obtained a Master\u2019s\ndegree in 1988. He became a U.S. citizen in 1996 and obtained a U.S. passport in 1997 (Tr. 20).\nBefore coming to the U.S. Applicant served a two year military tour as an artillery officer in\nTaiwan. He was also married and divorced in Taiwan. He has two brothers in Taiwan with whom\nhe has sporadic contact. One is a permanent resident of the U.S. but is a dentist in Taiwan. He saw\nhim briefly in 2006 when Applicant was en route to Thailand on a tour and contacts him by phone\nevery three years. The second brother is self-employed and he contacts him every six years. He has\na sister in Taiwan whose husband is a teacher and  moves often. She is a housewife but Applicant\nknows little about her. In the last 15 years he has seen her once and called her once (Tr. 24-36). \nApplicant met two women in the Peoples Republic of China (PRC) via the internet and\nvisited them in the PRC in 2005. He spent one day and evening with each of them and has had\noccasional contact with one of them since by e-mail. One works for a radio station and the other is\na graduate student. Since assuming his present employment in the defense industry, he has not been\nin contact with them (Tr. 40-44).\nApplicant traveled to Taiwan once each in 1994, 1996, 1999, and 2006. The trips were in\nconnection with other travels to the far east. He has traveled to the PRC once in 1995, twice in 1996,\nonce each in 1997 and 2000, three times in 2001 and once in 2005. The last one was after the\nissuance of the SOR. He used a Taiwan passport for the 1999 and 2006 trips (Exh. 2) but also used\nhis U.S. passport in 2006. All of the trips in 2001 and several of the others to the PRC were with tour\ngroups operated by a U.S. company (Tr. 59-61). The three 2001 trips occurred because his former\nemployer had work slow-downs and he had excessive leave to use. The trips were very inexpensive\nand this was a large motivation for taking the tours. \nApplicant holds a Taiwan passport which does not expire until 2015. Since the SOR raised\nsecurity concerns relating to the passport, he has turned it over to the security office of his employer.\nIt will be held by the company until Applicant no longer needs a security clearance (Exh. G). He has\na one third interest with his brothers in two family-owned apartments in Taiwan that will someday\nbe sold. He expects to inherit his share of the total value of the building estimated at between\n$160,000 and $180,000 (Tr. 51-52). To do so he will need to have a Taiwan passport and remain a\ndual citizen (Tr. 55). If he requests his Taiwan passport, such will be reported by his employer to the\nDefense Security Service. \nApplicant\u2019s salary is $95,000 per annum.. He has assets of over $1 million in the U.S.\nHe owns a condominium with no mortgage (Tr. 18). He has never had a security clearance and has\nnot had a desire to have one until it was suggested by his company (Tr. 64). He stated in his\ninterrogatory (Exh. 2 at p. 48) and his testimony (Tr. 64) that he only wanted to do unclassified work\nsince he traveled so much and did not want a classified job. He expressed some reluctance to have\none, except for the interest of his employer (Tr. 63-64).

See Executive Order No. 12968 \u00a7 3.1(b).\nCONCLUSION\nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all appropriate legal\nprecepts, factors and conditions above, I conclude the following with respect to all allegations set\nforth in the SOR: \nGuideline B-Foreign Influence\nConditions under Guideline B that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying\ninclude contact with a foreign family member who is a citizen of, or resident in a foreign country if\nthat contact creates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure or\ncoercion (AG \u00b6 7a). Based on the evidence of record, including Applicant\u2019s family members living\nabroad, the Government established a basis for concern over foreign influence. The Applicant has\nthe burden to establish security suitability through evidence which refutes, mitigates, or extenuates\nthe disqualification and demonstrates that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant\na security clearance. ISCR Case No. 99-0424 (App. Bd. Feb. 8, 2001).\nBy virtue of the relationships of the foreign family members, Applicant\u2019s contacts, though\ninfrequent, cannot be deemed casual. The fact that some relatives live in Taiwan and the history of\nthat country as to its efforts in acquisition of economic and military information makes it of security\nconcern. Mitigating conditions (MC) that might be applicable are a determination that the nature of\nthe relationships with foreign persons, the country in which the persons are located, or the positions\nor activities of those persons in that country are such that is unlikely the individual will be placed\n\n5\nin a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual group or government\nand the interests of the U.S. (AG \u00b6 8a).\nThe government stated at the hearing that the allegation in the SOR that Applicant\u2019s brothers\nwere of lesser concern to those of the sister about whom little is known except that he has had the\nleast contact with her of any of his siblings. The citizenship and residence of Applicant\u2019s siblings\nand Applicant\u2019s extensive travels to the PRC and Taiwan in the 1990's continuing until 2006 (Tr.\n77-79) raises security concerns. Those concerns are compounded by his use of the Taiwan  passport\nin 1999 and 2006 after he obtained a U.S. passport. The fact that his siblings are living in Taiwan\nraises a question of the risk of pressure that might be brought on him notwithstanding the limited\ncontact he has with all three. The government conceded that the concerns relating to the female\nacquaintances in the PRC were lessened by virtue of minimal contact with them and complete\ncessation of contact once he started work in the defense industry. Thus, I conclude in his favor with\nregard to the two friends in the PRC but not as to his siblings in Taiwan. \nGuideline C: Foreign Preference \nThe applicable guidelines for Foreign Preference Guideline C provide that an individual who\nacts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a foreign country over the United States may be\nprone to provide information or make decisions that are harmful to the interests of the United States\n(AG \u00b6 9). Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include the\npossession of a current foreign passport and exercise the privileges of foreign citizenship (AG \u00b6 10a\n1). \nSecurity concerns may be mitigated by a providing evidence that the passport has been\ndestroyed, surrendered to the cognizant security authority, or otherwise invalidated (AG \u00b6 11e).\nApplicant used his Taiwan passport for two trips to Taiwan in 1999 and 2006 after he obtained a\nU.S. passport. He also used the U.S. passport for the December 2006 trip. He used the U.S. passport,\nprimarily to avoid payment of visa fees. I conclude from the evidence submitted showing that the\npassport has been turned over to his corporate security office, that the allegations under Guideline\nC of possession of the passport (SOR \u00b6 2.a.) has been mitigated but not as to the use of the foreign\npassport (SOR \u00b6 2.b.).\nWhole Person Analysis\nIn all adjudications the protection of our national security is of paramount concern. Persons\nwho have access to classified information have an overriding responsibility for the security of the\nnation. The objective of the security clearance process is the fair-minded, commonsense assessment\nof a person\u2019s trustworthiness and fitness for access to classified information. The \u201cwhole person\u201d\nconcept recognizes that we should view a person by the totality of their acts and omissions. Each\ncase must be judged on its own merits taking into consideration all relevant circumstances, and\napplying sound judgment, mature thinking, and careful analysis.\nApplicant is a well-educated engineer who is doing an excellent job for his company (Exh.\nB). He provided sincere and credible testimony as to his relationship with his siblings, his\nmotivations, and his loyalty to the U.S. He has established a successful life building financial and\neducational ties to the U.S. He has a strong financial stake in the U.S. His contacts with his family\n\n6\nliving abroad are minimal. He has no deference to or loyalty to his country of origin.\nThere is evidence that Taiwan has engaged in economic and military espionage, and that the\nPRC seeks to use it as a source for information as shown in the official documents of which I have\ntaken administrative notice (AN I and IX). However, efforts of the U.S. have been consistently in\nsupport of Taiwan\u2019s democratically elected government (Exh. II). The PRC is an acknowledged\ncollector of military and defense information and this is a matter of concern to the U.S. as illustrated\nin the documents (AN IX, X, and XI). There is also evidence of human rights violations in the PRC\nabout which the U.S. is concerned. \nWhile Applicant has now spent over 20 years in the U.S. and has substantial investments in\nthe U.S., he has a contingent financial interest in his family property in Taiwan. His large number\nof trips to the PRC and Taiwan as recently as December 2006 after going to work in the defense\nindustry shows a continued interest in both Taiwan and the PRC.\nApplicant has never held a security clearance before and expressed no great interest in having\none. Thus, he had little occasion to develop particular knowledge of security requirements. While\nthere is no indication that he is anything but a loyal U.S. citizen, it is premature to grant a clearance\nuntil more time has elapsed between the time of his travels and the filing of an application for a\nsecurity clearance. \nAfter considering all the evidence in its totality and as an integrated whole to focus on the\nwhole person of Applicant, I conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to\ngrant clearance to Applicant at this time. Clearance is denied. \nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal Findings as required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive are hereby\nrendered as follows:\nParagraph l Guideline B: \nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a.:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b.:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c.:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e.:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f.:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2 Guideline C: \nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a.:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b.:\nAgainst Applicant\nDECISION\n\n7\nAfter full consideration of all the facts and documents presented by the record in this case,\nit is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for\nApplicant. Clearance is denied. \nCharles D. Ablard \nAdministrative Judge\n",

Applicant appealed pursuant to the\nDirective \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.1\nApplicant\u2019s appeal brief contains no assertion of harmful error on the part of the Judge.\nRather, it contains new evidence, in the form of a statement from the Applicant, which updates his\nfinancial situation and indicates that since the hearing he has paid off \u201cthree of [his] biggest debts.\u201d2\nApplicant also requests that the Board grant him a clearance based upon the favorable evidence in\nthe case including his 21 years of honorable service in the Navy.

In support of his requests Applicant states that without\nhis clearance he will be unable to work and get his debts paid off.\nThe Board cannot consider Applicant\u2019s new evidence on appeal.

Although he had some circumstances beyond\nhis control and has made some effort to repay his debts, he did not present sufficient evidence to\nmitigate the financial considerations security concern. Eligibility for a security clearance is denied.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nApplicant contests the Defense Department\u2019s intent to deny or revoke his eligibility for a\nsecurity clearance. Acting under the relevant Executive Order and DoD Directive,  the Defense\n1\nOffice of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a statement of reasons (SOR) to Applicant on April\n2, 2007. The SOR\u2014which is equivalent to an administrative complaint\u2014details the factual basis for\nthe action and alleges a security concern under Guideline F for financial considerations based on\ndelinquent indebtedness. \nIn addition to the Directive, this case is brought under the revised Adjudicative Guidelines\nfor Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information (Revised Guidelines) approved by\nthe President on December 29, 2005. The Revised Guidelines were then modified by the Defense\nDepartment, effective September 1, 2006. They supersede or replace the guidelines published in\nEnclosure 2 to the Directive. They apply to all adjudications and other determinations where an SOR\nhas been issued on September 1, 2006, or thereafter.  The Directive is pending revision or\n2\namendment. The Revised Guidelines apply here because the SOR is dated after the effective date.\nOn May 22, 2007, Applicant replied to the SOR and requested a hearing. The hearing took\nplace as scheduled on August 9, 2007, and the transcript was received on August 23, 2007.\nThe record was kept open until August 23  to allow Applicant to submit additional\nrd\ndocumentary evidence. Applicant made a timely submission consisting of a one-page letter, which\nwas forwarded to me by department counsel who voiced no objections. The letter is marked and\nadmitted as Exhibit G.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nThe SOR alleges 16 delinquent debts for about $22,500 in total. Applicant admitted all\nindebtedness (except for SOR subparagraph 1.l) in his reply to the SOR. He indicated that he was\n\n3\nuncertain if subparagraph 1.l was his debt, and that he had paid the debts in subparagraphs 1.h, 1.i,\nand 1.k. In addition to his admissions and explanations, the following facts are established. \nApplicant is a 45-year-old outside machinist working for a contractor that provides services\nto the U.S. Navy. His job involves working on submarines. His supervisor describes Applicant as\nan exceptional employee (Exhibit A). He has held a security clearance for many years as a sailor and\na civilian employee. He is seeking to retain a security clearance for his current employment. \nFrom 1980 to 2001, Applicant served on active duty in the Navy as a torpedoman. He retired\nin June 2001 as a petty officer first class (paygrade E-6). His military retirement pay is about $1,200\nper month after deductions. \nApplicant has been married twice. He first married in 1984 and divorced in 1993. He married\nhis current wife in 1993. Applicant and his current wife separated and lived apart from about May\n2003 to sometime in early 2006, approximately three years (R. 62\u201363). During this time, Applicant\nwas trying to support two households and pay child support to his ex-wife. \nHe has four children, ages 23, 22, 19, and 14. The oldest is a stepdaughter. His 14-year-old\nson is the only child living in his household. Applicant is no longer paying chid support to his ex-\nwife for the other two children. He made the last child-support payment in July 2007 when his son\nreached the age of 19 (R. 63\u201364).  \nApplicant has a history of financial problems. For example, a credit report from November\n2005 reflects 30 accounts in the trade section of the report of which 8 accounts were listed in a\ncollection or past-due status (Exhibit 5). The collections section of the report lists eight accounts.\nApplicant provided documentary proof of his efforts to pay or resolve the debts in the SOR.\nHis efforts are summarized in the following table.\nDebt Description\nCurrent Status\nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a\u20131.d, medical accounts for $189,\n$38, $50, and $166.\nUnpaid.\nSOR \u00b6 1.e, telephone account for $707.\nUnpaid.\nSOR \u00b6 1.f, real estate account (apartment\nrent) for $609.\nUnpaid.\nSOR \u00b6 1.g, hospital account for $50.\nUnpaid. \nSOR \u00b6 1.h, hospital account for $191.\nUnpaid. \nSOR \u00b6 1.I, collection account for $545.\nPaid in Oct. 2006 (Exhibit G).\nSOR \u00b6 1.j, collection account for $6,788.\nRepayment agreement\u2013to pay $100 monthly\nsoon.\nSOR \u00b6 1.k, electric account for $50.\nPaid in Apr. 2007.\n\n Department of Navy v.

To the extent he is disputing any of\nthe debts as duplicates, he did not provide documentary proof to substantiate the basis of his claims.\nIn addition to the delinquent debts in the SOR, Applicant is indebted to the IRS for tax years\n2004 and 2005. Also, he believes he will owe money for tax year 2006 as he just recently filed his\nreturn. He estimates an $8,000 balance for 2004\u20132005 and a $3,000 balance for 2006. He has a\nrepayment agreement with the IRS. He recently increased the IRS monthly payment from $200 to\n$265. He believes the tax debt was caused by insufficient withholding from his retirement pay. \nApplicant has not been unemployed since his retirement from the Navy in 2001. Including\nhis retirement pay, he estimates earning a gross annual income of $64,000 in 2006. He has not had\nany financial, credit, and tax counseling. \nApplicant started falling behind in 2003 when he and his current wife separated (R. 58\u201359).\nAlso, from September 2003 to April 2004, Applicant had a job where he earned less money. Along\nwith this period of underemployment,  he  \u201cjust let it go\u201d (R. 64). He was not smart about how he\nhandled the situation and it got away from him when he did not act. He anticipates having an extra\n$400 to make debt payments when he pays off a car loan in September 2007 (R. 27). His credit union\ndenied his request for a debt-consolidation loan (R. 27\u201328). \nGENERAL PRINCIPLES OF LAW AND POLICIES\nNo one has a right to a security clearance.

An unfavorable decision: (1) denies any application; (2)  revokes any existing security\n5\nclearance; and (3) prevents access to classified information at any level and retention of any existing\nsecurity clearance.  Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive, any doubt about whether\n6\nan applicant should be allowed access to classified information will be resolved in favor of\nprotecting national security.\nThere is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for access\nto classified information.  The government has the burden of presenting evidence to establish facts\n7\nalleged in the SOR that have been controverted.  An applicant is responsible for presenting evidence\n8\nto refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts that have been admitted or proven.  In addition, an\n9\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.  In Egan,\n10\nthe Supreme Court said that the burden of proof is less than the preponderance of the evidence.  The\n11\nagency appellate authority has followed the Court\u2019s reasoning, and a judge\u2019s findings of fact are\nreviewed under the substantial-evidence standard.12\nThe Revised Guidelines set forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when evaluating a\nperson\u2019s security clearance eligibility, including disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating\nconditions (MC) for each guideline. In addition, each clearance decision must be a fair and impartial\ncommonsense decision based upon consideration of all the relevant and material information, the\npertinent criteria and adjudication factors, and the whole-person concept. A person granted access\nto classified information enters into a special relationship with the government. The government\nmust be able to have a high degree of trust and confidence in those persons to whom it grants access\nto classified information. The decision to deny a person a security clearance is not a determination\nof an applicant\u2019s loyalty.  Instead, it is a determination that the applicant has not met the strict\n13\nguidelines the President has established for granting eligibility for a security clearance.\nCONCLUSIONS\n\n Revised Guidelines at 13\u201314 (setting forth the disqualifying and mitigating conditions). \n14\n Revised Guidelines at 13. \n15\n DC 1 is \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts.\u201d \n16\n DC 3 is \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d \n17\n MC 2 is \u201cthe conditions that resulted in the financial problems were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g.,\n18\nloss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the\nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances.\u201d \n MC 4 is \u201cthe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.\u201d\n19\n6\nUnder Guideline F for financial considerations,  a security concern typically exists due to\n14\nsignificant unpaid debts. \u201cFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by\nrules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability,\ntrustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information.\u201d  Similarly, an individual who is\n15\nfinancially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, unconcerned, negligent, or careless in properly\nhandling and safeguarding classified information.   \nThe record evidence supports a conclusion that Applicant has a history of financial problems.\nHis history of financial problems is a security concern because it indicates inability or unwillingness\nto satisfy debts  and a history of not meeting financial obligations  within the meaning of Guideline\n16\n17\nF. The record evidence is more than sufficient to establish these two disqualifying conditions. \nApplicant receives some credit in mitigation. The most pertinent mitigating conditions are\nthe second MC  and the fourth MC  of Guideline F. The second does not apply, while the fourth\n18\n19\napplies in part. \nApplicant experienced financial problems beginning in 2003 to date. During this time, he was\nseparated from his second wife and making child-support payments from his first marriage. Also,\nhe was underemployed during part of this period. Together, these circumstances no doubt put\nincreased pressure on Applicant\u2019s obligations to his family and to his creditors. MC 2 does not apply,\nhowever, because Applicant did not act responsibly when he just let things go, a decision that had\nthe predictable consequence of making a bad situation worse.\nBut Applicant does receive some credit in mitigation under MC 4, because he has made a\ngood-faith effort to repay several of the debts. The credit is limited, however, because his efforts\nhave been uneven (see table). What is missing here is a realistic, comprehensive plan that addresses\nall the Applicant\u2019s indebtedness. \nIn addition, most of the repayment agreements are recent developments, and it is too soon\nto tell if Applicant will honor the agreements by making the scheduled payments. Aggravating the\nsituation is Applicant\u2019s tax debt to the IRS. He owes more than $10,000 for three tax years, a\ncircumstance that may limit his ability to repay the other debts. Also, it indicates that Applicant\u2019s\nfinancial problems are far from over and likely to continue or recur.     \n\n7\nTo conclude, Applicant did not present sufficient evidence to explain, extenuate, or mitigate\nthe financial considerations security concern. Although he did present some favorable evidence, it\nis insufficient to outweigh his history of financial problems. Applicant did not meet his ultimate\nburden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision. In reaching this conclusion, the whole-\nperson concept was given due consideration and that analysis does not support a favorable decision.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nSOR \u00b6 1\u2013Guideline F:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraphs a\u2013p:\nFor Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant\nor continue a security clearance for Applicant.

Transcript at 5-6. \n2\nbasis for that decision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant\nrequested a hearing.  On January 18, 2008, after the hearing, Administrative Judge Michael H.\nLeonard denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant timely appealed pursuant to\nthe Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether Applicant was denied due process.\nApplicant essentially contends he was denied due process.  In that regard, he argues that\nDepartment Counsel led him to believe that an attorney would be present at the hearing to represent\nhim.  Applicant also argues that even though he elected to proceed on his own, he was somewhat\nintimidated by the situation and did not present as much mitigating evidence as he could have.\nTherefore, Applicant requests that the case be remanded for a new hearing.  The Board does not find\nApplicant\u2019s arguments persuasive.\nThere is a rebuttable presumption that federal officials and employees carry out their duties\nin good faith.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 00-0030 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 20, 2001).  A party seeking to\nrebut that presumption has a heavy burden of persuasion on appeal.  Applicant has not met that\nheavy burden.  Applicant fails to identify anything in the record below that indicates or suggests a\nbasis for a reasonable person to conclude that Department Counsel acted improperly, unfairly or\nunprofessionally.  See, e.g, ISCR Case No. 05-04923 at 3, n. 4 (App. Bd. Apr. 24, 2007); ISCR Case\nNo. 03-21329 at 2 (App. Bd. Sep. 25, 2006).\nDOHA proceedings are civil in nature and applicants are not entitled to the procedural\nprotections afforded to criminal defendants.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 02-12199 at 5-6 (App. Bd.\nOct. 7, 2004).  Therefore, claims of ineffective assistance of counsel are of no moment.  See, e.g.,\nISCR Case No. 02-17574 at 2 (App. Bd. Jul. 24, 2006).  A review of the record indicates that\nApplicant was provided with the procedural rights set forth in Executive Order 10865 and the\nDirective, as well as prehearing guidance (which advised that Applicant could appear by himself,\nwith an attorney he selected and paid for, or with a personal representative).  At the beginning of the\nhearing, the Judge diligently inquired into Applicant\u2019s understanding of his right to retain an\nattorney, and his willingness to represent himself at the hearing.   Based upon the representations he\n1\nreceived from Applicant, the Judge reasonably concluded that Applicant was making a knowing and\nintelligent waiver of his right to counsel, and was ready and willing to proceed with the hearing. See,\ne.g., ISCR Case No. 02-17574 at 2 (App. Bd. Jul. 24, 2006); compare ISCR Case No. 04-12732 at\n8 (App. Bd. Nov. 2, 2006).  During the hearing Applicant gave a coherent explanation about his\n\n3\nsituation, offered a documentary exhibit on his own behalf, answered questions appropriately, and\ndid not otherwise impose any objections to the proceedings.  Although pro se applicants cannot be\nexpected to act like lawyers, they are expected to take timely, reasonable steps to protect their rights\nunder the Directive. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 00-0593 at 4 (App. Bd. May 14, 2001).  If they fail to\ntake such steps, that failure to act does not constitute a denial of their rights.  See, e.g., ISCR Case\nNo. 02-19896 at 6 (App. Bd. Dec. 29, 2001).  Because Applicant did not object to proceeding or\notherwise request a continuance of his case, he was not denied due process under the Directive or\nExecutive Order.\nOrder\nThe decision of the Judge denying Applicant a security clearance is AFFIRMED.\nSigned: Michael Y.

Acting under the relevant Executive Order\nand DoD Directive,  the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\n1\nstatement of reasons (SOR) to Applicant on June 14, 2007. The SOR is equivalent to\nan administrative complaint and it details the factual basis for the action. The issues in\nthis case fall under Guideline F for financial considerations based on a history of\nfinancial problems as evidenced by delinquent debts.   \nIn addition, this case is brought under the revised Adjudicative Guidelines for\nDetermining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information (Revised Guidelines)\napproved by the President on December 29, 2005. The Revised Guidelines were then\nmodified by the Defense Department, effective September 1, 2006. They supersede or\nreplace the guidelines published in Enclosure 2 to the Directive. They apply to all\nJanuary 18, 2008\n\n  See Memorandum from the Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence, dated August 30, 2006, Subject:\n2\nImplementation of Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information\n(December 29, 2005). \n2\nadjudications and other determinations where an SOR has been issued on September\n1, 2006, or thereafter.  The Directive is pending revision or amendment. The Revised\n2\nGuidelines apply here because the SOR is dated after the effective date.  \nApplicant replied to the SOR on October 3, 2007, and did not request a hearing.\nDepartment counsel exercised its prerogative under the Directive and requested a\nhearing on October 22, 2007. The case was assigned to me on November 9, 2007. The\nhearing took place as scheduled on December 19, 2007, and the transcript (Tr.) was\nreceived on January 2, 2008.\nThe record was left open until December 31, 2007, to allow Applicant an\nopportunity to submit documentary evidence in addition to Applicant\u2019s Exhibits A and B.\nNo such matters were received and the record closed on December 31, 2007. For the\nreasons discussed below, this case is decided against Applicant. \nProcedural Rulings\nThe SOR was amended to correct the spelling of Applicant\u2019s first name.\nOtherwise, there were no procedural or other issues raised by the parties. \nFindings of Fact\nUnder Guideline F, the SOR alleges ten delinquent debts ranging from $99 to\n$13,812 for about $41,0000 in total. The ten debts consist of two judgments, one\ncharged-off account, and seven collection accounts. His response to the SOR is mixed,\nadmitting eight and denying two of the debts. Also, he contended that two of the debts\nwere duplicates. Based on the record evidence as a whole, the following facts are\nestablished by substantial evidence.\nApplicant is a 33-year-old systems analyst. He has worked for his current\nemployer since February 2000. His day-to-day duties consist of writing software and\ndelivering software packages across a network, including a classified network. His\ncurrent annual salary is about $50,000. Recent performance evaluations show Applicant\nperforms his duties well (Exhibit A). He is seeking to retain a security clearance\npreviously granted to him by the Defense Department.    \nApplicant has been married twice. His first marriage ended in divorce. He married\nhis current wife in 2002. There were no children from his first marriage, but he now has\na 4-year-old son and he recently adopted his wife\u2019s 11-year-old son. \nHis wife worked in sales until she was laid off in about October 2002. Other than\nsome seasonal and periodic employment, none of which lasted more than about 90\n\n3\ndays, she was unemployed until about November 2007 when she was hired as a county\ncorrections officer. She is in training and her wages will increase when she completes\nthe training course and assumes full duties. Her unemployment starting in 2002 reduced\ntheir household income and resulted in many financial problems.\nApplicant has a history of financial problems as evidenced by two unpaid\njudgments, the charged-off account, and the seven collection accounts. The debts\nalleged in the SOR, except as noted below, are established by credit reports (Exhibits 2,\n3, and 4). None of these debts have been paid, settled, or otherwise resolved.\nApplicant denies two debts. The first denial is to a $277 medical collection\naccount alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.d. He denies this debt because it should have been paid\nthrough his health insurance. This debt is not established by any of the three credit\nreports. One credit report shows an unpaid medical collection account reported in\nDecember 2006 for $571 (Exhibit 2 at 2). Given this inconsistency, the evidence is not\nsufficient to establish the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.d. \nThe other denial is to a $99 collection account based on cable TV services\nalleged in SOR \u00b6 1.f. He denies this debt because he currently receives services from\nthe same company and the account is current. He is unaware if this debt stems from\nliving at a previous residence. He presented no documentary information on this debt.\nThe debt is established by all three credit reports, and this evidence is sufficient to\nestablish the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.f. \nApplicant contends the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b are duplicates and the same\ngoes for the debts in \u00b6\u00b6 1.e and 1.h. Review of the three credit reports shows that the\ndebts in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b are separate judgments for different amounts taken by different\nparties. Likewise, review of the credit reports shows that the debts in \u00b6\u00b6 1.e and 1.h are\nseparate debts. Applicant did not present any documentary information to contradict or\nrebut the credit reports. Accordingly, these matters are considered separate debts. \nApplicant has not obtained any financial or credit counseling. He and his wife\nhave read and are using a book to repair their credit. He had no financial obligations\nstemming from his divorce. His rent, car payment, telephone, and utilities are current.\nLikewise, all other recurring monthly expenses are current. Neither he nor his wife use\ncredit cards. They manage their money and bill paying by using a debit card and online\nbanking. His wife takes care of the day-to-day money-management responsibilities.\nEssentially, they live paycheck-to-paycheck and this has been the situation since his\nwife lost her job in 2002. Their financial situation is starting to improve based on his\nwife\u2019s recent employment. They have about $1,000 in a savings account. Applicant has\na 401(k) account at work and contributes about 3% each pay period. He is unaware of\nthe account\u2019s balance. \nApplicant\u2019s employment history includes military service. He enlisted in the Army\nin 1992 after graduating from high school (Exhibit B). Initially, he was trained as a\ncavalry scout and he served with a prestigious airborne division. Thereafter, he\n\n Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988) (\u201cit should be obvious that no one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a\n3\nsecurity clearance\u201d); Duane v.

In\naddition, he served about three years in a state national guard until his medical\ndischarge due to back problems, and he received an honorable discharge.\nPolicies\nThis section sets forth the general principles of law and policies that apply to an\nindustrial security clearance case. To start, no one has a right to a security clearance.3\nAs noted by the Supreme Court in 1988 in the case of Department of Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe\nclearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if\nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d  A favorable decision establishes eligibility of an\n4\napplicant to be granted a security clearance for access to confidential, secret, or top-\nsecret information.  An unfavorable decision (1) denies any application, (2)  revokes any\n5\nexisting security clearance, and (3) prevents access to classified information at any\nlevel.  Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive, any doubt about whether\n6\nan applicant should be allowed access to classified information will be resolved in favor\nof protecting national security.\nThere is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for\naccess to classified information.  The government has the burden of presenting\n7\nevidence to establish facts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted.  An\n8\napplicant is responsible for presenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate\nfacts that have been admitted or proven.  In addition, an applicant has the ultimate\n9\nburden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.  In Egan, the Supreme\n10\n\n Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n11\n ISCR Case No. 01-20700 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002) (citations omitted).\n12\n Executive Order 10865, \u00a7 7.\n13\n Revised Guidelines at pp. 13\u201314 (setting forth the disqualifying and mitigating conditions). \n14\n Revised Guidelines at p. 13. \n15\n DC 1 is \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts.\u201d \n16\n DC 3 is \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d \n17\n5\nCourt stated that the burden of proof is less than a preponderance of the evidence.11\nThe agency appellate authority has followed the Court\u2019s reasoning, and a judge\u2019s\nfindings of fact are reviewed under the substantial-evidence standard.12\nThe Revised Guidelines set forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when\nevaluating a person\u2019s security clearance eligibility, including disqualifying conditions\n(DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) for each guideline. In addition, each clearance\ndecision must be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based upon consideration\nof all the relevant and material information, the pertinent criteria and adjudication\nfactors, and the whole-person concept. A person granted access to classified\ninformation enters into a special relationship with the government. The government\nmust be able to have a high degree of trust and confidence in those persons to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. The decision to deny a person a security\nclearance is not a determination of an applicant\u2019s loyalty.  Instead, it is a determination\n13\nthat the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President has established for\ngranting eligibility for a security clearance.\nAnalysis\nUnder Guideline F for financial considerations,  a security concern typically\n14\nexists due to significant unpaid debts. \u201cFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means,\nsatisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of\njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified\ninformation.\u201d  Similarly, an individual who is financially irresponsible may also be\n15\nirresponsible, unconcerned, negligent, or careless in properly handling and\nsafeguarding classified information.   \nThe record evidence supports a conclusion that Applicant has a history of\nfinancial problems. His history of financial problems is a security concern because it\nindicates inability to satisfy debts  and a history of not meeting financial obligations\n16\n17\nwithin the meaning of Guideline F. The record evidence is more than sufficient to\nestablish these two disqualifying conditions, which raise a security concern.\n\n MC 2 is \u201cthe conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person's control (e.g.,\n18\nloss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation),\nand the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.\u201d\n MC 4 is \u201cthe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.\u201d\n19\n6\nAll of the mitigating conditions under Guideline F have been considered and two\ndeserve \ndiscussion. \nFirst, \nMC \n2\u2014conditions \nlargely \nbeyond \na \nperson\u2019s\ncontrol\u2014applies.  Obviously, the unemployment from Applicant\u2019s wife from October\n18\n2002 until November 2007 (except for some seasonal and periodic work) resulted in\nloss of income and was the primary cause of the financial problems. Likewise, it\nappears Applicant acted reasonably under the circumstances because he did the best\nhe could with the limited income available to him. Given these circumstances, Applicant\nreceives some credit in mitigation under MC 2.  \nSecond, a potential mitigating condition is MC 4, which requires a person to\ninitiate a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.19\nApplicant has made few efforts to resolve the delinquent debts. Other than reading the\ncredit-repair book, Applicant has not made any real progress. Given these\ncircumstances, in light of the  unaddressed delinquent debts, his efforts do not amount\nto a good-faith effort within the meaning of the guideline. Something more is required. \nApplicant is 33 years old and sufficiently mature to make prudent decisions about\nhis finances. Although his intent to resolve his financial problems appears to be\ngenuine, he has done little so far to demonstrate his intent. What is missing here is (1) a\nrealistic and workable plan to clean up his financial house, (2) documented actions\ntaken in furtherance of the plan, and (3) a measurable improvement to the situation.\nGiven the current circumstances, it is likely that the financial problems will continue or\nrecur because Applicant is facing substantial financial problems, starting with the two\nunpaid judgments for more than $18,000.  \nTo conclude, Applicant did not present sufficient evidence to explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate the financial considerations security concern. Applicant did not meet his\nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision. In reaching this\nconclusion, the whole-person concept was given due consideration and that analysis\ndoes not support a favorable decision. In this regard, I gave weight to Applicant\u2019s\nhonorable military service, his history of holding a security clearance without an adverse\nincident, and his favorable work history. Nevertheless, these matters were not sufficient\nto change the outcome. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\n\n7\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.a\u20131j (except 1.d) \nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nFor Applicant \nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with national interest\nto grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance.

The record evidence is sufficient to mitigate or\nextenuate the negative security implications stemming Applicant\u2019s conduct. Clearance is granted.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn January 30, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant stating that DOHA could not make the preliminary\naffirmative finding  it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security\n1\nclearance for Applicant. The SOR set forth reasons why a security clearance could not be granted\nor continued due to alcohol consumption, personal conduct, and criminal conduct security concerns.\nOn June 16, 2007, Applicant answered the SOR and requested a hearing. On July 23, 2007,\nI was assigned the case. On August 11, 2007, a Notice of Hearing was issued for the hearing held\non August 30, 2007. At the hearing, the Government presented three exhibits (Gov Ex 1-3).\nApplicant testified and submitted six exhibits (App Ex A-F). On September 12, 2007, DOHA\nreceived the transcript (Tr.). The record was kept open to allow Applicant to submit additional\ndocuments, which were received on September 10, 2007.  Department Counsel having no objections,\nthe documents were admitted into evidence as App Ex G. \nFINDINGS OF FACT\nThe SOR alleges security concerns for alcohol consumption, personal conduct, and criminal\nconduct. Applicant admitted he was arrested in October 2005 and charged with actual physical\ncontrol (ACP) of a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol, for which he received a two-\nyear deferred sentence, paid a $200 fine, and performed 20 hours of community service.  Applicant\nadmits he was arrested in January 2004 for noise violation and received a fine.  The admissions are\nincorporated herein as findings of fact. After a thorough review of the record, I make the following\nfindings of fact.\nApplicant is a 44-year-old lead analyst and assistant equipment control officer, who has\nworked for a defense contractor since December 2005 and is seeking to obtain a security clearance.\nApplicant is regarded by those who know him as a selfless, likeable person, honest, hard working,\nprofessional, organized, efficient, competent, dependable, and security conscious. Numerous\ncoworkers and acquaintances mention Applicant\u2019s dedication. (App Ex G) Applicant\u2019s girlfriend\nbelieves him to be honest, kind, gentle, an excellent parent, a role-model for her son, and an\nhonorable man. She says Applicant had made mistakes, but never denied making them. Once\nmistakes were made, Applicant made the necessary changes not to compromise the positive aspects\nin his life. (App Ex G) Applicant\u2019s ex-wife states he is a hard working, good person, a great father,\nand a productive member of society who has already been punished for his mistakes. \nApplicant entered the Air Force in May 1984.  In May 1999, he was a staff sergeant with 15\nyears in the Air Force. Applicant\u2019s work performance was outstanding. (App Ex C)  Applicant and\n\n3\nhis wife were experiencing marital problems.  His wife had told him she wanted a divorce and, in\nApril 1999, she had returned to England, her home, taking their daughter with her. (Tr. 38)\nApplicant met a 22-year-old female airman who was just arriving at her first duty assignment\nand was joining Applicant\u2019s unit. She showed him attention while he was showing her around the\nbase, took her to softball practice, showed her around the area, and acted in place of her sponsor.\n(Tr. 39, 44) The airman was in an introductory course, but was scheduled to come to Applicant\u2019s\nshop, which would have made him her supervisor. (Tr. 65) The Air Force has rules against\nunprofessional relationships.  An NCO should not have a relationship, in particular a sexual\nrelationship, with an airman under their supervision. \nOn a Friday night two weeks after the met, in May 1999, exactly 15 years to the day on\nwhich he had entered the service, the woman asked Applicant to come over and bring some alcohol\nwith him. (Tr. 45) Applicant and the woman were drinking Jack Daniels and coke and she began\ndrinking directly from the bottle. Applicant attempted to stop her from doing so. (Tr. 71)  The two\nstarted to have sexual relations. She continued to drink heavily to the point she passed out.  At that\ntime, Applicant stopped having sex.  Applicant and the woman had had sexual relations on two prior\noccasions. (Tr. 87) \nApplicant spent the night.  When they woke together the next morning, Applicant asked if\nshe remembered what had happened the previous night.  She said no, at which time, Applicant told\nher what occurred to which she was in disbelief and stated she could not believe it had happened\nagain. (Tr. 46)  She expressed she had drunk too much and slept with a married captain at tech\nschool. The woman and Applicant then went out to breakfast. Later that day, in the afternoon, the\nwoman called him, and asked him to come over. When he arrived, she proceeded to take a shower.\n(Tr. 88) They then talked about dinner, went to dinner, and the woman paid for dinner. The\nfollowing day, the woman accused Applicant of rape. \nIn August 1999, following a three-month investigation by the Office of Special Investigation\n(OSI), Applicant received punishment under Article 15 of the Uniformed Code of Military Justice\n(UCMJ) not for rape, but for violation of Article 92, (failure to obey an order or regulation), and\nviolation of Article 134, the general article, (for acts prejudice to good order and discipline in the\narmed forces and/or a breach of custom of the service).  The OSI could not state the sexual relations\nwere not consensual.  He was reduced in grade from E-5 to E-4 and forfeited $500 per month for\ntwo months which was suspended.  He was also reprimanded for engaging in sexual intercourse with\nsomeone under his direct supervision aggravated by the fact Applicant was married at the time. \nIn May 2000, Applicant\u2019s commander denied his reenlistment application. (App Ex B)  The\naction was appealed and in October 2000, the Director of Personnel directed Applicant be allowed\nto reenlist.  The Director had reviewed the matter and was convinced the reenlistment denial was\nnot warranted. (App Ex C)  Applicant stayed on active duty and in October 2002 was promoted to\nE-5. (App Ex F) In April 2004, Applicant completed 20 years of service and received an honorable\ndischarge.  He was prevented from remaining in the Air Force longer due to his rank.  In order to\nremain on active duty after 20 years an individual must be at or above the grade of E-6. \nIn January 2004, Applicant was in his apartment with a friend listening to music. An off-duty\ncity police officer came by to tell Applicant to turn off his music.  The officer was a resident of and\nemployed by the apartment complex as a security officer, for which the officer received his\n\n4\napartment free of charge or at a reduced rate. (Tr. 33) Applicant and the officer got into a discussion\nabout whether the music should be simply turned down or turned off.  Applicant expressed his\nwillingness to turn down the music, but could not be required to turn off the music in his own\napartment. (Tr. 34) Applicant turned down the music in the officer\u2019s presence and shut the patio\ndoor, which had been opened.\nA coworker, a service member, present at the time, (App Ex g) states Applicant complied\nwith everything asked of him by the off-duty officer except turning the music off. Five or ten\nminutes later, three on-duty police officers arrived.  After being let into the apartment, the three\ntackled Applicant, handcuffed him, and arrested Applicant for noise violation. (Tr.35App Ex G)\nWhen his friend asked if throwing him to the ground and handcuffing Applicant was necessary, the\nservice member was told to shut up and stay out of it or he too would be arrested. Applicant spent\nthe remainder of the night in jail. \nApplicant has learned to do what the police say. If told by someone in authority to do\nsomething, even if he feels the officer is in the wrong, he will comply. (Tr. 96, 97)  In the future, if\ntold to turn off the music he will. Applicant was scheduled to leave the Air Force and the state,\nwhich influenced his decision to plead \u201cno contest\u201d to the charge. Additionally, he was told that after\nsix months \u201cit would no longer exist.\u201d (Tr. 36, Gov Ex 1) Applicant no longer lives in an apartment\ncomplex. \nIn October 2005, Applicant was working as a warehouse receiving coordinator on the 3:30\nto midnight shift Monday through Friday. Occasionally, he was required to work Saturdays as well.\nThe previous night he left work at midnight and was back at work at 5:00 a.m.  He was able to get\nthree hours of sleep. After work on Saturday, he went home and tried to nap, but could not. He took\nsome energy pills he used when he worked out and went to a roadhouse and drank beer. Even though\nhe had been drinking, the energy pills gave him the misconception he was all right to drive. (Tr. 41)\nWhen he left, he was rolling his motorcycle out of the parking lot when stopped by the police.  He\ncould not get the engine started. Applicant\u2019s Blood Alcohol Content (BAC) was .22%. He was\narrested for Actual Physical Control (ACP) of a motorized vehicle while under the influence, a\nmisdemeanor. Applicant was never arrested for Aggravated Driving Under the Influence (DUI). \nApplicant was fined $200, sentenced to 20 hours of community service, required to undergo\nalcohol assessment, and to attend a Victim Impact Panel (VIP).  His sentence was deferred for two\nyears. At the alcohol evaluation, the counselor said Applicant did not have an alcohol problem nor\nwas he an alcoholic. (Tr. 57) In March 2006, a Department of Public Safety hearing was conducted\nand found there was not sufficient evidence to revoke Applicant\u2019s driver\u2019s license. (Tr. 37, App Ex\nG)  In May 2006, Applicant completed VIP and in July 2006, he completed his required 20 hours\nof community service. (App Ex G)\nThe deferred sentence ends in February or March 2008. (Tr. 56-57) Applicant is not on\nprobation nor is he seeing a probation officer. (Tr. 80) A deferred sentence is made before a\njudgment or finding of guilt. The sentence is deferred for a period of time upon certain conditions\nthat must be satisfied.  If Applicant complies with all court orders, the court will dismiss the case\nand the charge will not appear on his record.  If successfully completed, the case will be dismissed,\nand the record of a plea expunged from the record. \n\n5\nApplicant acknowledged spending two days in jail was a \u201cbig wake-up call.\u201d (Tr. 43) He\nrecognizes his arrest was a good thing. It caused him to consider the path he was on.  He realizes the\ndanger to himself and others by his actions that evening. He re-evaluated his role as a father, did not\nwant to be in jail again, and decided he needed to spend his free time differently.  He has since\nbecome involved in a new relationship. He states he will not allow himself or others to be in such\na situation in the future. (Tr. 94) No recent alcohol related incidents appear in the record. \nIn March 2006, Applicant completed an Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations\nProcessing (e-QIP).  Applicant listed his 2004 noise violation arrest and his 2005 APC arrest on his\ne-QIP. However, he answered \u201cno\u201d to question 23 which asked if during the previous seven years\nhe had been subject to disciplinary proceedings under the UCMJ.  Applicant had received an Article\n15 in August 1999, which was six and a half years earlier. Applicant thought the event and Article\n15 had occurred more than seven years prior. He miscalculated in determining the seven-year period.\nThe event had occurred two months before the end of the seven-year period and the Article 15\noccurred five months before the period ended.\nIn May 1984, Applicant first consumed alcohol. He was drinking during the incident in May\n1999 resulting in the Article 15. He was drinking prior to his January 2004 and October 2005 arrests.\nApplicant continues to drink and imposes a three-beer limit on himself if he is going to drive his\nmotorcycle or vehicle. (Tr. 61) He drinks on most, but not every weekend. (Tr.82) In the past month\nhe has probably had ten drinks. (Tr. 82)\nPOLICIES\nThe Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified\nInformation, dated August 2006, sets forth Disqualifying Conditions (DC) and Mitigating\nConditions (MC) for each applicable guideline. Additionally, each decision must be a fair and\nimpartial commonsense decision based upon the relevant and material facts and circumstances, the\nwhole person concept, and the factors listed in Section 6.3 of the Directive. The adjudicative\nguidelines are to be applied by administrative judges on a case-by-case basis with an eye toward\nmaking determinations that are clearly consistent with the interests of national security. The\npresence or absence of a particular condition or factor for or against clearance is not determinative\nof a conclusion for or against an applicant.  However, the adjudicative guidelines should be followed\nwhenever a case can be measured against this policy guidance. Considering the evidence as a whole,\nI conclude the relevant guidelines to be applied here are Guideline G, alcohol consumption,\nGuideline E, personal conduct, and Guideline J, criminal conduct.\nBURDEN OF PROOF\nThe sole purpose of a security clearance decision is to decide if it is clearly consistent with\nthe national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for an applicant. Initially, the\nGovernment must establish, by substantial evidence, that conditions exist in the personal or\nprofessional history of the applicant which disqualify, or may disqualify, an applicant from being\neligible for access to classified information. The burden of proof in a security clearance case is\nsomething less than a preponderance of evidence, although the government is required to present\nsubstantial evidence to meet its burden of proof.  Substantial evidence is more than a scintilla, but\n\n ISCR Case No. 93-1390 (January 27, 1995) at pp. 7-8; Directive, Enclosure 3, Item E3.1.15\n2\n6\nless than a preponderance of the evidence. All that is required is proof of facts and circumstances\nwhich indicate an applicant is at risk for mishandling classified information, or that an applicant\ndoes not demonstrate the high degree of judgment, reliability, or trustworthiness required of persons\nhandling classified information.  Additionally, the government must prove controverted facts alleged\nin the SOR.  Once the government has met its burden, the burden shifts to an applicant to present\nevidence to refute, extenuate or mitigate the government's case.  Additionally, an applicant has the\nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.2\nAs noted by the United States Supreme Court in Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518,\n528 (1988), \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d A person who has access to classified\ninformation enters into a fiduciary relationship with the government based on trust and confidence.\nThe government, therefore, has a compelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the\nrequisite judgment, reliability and trustworthiness of one who will protect the national interests. The\n\u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any reasonable doubt\nabout an applicant\u2019s suitability for access to classified information in favor of protecting national\nsecurity.  Security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials. \nCONCLUSIONS\nThe Government satisfied its initial burden of proof under alcohol consumption. As stated\nin paragraph 21 of the Adjudicative Guidelines the concern is that excessive alcohol consumption\noften leads to the exercise of questionable judgment, unreliability, failure to control impulses, and\ncan raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness.  Disqualifying Condition\n(DC) 22(a) \u201calcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under the influence,\nfighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other criminal incidents of concern,\nregardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent\u201d applies.\nApplicant had been drinking prior to the event in May 1999 and prior to his arrest in 2004\nfor noise violation.  However, his drinking was not the cause of the problems.  His drinking prior\nto the 2005 APC was the cause of the problem. The APC was an alcohol-related incident.  Applicant\nhad little sleep the night before, went out drinking, drank too much, and took some energy pills gave\nhim the feeling he as okay to drive.  As he was leaving, he could not get his motorcycle started and\nwas arrested for actual physical control. Based on his BAC at the time, it was a good thing he could\nnot start his motorcycle.\nEven though Applicant was arrested, he believes this was for the best because it caused him\nto consider the path he was on.  He realizes the danger he could have put himself or others in that\nevening by his drinking and driving. He evaluated his life and decided he would never allow himself\nor others to be in such a position.  The conduct has not repeated itself. Applicant\u2019s alcohol use was\nevaluated and the counselor stated he did not believe Applicant had an alcohol problem or was an\nalcoholic. Mitigating Condition (MC) 23(a) \u201cso much time has passed, or the behavior was so\ninfrequent, or it happened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not\ncast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment\u201d applies.\n\n7\nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability and trustworthiness.\nBy its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules\nand regulations. In 1999, Applicant received an Article 15 for having sexual relations with an airman\nin his unit.  In 2004, he was arrested for noise violation, and in 2005 for APC.  DC 31(a) \u201ca single\nserious crime or multiple lesser offenses\u201d applies.  Applicant\u2019s APC sentence was deferred and does\nnot end for another six months.  DC 31(d) \u201cindividual is currently on parole or probation\u201d does not\napply because a deferred sentence is not parole or probation.  The deferred sentence is made before\na finding or judgment of guilty has been made.\nEight  years ago, Applicant and his wife were undergoing marital problems.  His wife wanted\na divorce and returned to England. A younger woman showed him attention and Applicant and the\nwoman had sexual relations. A man in the midst of marital problems can be affected by the attention\nof a younger woman.  But when the person is a married NCO and the woman an airman in his unit,\nit violates Air Force regulations and is prejudicial to good order and discipline in the armed forces.\nIt is their positions in the military that caused the problem.  Applicant acknowledges he should not\nhave had relations with this woman, even consensual relations. His conduct was a mistake, but was\nnot rape. A woman who is raped is unlikely to have breakfast with her rapist and then call him that\nafternoon, invites him to dinner, and then pay for dinner.  She was 22 years old, drank too much and\ndid something she later regretted, which was unfortunate. \nApplicant acted inappropriately, was punished, and went on to complete twenty years of\nhonorable service.  MC 32(a) \u201cso much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or\nit happened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not case doubt on\nthe individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment\u201d applies. The incident occurred eight\nyears ago and Applicant was sufficiently punished for his inappropriate conduct.  Enough time has\npassed that the conduct no longer cases doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\nIn 2004, an apartment security guard told him to turn off the music in his apartment.  Instead\nof complying, Applicant discussed the difference between turning down the music and tuning it off.\nA witness stated Applicant did everything to comply with the requests short of turning off the music\ncompletely.  Shortly thereafter, three on-duty officers arrive, tackle Applicant, handcuff him, and\narrest him for noise violation. This appears to be an over reaction by the city police for the office\nwas having loud music and he had turned it down. This was a learning experience for Applicant.\nIn the future, Applicant will comply with all police directions.  This reaction by the city police does\nnot raise a security concern. MC 32(a) applies because it does not cause doubt on Applicant\u2019s\nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. \nIn 2005, Applicant was arrested for APC and his sentence deferred until early 2008.\nApplicant completed his court directed alcohol evaluation, paid the fine, and completed his\ncommunity service.  He has complied with the court orders. There is no indication Applicant was\nadditionally ordered to obey the law. Even if he had been ordered to obey the law, this does not\nimpose an additional requirement for all citizens are required to obey the law and can be called to\naccount for their actions if they fail to do so.\nShould Applicant complete the deferment period, the case and all charges will be dismissed.\nApplicant\u2019s acknowledges his actions were wrong and the conduct has not been repeated. Spending\ntwo days in jail caused him to reevaluate his role as a father and consider the path he was on. He\ndoes not want to return to jail again and has changed the way he spends his free time.  He realizes\n\n8\nthe danger to himself and other that drinking and driving poses and will not allow himself or others\nto be in such a situation in the future. \nThe allegation of falsification under Guideline E, personal conduct is unfounded. The\nGovernment has shown Applicant\u2019s answer to questions 23 on his e-QIP was incorrect, but this does\nnot prove the Applicant deliberately failed to disclose information about his Article 15. Deliberate\nomission, concealment, or falsification of a material fact in any written document or oral statement\nto the Government when applying for a security clearance is a security concern. But every inaccurate\nstatement is not a falsification. A falsification must be deliberate and material. It is deliberate if it\nis done knowingly and willfully. \nThe question asks about disciplinary proceedings under the UCMJ during the previous seven\nyears.  Applicant completed his e-QIP in March 2006 and reported his 2004 noise violation arrest\nand his 2005 ACP arrest.  He did not report the Article 15.  The conduct resulting in the Article 15\noccurred in May 1999, two months inside the seven-year window contemplated by the question.\nHis Article 15 was received in August 1999, five months before the period being in question was\nto expire. The Applicant says he miscalculated the seven year period and denied intentional\nfalsification.  I found Applicant\u2019s explanation plausible. After hearing his testimony, observing his\ndemeanor, and evaluating all the evidence of record, I found his testimony credible on the\nfalsification issue.  I am satisfied he did not intentionally falsify his SF 86.  \nIn reaching my conclusions, the \u201cwhole person\u201d must be considered and the events cannot\nbe handled piecemeal.  Therefore, I have also considered: the nature, extent, and seriousness of the\nconduct; Applicant\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; the circumstances surrounding the\nconduct; Applicant\u2019s voluntary and knowledgeable participation; the motivation for the conduct; the\nfrequency and recency of the conduct; presence or absence of rehabilitation; potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and the probability that the circumstance or conduct will continue\nor recur in the future. \nApplicant made three serious mistakes during the last eight years, none of which are likely\nto repeat themselves. Since he is no longer in the service, having sexual relations with someone\njunior in grade in his unit cannot repeat itself.  He will never again be involved with a subordinate.\nWhen directed to take action by a police officer, even an off-duty police officer, Applicant will\ncomply. Applicant understands the danger he put himself and other in when he attempted to drive\nafter drinking and will not commit that misconduct again. I find for Applicant as to alcohol\nconsumption, personal conduct, and criminal conduct. \nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal Findings as required by Section 3, Paragraph 7, of Enclosure 1 of the Directive are\nhereby rendered as follows:\nParagraph 1 Alcohol Consumption: FOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\n\n9\nParagraph 2 Personal Conduct:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 3 Criminal Conduct: \nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 3.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 3.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 3.c:\nFor Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.

ABLARD\nAPPEARANCES\nFOR GOVERNMENT\nNichole Noel, Esq. , Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nSYNOPSIS\nApplicant, a 27-year-old employee of a defense contractor, accumulated delinquent debts as\na result of a severe injury in 2001 that precluded his work as an installer of office structures. He has\nsince taken action pay or settle all but two of the debts and has offered a substantial partial payment\nto one creditor and is in negotiation with the second one. He lives within his means and has\nmitigating security concerns by his actions to resolve the security concerns. Clearance is granted. \nSTATEMENT OF CASE\nOn or about February 28, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA),\n\n2\npursuant to Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry, as\namended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel\nSecurity Clearance Review Program (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended and modified,\nand subject to the revised Adjudicative Guidelines effective September 1, 2006, issued a Statement\nof Reasons (SOR) to Applicant which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary\naffirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant\nor continue a security clearance for Applicant. DOHA recommended the case be referred to an\nadministrative judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or\nrevoked.\nOn March 30, 2007, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations and requested a hearing.\nThe matter was assigned to me on June 20, 2007. A notice of hearing was issued on July 20, 2007,\nfor a hearing on August 6, 2007, and held that day. The government offered four exhibits. Applicant\noffered nine into evidence at the hearing and provided post hearing submissions on August 17, 2007,\n(Exh. J.), October 9, 2007, (Exh. K), and October 9, 2007,(Exh. L). All of the offered exhibits were\nadmitted in evidence without objection. The transcript was received on August 20, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant admitted with explanation seven of the nine SOR allegations relating to delinquent\ndebts. He and denied two which were duplicates of two of the seven he admitted. After a complete\nreview of the record, I make the following additional findings of fact:\nApplicant is a 27-year-old employee of a defense contractor working overseas as an installer\nof furnishings in U.S. embassies. He also does the same type of commercial installations in the U.S.\nfor the same company for whom he works overseas. He has had financial difficulties stemming from\nan accident in 2001 when he severely injured his right hand which made it impossible for him to\nwork. He also donated a kidney to his wife which caused him to miss work for two months and\naffected both of their health causing a decline in family income. \nAn analysis of the debts alleged in the SOR indicates as follows from testimony and\ndocumentary evidence submitted in the record:\n1. Par. 1.a.: Debt of $57 for carry-out. Settled on March 17, 2007 (Exh. A). \n2. Par. 1.b.:Credit card debt of $9,653 for purchases. Offer was made by Applicant for\npayment of $5,000 but creditor demanded payment in full. In negotiation which resulted in\ndetermination that debt was no longer on his credit report since determined to be\nuncollectible since over six years old (Exh. L). \n3. Par. 1.c.:Debt of $834 for cell phone settled for $420 (Exh. B).\n4. Par. 1.d.:Credit card debt for $1,048 settled on March 17, 2007, for $656. (Exh. C).\n5. Par. 1.e.:Duplicate of 1.d. \n\n3\n6. Par. 1.f.:Eviction charges of $3,457 during his unemployment as a result of his accident.\nHe is in negotiation with landlord as to amount assessed as he believes it to be very excessive\n(Tr. 25-26). \n7. Par. 1.g.:Credit card debt of $7,291 which is a duplicate of 1.b.(Exh. H). \n8. Par. 1.h.:Credit card debt of $1,587 which has grown with interest to $2,954 and has been\nsettled. One payment of $1,370 has been made and like amount was deducted on April 30,\n2007, to settle the debt in full (Exhs. E and I).  \n9. Par.1.i.: Medical bill of $75 paid December 13, 2006 (Exh. G). \nApplicant is well regarded by his ;employer for his work as a well-motivated, competent\nperformer who meets objectives (Exh. J). His domestic work pays approximately $1,000 bi-weekly.\nHis wife is employed and her pay is approximately $750 bi-weekly (Tr. 35). He has one step-child\nage eleven and he and his wife have a three year old. Both children have modest education savings\naccounts. \nApplicant\u2019s work overseas in embassies produces substantially more income than his U.S.\nwork so he needs a security clearance to perform that work which he has applied to settlement of his\ndelinquent debts. He does not now have a credit card and lives within his means. He and his wife\nhave reasonable rental payments with a housing facility that bases tenant payments on family\nincome. He has two automobiles that are six and twelve years old. He owes nothing on either of\nthem. He and his wife are exploring the possibility of buying a home once the delinquent debts are\nresolved.\nApplicant has made good faith efforts to resolve delinquent debts arising from causes beyond\nhis control and has fully paid the majority of them. He has received credit counseling (Tr. 25). He\nhas been in discussions with the creditor for two of the three remaining listed delinquent debts of\nwhich one is a duplicate (SOR \u00b6 1.b. and 1.g.). He offered to pay $5,000 on the  $9,000 debt but the\noffer was refused and it now has been dropped from his credit report. He is also in negotiation with\nthe third creditor the eviction charges (SOR \u00b6 1.f.).\nPOLICIES\n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S.\n518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has \u201cthe authority to control access to\ninformation bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently\ntrustworthy to occupy a position that will give that person access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527.\nAn evaluation of whether the applicant meets the security guidelines includes consideration of the\nfollowing factors: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances\nsurrounding the conduct; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and\nmaturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence\nof rehabilitation and other behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential\nfor pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nRevised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG \u00b6 2 a). Security clearances are granted only when \u201cit is clearly\n\n4\nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Executive Order No. 10865 \u00a7 2. See Executive Order\nNo. 12968 \u00a7 3.1(b).\nInitially, the Government must establish, by something less than a preponderance of the\nevidence, that conditions exist in the personal or professional history of the applicant which\ndisqualify, or may disqualify, the applicant from being eligible for access to classified information\nSee Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. The applicant then bears the burden of demonstrating it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance. \u201cAny doubt as to\nwhether access to classified information is clearly consistent with national security will be resolved\nin favor of the national security.\u201d (AG \u00b6 2 b) \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they\nmust, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. See Executive Order No. 12968 \u00a7 3.1(b).\nCONCLUSIONS\nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all appropriate\nadjudicative factors under the revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) and factors in the Directive, I\nconclude the following with respect to all allegations set forth in the SOR:\nApplicant\u2019s delinquent debts, prompted the allegation of security concern under Guideline\nF since an individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to\ngenerate funds (AG \u00b6 18). Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying\ninclude a history of not meeting financial obligations (AG \u00b6 19 c) and evidence of inability or\nunwillingness to satisfy debts. (AG \u00b6 19 a) Mitigating Conditions (MC) that might apply include the\nfact that the behavior happened so long ago or under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur\nand does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability , trustworthiness, or good judgment\n(AG \u00b6 20 a), or the conditions that resulted in the behavior were largely beyond the person\u2019s control\nas a result of medical issues and that the person acted responsibly (AG \u00b6 20 b), or the person has\nreceived counseling for financial problems and there are clear indications that the problem is being\nresolved or is under control (AG \u00b6 20 c), or the person has initiated a good-faith effort to repay\noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts (AG \u00b6 20 d). I find that the evidence in this matter\njustifies application of all the cited mitigating conditions to Applicant. \nIn all adjudications, the protection of our national security is of paramount concern. Persons\nwho have access to classified information have an overriding responsibility for the security concerns\nof the nation. The objective of the security clearance process is the fair-minded, commonsense\nassessment of a person\u2019s trustworthiness and fitness for access to classified information. \nThe \u201cwhole person\u201d concept recognizes we should view a person by the totality of his acts\nand omissions. Each case must be judged on its own merits taking into consideration all relevant\ncircumstances, and applying sound judgment, mature thinking, and careful analysis. Applicant\nimpressed me at the hearing as a credible, hard-working person whose debts compared to his assets\nhad accumulated as a result of his injuries to the point that they became delinquent. The conditions\nare unlikely to recur. He has taken significant corrective steps and established to my satisfaction that\nhe is financially responsible.\nAfter considering all the evidence in its totality, and as an integrated whole to focus on the\n\n5\nwhole person of Applicant, I conclude that a security clearance should be granted. \nFORMAL FINDINGS \nFormal findings as required by the Directive are as follows:\nParagraph 1. Guideline F:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a.:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b.:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c.:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d.:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e.:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f.:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g.:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h.:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.i.:\nFor Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or renew a security clearance for Applicant.

Howry, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\n\n2\nSYNOPSIS\nIn 1996, the Applicant was charged with two felonies, but found guilty of Second Degree\nBurglary, a misdemeanor.  In 1999, this conviction was cleared from the Applicant\u2019s record.  In\nanswer to Section 23 on his September 2005 Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing\n(e-QIP), the Applicant failed to disclose his felony charges.  His attorney had advised the Applicant\nthat he was not required to disclose the felony charges on any job applications.  Were it not for this\nadvice, he would have disclosed the felony charges.  There was no wilful falsification; and as such,\nno violation of 18 U.S.C. Section 1001.  The Applicant has the unqualified support of his superiors\nin the work place. Clearance is granted.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn January 4, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to\nExecutive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2,\n1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant, which detailed the reasons why DOHA\ncould not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant and\nrecommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether a clearance should be denied\nor revoked.\nApplicant filed an Answer to the SOR on January 25, 2007.\nThe case was received by the undersigned on March 19, 2007.  A notice of hearing was\nissued on March 27, 2007, and the case was heard on April 24, 2007.  The Government submitted\ndocumentary evidence.  Testimony was taken from the Applicant, who also submitted documentary\nevidence.  The transcript (TR) was received on May 3, 2007.  The issues raised here are whether the\nApplicant's past Criminal Conduct and alleged Personal Conduct militate against the granting of a\nsecurity clearance.  [The Applicant denies any wilful falsification, and any related violation of 18\nU.S.C. Section 1001.] \nFINDINGS OF FACT\nThe following Findings of Fact are based on Applicant's Answer to the SOR, the documents\nand the live testimony.  The Applicant is 37, and is employed by a defense contractor who seeks a\nsecurity clearance on behalf of the Applicant.  After a complete and thorough review of the evidence\nin the record, and upon due consideration of the same, I make the following additional Findings of\nFact.\nGuideline E - Personal Conduct & Guideline J - Criminal Conduct\n1.a. and 2.a.  In May of 1996, the Applicant was arrested, and charged with two felonies (TR\nat page 33 line 11 to page 35 line 24, at page 36 line 11 to page 39 line 12, and Government Exhibit\n(GX) 2).  He was found guilty of Second Degree Burglary, a misdemeanor (Id).  [The SOR does not\nallege the 1996 incident as part of the Applicant\u2019s Criminal Conduct, but only alleges a violation of\n18 U.S.C. 1001.]  In 1999, this conviction was cleared from the Applicant\u2019s record (Appellant\u2019s\n\n3\nExhibit (AppX) A).\nIn answer to Section 23 on his September 2005 e-QIP, the Applicant failed to disclose his\nfelony charges (GX 1 at page 20).  His attorney had advised the Applicant that he was not required\nto disclose the felony charges on any job applications (TR at page 26 line 20 to page 27 line 10, and\nat page 31 line 9 to page 32 line 14).  Were it not for this advice, he would have disclosed the felony\ncharges (Id).  There was no wilful falsification; and as such, no violation of 18 U.S.C. Section 1001.\n\n4\nPOLICIES\nEnclosure 2 and Section E.2.2. of the 1992 Directive set forth both policy factors, and\nconditions that could raise or mitigate a security concern.  Furthermore, as  set forth in the\nDirective,\"[each clearance decision must be a fair and impartial common sense determination based\nupon consideration of all the relevant and material information and the pertinent criteria and\nadjudication policy in enclosure 2, including as appropriate:\na. Nature, extent and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding\ncircumstances.\nb. Frequency and recency of the conduct.\n \nc. Age and maturity of the applicant.\nd. Motivation of the applicant, and the extent to which the conduct\nwas negligent, willful, voluntary, or undertaken with knowledge of\nthe consequence involved.\ne. Absence or presence of rehabilitation.\nf. Probability that circumstances or conduct will continue or recur in\nthe future.\u201d\nThe Administrative Judge, however, can only draw those inferences or conclusions that have\na reasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record.  The Judge cannot draw inferences or\nconclusions based on evidence which is speculative or conjectural in nature.\nThe Government must make out its case under Guidelines E (Personal Conduct) and J\n(Criminal Conduct); which establishes doubt about a person's judgment, reliability and\ntrustworthiness.  While a rational connection, or nexus, must be shown between an applicant's\nadverse conduct and his ability to effectively safeguard classified information, with respect to\nsufficiency of proof of a rational connection, objective or direct evidence is not required.\nThen, the Applicant must remove that doubt with substantial evidence in refutation,\nexplanation, mitigation or extenuation, which demonstrates that the past adverse conduct is unlikely\nto be repeated, and that the Applicant presently qualifies for a security clearance.\nPersonal conduct is conduct involving questionable judgement, untrustworthiness,\nunreliability, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations.  The Government must be able\nto place a high degree of confidence in a security clearance holder to abide by all security rules and\nregulations at all times and in all places.  If an applicant has demonstrated a lack of respect for the\nlaw, then there exists the possibility that an applicant may demonstrate the same attitude towards\nsecurity rules and regulations.\nCONCLUSIONS\n\n5\nWhen the Applicant answered his September 2005 e-QIP, he answered Section 23 to the best\nof his ability, based on the advice of counsel.  The 1996 conviction had been cleared from his record;\nand as such, he mistakenly thought he was not required to disclose that he was charged with a felony.\nThis being the case, I find no \u201cdeliberate omission, concealment, or falsification\u201d here, as is\nrequired by the first disqualifying condition under Personal Conduct (emphasis supplied).  The\nApplicant testified credibly, as attested to by those who know him; and as such, I find there was no\nwilful falsification and no related Criminal Conduct (AppX B).\nFurthermore, I am not limited to the mitigating conditions, delineated in the Directive, in\ndeciding if an Applicant has demonstrated extenuation or mitigation.  Here, those who know the\nApplicant at the workplace speak most highly of his character, credibility and trustworthiness (AppX\nB).  The totality of the Appellant\u2019s conduct and circumstances, as set forth at length above, clearly\nwarrants a favorable Decision under the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d  Mitigation is shown; and as such,\nGuidelines E and J are found for the Applicant.\nConsidering all the evidence, the Applicant has rebutted the Government's case regarding his\nalleged Criminal Conduct and Personal Conduct.  The Applicant has thus met the mitigating\nconditions of Guidelines E and J, and of Section E.2.2. of the Directive.  Accordingly, he has met\nhis ultimate burden of persuasion under Guidelines E and J.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal Findings required by paragraph 25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive are:\nParagraph 1:\nFOR THE APPLICANT\na. For the Applicant.\nParagraph 2:\nFOR THE APPLICANT\na. For the Applicant.\nFactual support and reasons for the foregoing are set forth in FINDINGS OF FACT and\nCONCLUSIONS, supra.\n\n6\nDECISION\nIn light of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly consistent with\nthe national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant.\nRichard A.

LEONARD\nAPPEARANCES\nFOR GOVERNMENT\nJulie R. Edmunds, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nSYNOPSIS\nApplicant has a history of unresolved financial problems. He did not present sufficient\nevidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the financial considerations security concern.\nEligibility for a security clearance is denied.\n\n Executive Order 10865, dated February 20, 1960, as amended, and DoD Directive 5220.6, dated January 2,\n1\n1992, as amended (Directive).\n See Memorandum from the Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence, dated August 30, 2006, Subject:\n2\nImplementation of Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information (December\n29, 2005). \n2\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nApplicant contests the Defense Department\u2019s intent to deny or revoke his eligibility for a\nsecurity clearance. Acting under the relevant authority,  the agency issued a statement of reasons\n1\n(SOR) to Applicant on March 20, 2007. The SOR\u2014which is equivalent to an administrative\ncomplaint\u2014details the factual basis for the action and alleges a security concern under Guideline F\nfor financial considerations based on multiple delinquent debts, to include civil judgment.\nIn addition to the Directive, this case is brought under the revised Adjudicative Guidelines\nfor Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information (Revised Guidelines) approved by\nthe President on December 29, 2005. The Revised Guidelines were then modified by the Defense\nDepartment, effective September 1, 2006. They supersede or replace the guidelines published in\nEnclosure 2 to the Directive. They apply to all adjudications and other determinations where an SOR\nhas been issued on September 1, 2006, or thereafter.  The Directive is pending formal amendment.\n2\nThe Revised Guidelines apply to this case because the SOR is dated March 20, 2007, which is after\nthe effective date.  \nApplicant timely replied to the SOR in writing on April 11, 2007. He elected to have his case\ndecided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. He denied all indebtedness alleged under\nGuideline F in his written reply to the SOR. Also, he provided a one-page explanation of his\nfinancial situation.   \nOn May 1, 2007, the government submitted its written case consisting of all relevant and\nmaterial information that could be adduced at a hearing. This so-called file of relevant material\n(FORM) was mailed to Applicant and it was received by him on May 7, 2007. Applicant did not\nreply to the FORM within the 30-day period. The case was assigned for decision on July 19, 2007.\n \nIn general terms, the major issue is as follows: Is it clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant or continue eligibility for a security clearance for Applicant in light of his alleged\nhistory of unresolved financial problems? \nFINDINGS OF FACT\n\n Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988) (\u201cit should be obvious that no one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a\n3\nsecurity clearance\u201d); Duane v. Department of Defense, 275 F.3d 988, 994 (10  Cir. 2002) (\u201cIt is likewise plain that there\nth\nis no \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance, so that full-scale due process standards do not apply to cases such as Duane\u2019s.\u201d).\n Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.\n4\n ISCR Case No. 96-0277 (App. Bd. Jul. 11, 1997).\n5\n3\nBased on the record evidence as a whole, the following facts are established. \n1.\nApplicant is a 48-year-old employee of a company engaged in federal contracting. He earned\na B.S. in 1990. Applicant has worked in the field of finance since at least 1993. During  1993\u20131999,\nhe worked as a program financial analyst. During 1999\u20132002, he worked as a financial analyst.\nDuring 2003\u20132005, he worked as a cost scheduling and control analyst II. And from 2005 to present,\nhe has worked as a senior cost scheduling and control analyst.\n2.\nApplicant married in 1991. He and his wife had two children, born in 1991 and 1992.\nApplicant divorced in 2002. Applicant is required to pay $480 per month in child support, and he\nis current with his child-support obligation (Exhibit 6 at 2). \n3.\nApplicant has a history of unresolved financial problems, as established by derogatory\ninformation in a March 2007 credit report (Exhibit 6). The report reveals a $963 civil judgment filed\nin February 2005. The report also reveals nine collection accounts for $972 in total, and two charged-\noff credit card accounts for $9,494 in total. Altogether, the credit report reveals $11,429 in\ndelinquent debt. \n4.\nThe SOR alleges that Applicant has 12 delinquent debts for about $11,713 in total. The credit\nreport establishes 12 delinquent debts for $11,429 in total with Applicant as the debtor. None of the\ndebts are paid or otherwise resolved. \n5.\nIn his written responses to interrogatories (Exhibit 5) and to the SOR, Applicant denies the\ndebts for various reasons. Applicant did not present any documentary evidence verifying his\nstatements. Other than his written responses to the interrogatories and the SOR, Applicant did not\npresent proof of payment or other documentary evidence about the debts in question. Nor did he\npresent documentary evidence about his overall financial situation.\nGENERAL PRINCIPLES OF LAW AND POLICIES\nNo one has a right to a security clearance.  As noted by the Supreme Court in Department\n3\nof Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe clearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations\nshould err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d  Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the\n4\nDirective, any doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified information\nwill be resolved in favor of protecting national security.\nThe agency appellate authority has made it clear that the only purpose of a security clearance\ndecision is to decide if it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security\nclearance for an applicant.  There is no presumption in favor of granting or continuing access to\n5\n\n ISCR Case No. 02-18663 (App. Bd. Mar. 23, 2004).\n6\n Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.14.\n7\n Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n8\n Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n9\n Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n10\n ISCR Case No. 01-20700 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002) at 3 (citations omitted).\n11\n Executive Order 10865, \u00a7 7.\n12\n Revised Guidelines at 13\u201314 (setting forth the disqualifying and mitigating conditions). \n13\n4\nclassified information.  The government has the burden of presenting evidence to establish facts\n6\nalleged in the SOR that have been controverted.  An applicant is responsible for presenting evidence\n7\nto refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts that have been admitted or proven.  In addition, an\n8\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.  In Egan,\n9\nthe Supreme Court said that the burden of proof in a security clearance case is less than the\npreponderance of the evidence.  The agency appellate authority has followed the Court\u2019s reasoning,\n10\nand a judge\u2019s findings of fact are reviewed under the substantial-evidence standard.11\nThe Revised Guidelines sets forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when evaluating a\nperson\u2019s security clearance eligibility, including disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating\nconditions (MC) for each guideline. In addition, each clearance decision must be a fair and impartial\ncommonsense decision based upon consideration of all the relevant and material information, the\npertinent criteria and adjudication factors, and the whole-person concept. A person granted access\nto classified information enters into a special relationship with the government. The government\nmust be able to have a high degree of trust and confidence in those persons to whom it grants access\nto classified information. The decision to deny a person a security clearance is not a determination\nof an applicant\u2019s loyalty.  Instead, it is a determination that the applicant has not met the strict\n12\nguidelines the President has established for granting eligibility for a security clearance.\nCONCLUSIONS\nUnder Guideline F for financial considerations,  a security concern typically exists due to\n13\nsignificant unpaid debts. Failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by\nrules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability,\ntrustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information. An individual who is financially\noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal or unethical acts to generate funds to meet\nfinancial obligations. Similarly, an individual who is financially irresponsible may also be\nirresponsible, unconcerned, negligent, or careless in properly handling and safeguarding classified\ninformation.   \n\n DC 1 is \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts.\u201d \n14\n DC 3 is \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d \n15\n Examples of other large bureaucratic institutions that rely heavily on documentation include banks, insurance\n16\ncompanies, hospitals, universities, and the Armed Forces. \n Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.15. \n17\n5\nCiting the March 2007 credit report, the government contends Applicant has a history of\nunresolved financial problems. Applicant\u2019s contentions are:\n\u2022\nFor the $963 judgment, he contends he paid this debt before the judgment was obtained.\n\u2022\nFor the $256 collection account, he contends he paid this debt.\n\u2022\nFor the $51 collection account, he denies owing any money and claims he is a current\ncustomer in good standing with the creditor.\n\u2022\nFor the seven medical collection accounts, he denies responsibility and claims his ex-wife\nforged his signature for the medical bills.\n\u2022\nFor the two charged-off credit card accounts owed to the same creditor, he denies\nresponsibility. He claims his ex-wife had access to the credit cards and made charges without\nan intent to pay. \n\u2022\nHe contends there are errors with his credit history, which he has tried to correct. \nThe question is whether the record evidence is sufficient to show Applicant owes for the delinquent\ndebts alleged in the SOR. \nThe record evidence supports a conclusion that Applicant owes the delinquent debts alleged\nin the SOR. The March 2007 credit report (Exhibit 6) establishes 12 delinquent debts for $11,429\nin total. The credit report bears Applicant\u2019s name and social security number. He did not present any\nreliable information to rebut the authenticity and accuracy of the credit report. Accordingly, the\ncredit report is accepted as a genuine reflection of Applicant\u2019s financial condition as of March 2007.\nHis derogatory financial history, as shown in the credit report, is a security concern because it\nindicates inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts  and a history of not meeting financial\n14\nobligations  within the meaning of Guideline F. In addition, his history of unresolved financial\n15\nproblems indicates irresponsibility, neglect, or lack of concern, or all three.  \nNone of the mitigating conditions under Guideline F apply in Applicant\u2019s favor. He did not\npresent sufficient evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the security concern. In\nparticular, the record evidence is insufficient to establish that he has made a good-faith effort to pay\nor otherwise resolve his indebtedness. Given the lack of documentation, his contentions\u2014claims of\npayment, denials of responsibility, and an erroneous credit history\u2014are not accepted. Large\nbureaucratic institutions, like the Defense Department and the security-clearance programs it\nadministers, do not run on word-of-mouth.  They run on documentation. The documentation can\n16\nbe stored electronically or on paper, but it is up to Applicant to produce reliable evidence, to include\ndocumentary evidence, to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts proven by the credit report.17\nExamples of relevant documentation might include payment receipts, account statements, bank\nstatements, credit card statements, a release of a lien, a satisfaction of judgment, or a current credit\nreport. Applicant is not legally required to produce documentary evidence to prevail. But the lack\n\n6\nof documentation in a financial case makes it difficult to reach a favorable decision under the clearly-\nconsistent standard. Applicant has a background in finance, and he knew or should have known that\nsome sort of documentary evidence would make his case more persuasive. \nApplicant\u2019s history of unresolved financial problems outweighs the favorable evidence.\nApplicant did not meet his ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.\nIn reaching this conclusion, the whole-person concept was given due consideration and that analysis\ndoes not support a favorable outcome for Applicant.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nSOR \u00b6 1\u2013Guideline F:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraphs a\u2013l:\nAgainst Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all the facts and circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the national interest\nto grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.

The Applicant can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest\nin favor of the U.S. interest.  He is knowledgeable about his security responsibilities, and shows that\nhe can fulfill them.  Sufficient mitigation is shown.  Clearance is granted.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn December 29, 2006, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to\nExecutive Order 10865 (as amended) and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated\nJanuary 2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant, which detailed reasons why\nDOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant and\nrecommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether a clearance should be denied\nor revoked.\nThe Applicant responded to the SOR in writing on January 9, 2007, and requested a hearing.\nThe case was received by the undersigned on February 13, 2007, and a Notice of Hearing was issued\non February 27, 2007.\nA hearing was held on March 21, 2007, at which the Government presented four\ndocumentary exhibits.  Testimony was taken from the Applicant, who also submitted eleven exhibits.\nThe Government also requested that Administrative Notice be taken of certain adjudicative facts\nabout the State of Israel.  The request for Administrative Notice is marked Administrative Judge\nExhibit I, and the documents attached to the request are marked as Administrative Judge Exhibits\nI(A) through I(H).   The transcript was received on March 30, 2007. \nFINDINGS OF FACT\nThe Applicant is 43, married and has a Master of Science degree.  He is employed by a\ndefense contractor as an engineer, and he seeks to obtain a Secret-level DoD security clearance in\nconnection with his employment in the defense sector.\nThe Government opposes the Applicant's request for a security clearance, based upon the\nallegations set forth in the Statement of Reasons (SOR).  The following findings of fact are entered\nas to each paragraph and guideline in the SOR.  They are based on the Applicant's Answer to the\nSOR, the exhibits and the live testimony.\nParagraph 1 (Guideline B - Foreign Influence).  The Government alleges in this paragraph that the\nApplicant may have foreign connections which potentially make him vulnerable to coercion,\nexploitation or pressure.\n\n3\nThe Applicant was born in Belarus (then part of the Soviet Union) in 1964.  He emigrated\nfrom Belarus to Israel in October 1990 because of the anti-Semitic atmosphere in the Soviet Union\nat that time.  He went to Israel because he was allowed to travel there.(Transcript at 36, 43-44, 63-\n64.)  The Applicant traveled to Belarus twice since he left, the last time being in 1995.  His parents\nnow live in the United States, so he has no plans to return there.  (Transcript at 40.)\nThe Applicant stayed in Israel about one year before emigrating to the United States.  In\nIsrael, the Applicant found that he was discriminated against because he was from Belarus.\n(Transcript at 47-48, 62-63.)  In addition, his then fianc\u00e9 (now wife) is not Jewish and would also\nhave been discriminated against in Israel.  The Applicant developed no close ties to anyone in Israel\nduring his year there.  (Transcript at 36, 45-48.)  The Applicant has never returned to Israel for any\nreason since leaving in 1992.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit B.)\nThe Applicant became a naturalized American citizen in April 2002.    (Government Exhibit\n2.)  His wife was also born in Belarus, and she also became a naturalized American citizen in April\n2002.  (Government Exhibit 1, Applicant\u2019s Exhibit K.)  They were married in 1992, and have two\nAmerican born sons.  (Government Exhibit 1, Applicant\u2019s Exhibit D.)  They have about $1,200,000\nin assets in the United States.  (Transcript at 37, Applicant\u2019s Exhibit E.) \nThe Applicant\u2019s parents emigrated to the United States in1997.  (Transcript at 51-52.)  His\nmother became an American citizen in March 2003.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit C at 1.)  His father became\nan American citizen in April 2003.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit C at 2.) \nThe Applicant\u2019s mother-in-law and father-in-law are citizens of Belarus and reside there.\nThey are completing the process to allow them to emigrate to Canada, where they have another\ndaughter who is a Canadian citizen.  (Transcript at 53-54, Applicant\u2019s Exhibit J.)  They are both\nretired and have a pension income from non-governmental entities in Belarus.  (Transcript at 38-39.)\nThe Applicant does not talk to them.  (Transcript at 51-52.)  Concerning his relationship with his in-\nlaws the Applicant states, \u201c[We] don\u2019t have too close relationship with my in-laws because they were\nnot too happy about our marriage - - interracial marriage.\u201d  The Applicant has little knowledge of\ncurrent events in Belarus, and he has no strong emotional ties to that country.  (Transcript at 51-52.)\nThe Applicant has one sibling, a sister.  She is 11 years younger than the Applicant and they\nare not close.  The sister emigrated to Israel in about 1996 and continues to live there.  Both the sister\nand her husband work for the Israeli subsidiaries of American companies.  (Transcript at 38,\nApplicant\u2019s Exhibits H and I.)  The Applicant\u2019s relationship with his sister is not close, consisting\nof two or three phone calls a year.  (Transcript at 55-58.)  The Applicant was asked by Department\nCounsel, \u201cNow, as a brother and as blood, do you care about your sister\u2019s security and safety?\u201d  He\nreplied, \u201cI care about my children\u2019s security and safety more than my sister\u2019s.\u201d  (Transcript at 58.)\nThe Applicant was specifically asked about his feelings towards the State of Israel.  He\nstated, \u201cI didn\u2019t feel too comfortable when I came to Israel because I suddenly became Russian.\nAnd, so, it was for me it was a tough time.  So, I had much more easier time to live here than in\nIsrael.  And, so, I don\u2019t have any warm feelings for Israel.  I respect Israel as a democratic country;\nbut not more than U.S.\u201d  (Transcript at 62.)\n\n4\nThe Applicant testified about what he would do if he was approached by a foreign\nintelligence service.  He stated, \u201cFirst of all, I don\u2019t believe it will happen; but if, hypothetically, it\nwill happen, I will notify my Security Department at my work and I will follow their directions, and\nI will notify the FBI.\u201d  (Transcript at 61.)\nMitigation.\nThe Applicant submitted documentary evidence showing that he is well respected at his place\nof employment.  His most current performance appraisal states that, on the whole, he \u201cExceeded\nExpectations.\u201d  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit F.)  Statements from work associates and supervisors state that\nthe Applicant \u201cpossesses a high level of integrity,\u201d and that he is \u201chonest and hard-working.\u201d  A\nLead Software Engineer states, \u201cI, personally, would trust [the Applicant] with my life.\u201d\n(Applicant\u2019s Exhibit G.)  Finally, the Applicant testified that his friends are primarily work\nassociates, most of them native born Americans.  (Transcript at 64.)\nPOLICIES\nSecurity clearance decisions are not made in a vacuum.  Accordingly, the Department of\nDefense, in Enclosure 2 of the 1992 Directive, has set forth policy factors which must be given\n\"binding\" consideration in making security clearance determinations.  These factors should be\nfollowed in every case according to the pertinent guideline.  However, the factors are neither\nautomatically determinative of the decision in any case, nor can they supersede the Administrative\nJudge's reliance on his own common sense, as well as his knowledge of the law, human nature and\nthe ways of the world, in making a reasoned decision.  Because each security clearance case presents\nits own unique facts and circumstances, it cannot be assumed that these factors exhaust the realm\nof human experience, or apply equally in every case.  Based on the Findings of Fact set forth above,\nthe factors most applicable to the evaluation of this case will be set forth under CONCLUSIONS,\nbelow.\nIn addition, as set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive at pages 18-19, \u201cIn evaluating the\nrelevance of an individual\u2019s conduct, the [Administrative Judge] should consider the following\nfactors [General Factors]:\n(1)\nThe nature, extent and seriousness of the conduct\n(2)\nThe circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation\n(3)\nThe frequency and recency of the conduct\n(4)\nThe individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct\n(5)\nThe voluntariness of participation\n(6)\nThe presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent\nbehavior changes\n\n5\n(7)\nThe motivation for the conduct\n(8)\nThe potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress\n(9)\nThe likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d\nThe eligibility guidelines established in the DoD Directive identify personal characteristics\nand conduct which are reasonably related to the ultimate question of whether it is \"clearly consistent\nwith the national interest\" to grant an Applicant's request for access to classified information.\nIn the defense industry, the security of classified industrial secrets is entrusted to civilian\nworkers who must be counted upon to safeguard such sensitive information twenty-four hours a day.\nThe Government is therefore appropriately concerned where available information indicates that an\nApplicant for clearance may have foreign contacts or interests that could lead to acts of\nuntrustworthiness or unreliability on the Applicant's part.\nThe DoD Directive states, \"Each adjudication is to be an overall common sense\ndetermination based upon consideration and assessment of all available information, both favorable\nand unfavorable, with particular emphasis placed on the seriousness, recency, frequency, and\nmotivation for the individual's conduct; the extent to which conduct was negligent, willful,\nvoluntary, or undertaken with the knowledge of the circumstances or consequences involved; and,\nto the extent that it can be estimated, the probability that conduct will or will not continue in the\nfuture.\"  The Administrative Judge can only draw those inferences or conclusions that have a\nreasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record.  The Judge cannot draw inferences or\nconclusions based on evidence which is speculative or conjectural in nature.  Finally, as emphasized\nby President Eisenhower in Executive Order 10865, \"Any determination under this order...shall be\na determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the\nloyalty of the applicant concerned.\"\nCONCLUSIONS\nIt is the Government's responsibility to present substantial evidence to support the finding\nof a nexus, or rational connection, between the Applicant's conduct or circumstances and the granting\nof a security clearance.  If such a case has been established, the burden then shifts to the Applicant\nto go forward with evidence in rebuttal, explanation or mitigation which is sufficient to overcome\nor outweigh the Government's case.  The Applicant bears the ultimate burden of persuasion in\nproving that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him or her a security clearance.\nIn this case the Government has met its initial burden of proving by substantial evidence that\nthe Applicant has foreign connections which could cause a security concern (Guideline B).\nThe Applicant, on the other hand, has successfully mitigated the Government's case.  The\nApplicant\u2019s parents both live in the United States and are American citizens.  His sister lives in\nIsrael, but he has very limited contact with her, and little familial feeling.  It is difficult to call any\nfamily relationship \u201ccasual and infrequent,\u201d but this one comes close.  \n\nISCR Case No. 03-17620 at 4 (App. Bd. Apr. 17, 2006).\n1\n6\nThe evidence shows that the Applicant\u2019s relationship with his in-laws in Belarus is not close,\nprimarily because of the mixed nature of his marriage.  His in-laws are in the final stages of\nemigrating to Canada, a close ally of the United States.  Finally, neither of his wife\u2019s parents in\nBelarus is an agent of that government or, in my opinion, in a position to be exploited by that\ngovernment.  The possibility that the Applicant can be coerced by his in-laws is virtually nil.\nBased on the evidence the Government has presented, the following Disqualifying Conditions\narguably apply to this case: 7.(a) Contact with a foreign family member . . . who is a citizen of or\nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation,\ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; (b) connections to a foreign person . . . that create\na potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to protect sensitive information\nor technology and the individual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person . . . by providing that information;\nand (d) sharing living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of citizenship status, if that\nrelationship creates a heightened risk of foreign inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion.\nThe Applicant has provided compelling evidence to show that the following Mitigating\nConditions also apply to this particular case, given his particular background: 8(a) the nature of the\nrelationships with foreign persons, the country in which these persons are located, or the positions\nor activities of those persons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed\nin a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, group, organization,\nor government and the interests of the U.S.; (b) There is no conflict of interest, either because the\nindividual\u2019s sense of loyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country is\nso minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in the U.S.,\nthat the individual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest; and\n(c) Contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and infrequent that there is little\nlikelihood that it could create a risk of foreign influence or exploitation.\nI have also considered the information concerning the intelligence activities of the Israeli\ngovernment provided by Department Counsel in Administrative Judge\u2019s Exhibit I and its\nattachments I(A) through I(H).  In addition, I have also considered the repressive nature of the\nBelarusian government, as set forth in Government Exhibits 3 and 4.  The Applicant\u2019s connections\nto Belarus and Israel are tenuous at best.  He has presented compelling evidence concerning the\ndiscrimination he and his wife endured in both countries.  The Applicant has a real life appreciation\nfor the equal rights accorded to all citizens of the United States regardless of creed or national origin.\nIn addition, \u201c[A] Judge is not limited to Adjudicative Guidelines mitigating conditions when\ndeciding whether an applicant has demonstrated extenuation or mitigation.\u201d   The application of the\n1\nDirective\u2019s General Factors to the Applicant\u2019s foreign connections, specifically relevant General\nFactor (8), also justifies granting the Applicant a security clearance.  The totality of this Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and circumstances, as set forth at length above, including the virtually non-existent potential\nfor exploitation, shows that he warrants a favorable finding under the whole person standard.\n  \nThe record shows that the Applicant has been a patriotic American citizen for several years,\nand has substantial financial assets in the United States.  All of his immediate family are citizens of\nthe United States (especially his wife and children).  The Applicant is alert to the security concerns\n\n\u201c[Matters], such as evidence of an applicant\u2019s personal loyalties, the nature and extent of an\n2\napplicant\u2019s family ties to the U.S. relative to his ties to a foreign country, his or her social ties within the\nU.S., and many others raised by the facts of a given case can properly be factored in to a judge\u2019s evaluation\nof an applicant\u2019s worthiness for a security clearance.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 04-11414 at 4 (App. Bd. Mar. 5,\n2007).  (Citations omitted.)\n7\npresented by his particular circumstances and the responsibilities incumbent upon him.  The\nApplicant testified about the importance of his family in the United States, and his pride in being an\nAmerican citizen and a member of the defense industry.  Using the whole person standard, the\nApplicant has mitigated the security significance of his foreign connections and is eligible for a\nsecurity clearance.2\nOn balance, it is concluded that the Applicant has successfully overcome the Government's\ncase opposing his request for a DoD security clearance.  Accordingly, the evidence supports a finding\nfor the Applicant as to the factual and conclusionary allegations expressed in Paragraph 1 of the\nGovernment's Statement of Reasons.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal findings For or Against the Applicant on the allegations in the SOR, as required by\nParagraph 25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1:\nFor the Applicant.\nSubparagraph 1.a.:\nFor the Applicant.\nSubparagraph 1.b.:\nFor the Applicant.\nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant.\nWilford H.

Duffy, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nSYNOPSIS\nBased on an assessment of her as a whole person, Applicant mitigated security concerns over\nforeign influence as no \u201cheightened risk\u201d was established because of her ties to her parents who\nreside in Estonia, an ally of the U.S. While her mother was born in Russia, she left as a child; her\nfather was granted citizenship in Estonia.  Applicant is fully integrated into U.S. society with a\nhusband she married in 2001 and their child who are both U.S. citizens.  She became a naturalized\nU.S. citizen in November 2005; her travels to Estonia are to visit her parents.   It is improbable that\nforeign pressure on her relatives could create a situation that could result in the compromise of\nclassified information. Also, Applicant\u2019s property in Estonia is unlikely to result in conflict as her\nfinancial interests in the U.S. are substantially higher.   Clearance is granted.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR)\n\n       This procedure is required by Executive Order 10865, as amended, and Department of Defense Directive\n1\n5220.6, dated January 2, 1992 (Directive), as amended by Change 4, April 20, 1999.   \n       Applicant did receive a copy of the DoD Directive 5220.6 which was sent with her Statement of Reasons\n2\n(SOR).\n2\nto the Applicant on January 30, 2007.  The SOR detailed reasons why the Government could not\nmake the preliminary positive finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant\neligibility to Applicant that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a\nsecurity clearance for the Applicant.   The SOR alleged specific concerns over Foreign Influence\n1\n(Guideline B) in paragraph 1 and over Outside Activities (Guideline L) in paragraph 2. The SOR was\nbased on the revised (\u201cnew\u201d) Adjudicative Guidelines (AG)  issued on December 29, 2005, and\n2\nimplemented by the Department of Defense, effective September 1, 2006.   Applicant replied to the\nSOR allegations in an Answer notarized on February 21, 2007, and requested a hearing.  She\nadmitted the allegations in paragraph 1 and denied the allegation in paragraph 2.\nOn June 12, 2007, Department Counsel noted the case was ready to proceed; however, he\nalso filed a memo on June 18, 2007, that he had attempted to coordinate the hearing date with\nApplicant without success; so he asked the judge to set the hearing date without her concurrence.\nThe matter was assigned to another judge on June 14, 2007. Subsequently, a Notice of Hearing,\nissued on June 28, 2007, set the matter for July 16, 2007, at a location near where Applicant works\nand lives.  On July 13, 2007, Applicant stated she could not appear on July 17, 2007, and\nconsequently could not pursue her case.  On July 17, 2007, another judge handled the procedural\nissues at the scheduled hearing. (TR I)  Later, he documented that he questioned Applicant by\ntelephone as to why she had not appeared for the hearing.  She explained she was leaving the country\nwith her husband and child and had previously advised the assigned Department Counsel she could\nnot appear that date.  She requested the case be handled as a File of Relevant Material (FORM).\nDepartment Counsel objected to a FORM; instead he requested a default or that the hearing be re-\nscheduled.\nSubsequently, a DOHA management decision was made to re-schedule her hearing and\nassign a new judge and new counsel.  The case was re-assigned to me on July 20, 2007, for hearing.\nBecause Applicant was out of the country, the case could not be scheduled until August 28, 2007\nwhen a notice was issued setting the case for October 2, 2007.\nAt the October hearing (TR II) the Government offered one exhibit (Exhibits 1) which was\nadmitted into evidence without objection. Also, based on a memorandum requesting Administrative\nNotice of documents raising security concerns over both Russia and Estonia, I also admitted fourteen\ndocuments for Administration Notice (AN)  (Exhibits I-XIV).  Applicant testified, but submitted no\nexhibits  The transcript (TR II) was received on October 11, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nAfter a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due\n\n       The Estonian language is one of the world\u2019s most difficult languages to learn as it has fourteen cases.\n3\nDuring the Soviet era, the Russian language was imposed for official use.  (AN X, page 3)  \n3\nconsideration of that evidence, I make the following additional Findings of Fact:\nA professional linguist, Applicant is a 31-year-old employee of a defense contractor\n(Employer #1) in State #1 where she has worked as a freelance translator since January 2003.  She\nalso worked for Employer #1 from December 2001 to January 2002 as a project manager. In order\nto do classified work, she needs a security clearance.  In January 2006 she completed a Security\nClearance Application (Standard Form 86).  Applicant also works full time as an executive assistant\nfor an association that works with the U.S. Department of State to administer programs for overseas\nstudents. (Employer #2).  (Exhibit 1; TR II 15, 19-21, 29-34)\nApplicant has a certificate in Teaching English as a Second Language (TESL) and a Master\nof Arts degree from a U.S. university awarded in May 2005.  She is also certified as an \u201cOral\nProficiency Tester\u201d by the American Council on the Teaching of Foreign Languages.  (Answer) She\nspeaks four languages:  English, Estonian, Russian, and German.  She develops tests utilizing her\nknowledge of these four languages.  (TR II 16, 19, 29)\nBorn in Estonia, she received a degree from a university in Estonia and worked at a university\nin Estonia as a teacher of English from June 1999 to January 2001. Applicant entered the U.S. in\nFebruary 2001 to marry a U.S. citizen in March 2001. Applicant has a child who was born in 2007\nin the U.S.; she is currently on maternity leave from Employer #2. (TR II 35, 64)\nApplicant became a naturalized U.S. citizen in November 2005.  At that point she was no\nlonger a citizen of Estonia as that country does not recognize dual citizenship.  She gave up her\nEstonian passport and now uses a U.S. passport issued in January 2006.  She has no affiliation with\nany political or governmental organizations in Estonia or Russia.   (Exhibit 1; TR II 16, 19-20, 24-\n28) She has never lived in nor visited Russia though her parents were born there.  (Exhibit 1; TR II\n23)\nForeign Influence and Outside Activities \nHer mother and father live in Estonia, and Applicant talks to them weekly on the telephone.\nShe is an only child.  (TR II 39, 44-45)  Her mother who is 62 was born in Russia and is a citizen\nof Russia; however, she moved to Estonia when she was a child. Now retired, the mother was an\neconomist who worked as an accountant for a government-owned factory producing radio\nequipment, LP players, and records.  She has a pension from the Government of Estonia.  However,\nshe remains a citizen of Russia: when Estonia separated from Russian, residents had to pass an\nEstonian language  examination to become a citizen, and she failed it.  (Exhibit 1; Answer; TR II\n3\n16, 35-39) \nHer father who is 72 was born in Russia and now is a citizen of Estonia. When he was 22,\nhe moved to Estonia after he attended university in Russia.  Her father was a soccer coach and later\nworked for construction companies.  He became a citizen of Estonia without having to take the\nlanguage test as he was awarded citizenship in Estonia for his past sports achievements.  He receives\nbenefits from the Estonian government.  Both of her parents have been retired for ten years, but she\n\n4\nprovides some financial support of $100 per month.  (Exhibit 1, Answer; TR II 16, 35-36, 39-44)\nApplicant has three close friends in Estonia from her time at the university; they all teach at\na university or high school in Estonia.  She remains in touch with them, but she is no longer close\nto them.  (TR II 46-51)\nHer husband\u2019s parents and siblings are U.S. citizens.  (Exhibit 1; TR II 45)\nApplicant disclosed she has owned property in Estonia from January 1995 to present which\nis the apartment where she grew up.  Her parents who live there transferred ownership to her.  The\nvalue is approximately $100,000.  (Exhibit 1; Answer; TR II 51-52) She also owns a house in the\nU.S. with her husband; they purchased it for $550,00.  (TR II 53-54)\nWhile she also has taught English to the staff of the Embassy of Uzbekistan from January\n2003 to January 2007, she was not officially employed by the embassy.  She did this teaching once\na week as an extension of her work for Employer #2 as a favor for her boss who has dealt with the\nembassy to facilitate U.S. Department of State funded educational programs within that region.   She\ndid not receive any pay from the Embassy as she was teaching there as part of her duties to Employer\n#2.  She has not done this work for any other embassy.  (Answer; Exhibit 1; TR II 21, 55-60) When\nshe returns to her job from maternity leave, she initially testified that she was not certain over\nwhether or not to return to the work at the Embassy of Uzbekistan as it was not her primary duty. She\nlater clarified that she is willing to stop that teaching if it poses a conflict with her having a U.S.\nsecurity clearance.  (TR II 64-68)\nShe has returned to Estonia to visit her parents and friends in December 2002, March 2004,\nApril 2005 and in July 2007.  She had no contact with any foreign government officials on these\ntrips. She also visited Austria in September 2004 and disclosed other tourist trips and business trips\nto other countries..  (Exhibit 1; Answer; TR II 61-62)\nIs the foreign country known to target United States citizens \nto obtain protected information? \nThe Government provided for Administrative Notice several documents regarding Russia\nand Estonia.  The documents included a State Department Background Note on Russia, a country\nreport on human rights practices from 2006, a consular information sheet, a CRS Report for\nCongress, an annual report on foreign economic collection and industrial espionage, and an\nIntelligence Threat Handbook that included a section on Russia (\u201cThreat Handbook\u201d), a 2007\nDefense Intelligence Agency (DIA) report on threats, 2005-2006 Country Reports on Terrorism, a\nState Department speech, a background note on Estonia, a consular information sheet on Estonia,\na country human rights report on Estonia, and a State Department interview on Estonian-Russian\nRelations.  (AN I to XIV) \nThe government conceded that Applicant\u2019s mother has not had contact with Russia since she\nwas a child and that Estonia does not create much of a heightened risk from the U.S. perspective as\nit has favorable relations with the U.S. (TR II 73-74) \nEven with respect o Russian, a Deputy Assistant Secretary for European and Eurasian Affairs\n\n5\nremarked in 2007 that the U.S. relationship with Russia \u201ccannot be simplified to a sound bite. . . .\nThey are complicated and multidimensional.\u201d  (AN IX, page 7)\nEstonia is a stable democracy with a rapidly developing economy.  (AN XI) Estonia is a\nparliamentary democracy with a constitution ratified in 1992.  (AN X) The government generally\nrespects human rights of citizens and the large ethnic Russian noncitizen community.  (AN XII)\nIn May 2007 an Assistant Secretary of State for European and Eurasian Affairs commented\non Estonian TV, \u201cone of the things I find most encouraging about Estonia is how much of a success\nyou have made with reform, with modernity, with your place in Europe, and how confident your\nnation is becoming as you make a success out of your freedom\u201d (AN XIII)\nPOLICIES\nEnclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to consider in evaluating an\nindividual's security eligibility.  They are divided into conditions that could raise a security concern\nand may be disqualifying and conditions that could mitigate security concerns in deciding whether\nto grant or continue an individual's access to classified information.  But the mere presence or\nabsence of any given adjudication policy condition is not decisive.  Based on a consideration of the\nevidence as a whole in evaluating this case, I weighed relevant Adjudication Guidelines as set forth\nbelow :\nThe responsibility for producing evidence initially falls on the Government to demonstrate\nthat it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant's access to\nclassified information.  Then the Applicant presents evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or\nmitigate in order  to overcome the doubts raised by the Government, and to demonstrate persuasively\nthat it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue the clearance.  \nUnder the provisions of Executive Order 10865, as amended, and the Directive, a decision\nto grant or continue an applicant's security clearance may be made only after an affirmative finding\nthat to do so is clearly consistent with the national interest. In reaching the fair and impartial overall\ncommon sense determination, the Administrative Judge may  draw only those inferences and\nconclusions that have a reasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record.\nCONCLUSIONS\nForeign Influence\nGuideline B\n\n       7. Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include:  \n4\n(a.)  contact with a foreign family member, business or professional associate, friend, or a person  who is a\ncitizen of or resident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation,\ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion;  \n(e.)  A substantial business, financial, or property interest in a foreign country. . . .which could subject the\nindividual to heightened risk of foreign influence or exploitation.\n       8.  Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include: \n5\n(a.)  the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which these persons are located, or\nthe positions or activities of those persons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be\nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, group, organization,\nor government and the interests of the U.S.\n(c.) contact and correspondence with foreign citizens is so casual and infrequent that there is little likelihood\nthat it could create a risk for foreign influence or exploitation;\n(e.)  The individual has promptly complied with existing agency requirements regarding the reporting of\ncontacts, requests, or threats from persons, groups or organizations from a foreign country;\n(f.)  the value or routine nature of the foreign business, financial, or property interests is such that they are\nunlikely to result in a conflict and could not be used effectively to influence, manipulate or pressure the\nindividual.\n6\n6. The concern:  Foreign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the\nindividual has divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or\ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way that\nis not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by any foreign\ninterest.  Adjudication under this Guideline can and should consider the identity of\nthe foreign country in which the foreign contact or financial interest is located,\nincluding , but not limited to, such considerations as to whether the foreign country\nis known to target United States citizens to obtain protected information and/or is\nassociated with a risk of terrorism.  \nThe Government raised concerns over possible foreign influence because of Applicant's close\nties of affection to Estonia as both her mother and father are residents of Estonia (the father is a\ncitizen of Estonia and the mother is a citizen of Russia but has not lived there since she was a child).\nAlso, Applicant owns an apartment (valued at $100,000) in Estonia where she grew up and where\nher parents still live.  Applicant traveled to Estonia in December 2002, March 2004, April 2005, and\nJuly 2007.  Security concerns raised under Guideline B, Foreign Influence, require an assessment\nunder disqualifying condition (DC) 7.(a.) of the security risk  that may exist when an individual's\n4\nfamily member \u201cis a citizen of or resident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened\nrisk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion.\u201d   The government\nconceded that the mother\u2019s childhood ties to Russia are remote and that the country of Estonia does\nnot raise a \u201cheightened risk.\u201d Given the fact that both her relatives are retired, they seem an unlikely\ntarget of the government of Estonia, with whom the U.S. has friendly relations.  Under DC 7.(e.)\nApplicant disclosed she owns an apartment in Estonia; however, she and her husband have\nsubstantial assets in the U.S. \nWhile I have considered these concerns, I conclude Applicant has presented evidence to meet\nthe burden of mitigating  those circumstances either under the mitigating conditions (MC) outlined\n5\n\n7\nin the revised guidelines or by a whole person analysis. While there are concerns over Russia\u2019s\neconomic espionage and human rights record, I conclude the ties to Russia of the mother are so\ntangential that any risk would appear to be slight and clearly manageable under MC (a.).  Applicant\nis a U.S. citizen who married here, was educated here, works here, and now has a child born in the\nU.S.  Given Applicant\u2019s deep ties to the U.S., there is no evidence that she would have any\nmotivation to assist Russia or Estonia if their interests were different from the U.S.  Thus, I find\nthere is no substantial likelihood that she would be subject to duress merely because of these family\nties.  While she traveled to Estonia, that travel alone does not raise a security concern.  Since\nbecoming a U.S. citizen, her trips were with her U.S. passport.  \nHer ownership of an apartment where her parents live is not a \u201csubstantial business, financial,\nor property interest in a foreign country. . . .which could subject the individual to heightened risk of\nforeign influence or exploitation.\u201d  Applicant and her husband purchased a home in the U.S. worth\nmore than five times the value of the Estonian property, so proportionately it does not raise a security\nconcern.   Consequently, in comparing the value of the property to their other assets, they fall within\nMC (f.) as  the value of the foreign financial interests is such that they are unlikely to result in a\nconflict and could not be used effectively to influence, manipulate or pressure the individual.  \nAlso I have evaluated her under the whole person adjudicative process guidelines:  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances\nsurrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency\nand recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the\nconduct; (5) the voluntariness of the participation; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the\nconduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the\nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  (AG 2. Adjudication Process)\nLooking at all of these circumstances, I conclude Applicant has overcome  foreign influence\nsecurity concerns.  Given her strong and lengthy ties to the U.S. since 2001 and since she became\na U.S. naturalized citizen in 2005, there is limited potential for coercion, exploitation or duress with\nEstonia, an ally of the U.S., or Russia, as those ties are remote.   After a review of all of the evidence,\nI conclude there is little  potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress. \nSecurity clearance decisions are predictive judgments about an applicant's security eligibility\nin light of the applicant's past conduct and present circumstances.  Department of Navy v. Egan, 484\nU.S. 518, 528-29 (1988).  Contacts with citizens of other countries are relevant to security\ndeterminations only if they make an individual potentially vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or\npressure through threats against those foreign relatives.  Acts indicative of foreign influence warrant\ncareful scrutiny.  After considering the Adjudicative Process factors and the Adjudicative Guidelines,\nI conclude these ties are not of such a nature as to create any tangible risks of undue pressure on\nApplicant, so foreign influence security concerns are mitigated.  Thus, I resolve SOR paragraph 1\nand subparagraphs 1.a. through 1.e. in Applicant's favor.\nOutside Activities\n36. The Concern.  Involvement in certain types of outside employment or activities\n\n8\nis of security concern if it poses a conflict of interest with an individual\u2019s security\nresponsibilities and could create an increased risk of unauthorized disclosure of\nclassified information.  \nUnder Guideline L, conduct involving certain types of outside employment or activities raise\na security concern if it poses a conflict of interest with an individual\u2019s security responsibilities and\ncould create an increased risk of unauthorized disclosure of classified information. In this case\nApplicant was not employed by a foreign embassy though she had disclosed she taught English to\nthe staff.  She believed she was merely doing a favor for her supervisor in teaching English at a\nforeign embassy as she was not paid by the embassy for this work.  Under disqualifying condition\n37.(a)(1) security concerns are raised over either compensated or volunteer employment or service\nwith the government of a foreign country.  However, she fully disclosed this outside activity on her\nSF 86.\nUnder 38.(b) Applicant has now mitigated the concerns as she discontinued the activity upon\nbeing notified that it was in conflict with his or her security responsibilities.  She has not had any\ncontact with the embassy since January 2007 when she went on maternity leave.  Now that she\nunderstands the conflict, she testified credibly that she is willing to terminate this relationship.  At\nthe time she was doing this teaching, she had no security clearance and was not advised of the\nconflict.\nAn administrative judge must consider the record evidence as a whole to determine whether\nthere is direct or circumstantial evidence concerning an applicant\u2019s intent or state of mind at the time\nthe conduct occurred.  Based on Applicant\u2019s credible testimony and review of her as a whole person,\nI conclude that Guideline L in favor of Applicant.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nAfter reviewing the allegations of the SOR in the context of the Adjudicative Guidelines in\nEnclosure 2 and the factors set forth under the Adjudicative Process section, I make the following\nformal findings:\nParagraph 1.

CREAN\nAPPEARANCES\nFOR GOVERNMENT\nJames F. Duffy, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nSYNOPSIS\nApplicant is a junior analysis for a defense contractor.  In completing his security clearance\napplication and in responding to interrogatories asked during the clearance process, Applicant\n\nItem 5, at 1-5.\n1\nItem 10, at 6.\n2\n2\ndeliberately did not provide correct information concerning his use of illegal drugs and a driving\nwhile intoxicated arrest and detention.  Clearance is denied.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn December 7, 2006, the Defense Office of Hearing and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its decision to deny a security clearance for\nApplicant.  The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information\nwithin Industry (February 20, 1990), as amended, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6,\nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended\n(Directive), using the new Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December\n29, 2005, and implemented by the Department of Defense on September 1, 2006.  Applicant was\nprovided copies of the new guidelines.  Applicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on December\n14, 2006.  The SOR alleges security concerns under Guideline E (Personal Conduct) of the Directive.\nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on January 2, 2007.  He admitted three and denied\ntwo of the allegations with explanation.  He elected to have the matter decided on the written record\nin lieu of a hearing.\nDepartment Counsel submitted the Government\u2019s written case on May 31, 2007.  Applicant\nreceived a complete file of relevant material (FORM) on June 5, 2007, and was provided the\nopportunity to file objections and submit material to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the disqualifying\nconditions.  His response was due July 5, 2007.  As of August 13, 2007, he had not responded.  The\ncase was assigned to me on August 15, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant is 31 years old and has been a junior analyst for a defense contractor since\nDecember 2003.  He received a college degree in August 2003, and is married with three children.\nHe submitted a security clearance application in 2004.1\nApplicant admitted that in July 1996, as a 20-year-old dependant of a military member, he\nwas apprehended by military police for driving under the influence of alcohol following an\nautomobile accident.  Applicant was taken to the military police station, refused to take a\nBreathalyzer test, and released to his father\u2019s custody.  His driving privilege for military installations\nwas revoked for a year.   Applicant admitted the incident happened but that he was not arrested or\n2\ndetained.  He was not required to appear in court.  The revocation of his driving privileges was\n\nItem 4, at 2.\n3\nId. at 1.\n4\nItem 4 at 8.\n5\nItem 4, and Item 12.\n6\nItem 4 at 2-3.\n7\nItems 6 and 7.\n8\nIt is noted that the initial security clearance application submitted by Applicant in 1997 listed his place of birth\n9\nas the same location noted in Item 9.\nItem 9.\n10\nItem 7 at 3.\n11\n3\nprocessed by administrative action.   \n3\nApplicant admits that in 2002, while on active duty, he was apprehended for driving under\nthe influence.  He was sentenced by civilian authorities to jail, serving three days, and was fined. \nHis licensed was revoked, he attended alcohol awareness classes, and he was placed on probation\nfor three years.4\nApplicant completed a security clearance application on April 13, 2004.  He listed only his\n2002 conviction for driving while intoxicated in response to question 24 asking if he had ever been\ncharged with or convicted of an offense(s) related to alcohol and drugs.   In response to\n5\ninterrogatories from DOHA, Applicant admitted he failed to list the offense on the application, but\ndenied that he tried to hid the incident.  He stated that he freely admitted to the offense in the past\nand had listed it on a previous security clearance application submitted in November 1997 while in\nthe Army.   He explained that it was not included on the 2004 security clearance application because\n6\nhe simply forgot about the offense.7\nIn response to interrogatories from DOHA, Applicant stated he never used illegal drugs.8\nHowever, the Government presented a statement concerning Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI)\nautomated records showing that an individual with Applicant\u2019s name,  social security number, date\nof birth, but a different place of birth, submitted an on-line application on December 16, 2003, for\na special agent position with the FBI.   On the application, the individual applying for the special\n9\nagent position answered \u201cYES\u201d to questions asking if he used any illegal drug(s) or combination of\nillegal drugs, other than marijuana , more than five times during his lifetime or in the last ten years.10\nApplicant stated he does not recall ever applying to be a special agent for the FBI.  He submitted\napplications to numerous agencies during this time.  He does not know the steps to apply for\nemployment with the FBI and never spoke with an FBI recruiter.  He does not remember receiving\nany mail from them.11\nApplicant stated that his answers to the interrogatories that he never used drugs were correct.\n\nItem 6 at 6.\n12\nDepartment of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988).\n13\nDirective \u00b6 E2.2.1.\n14\nDirective \u00b6 2(a)6.3.1 through \u00b6 6.3.6.\n15\nAG \u00b6 2(a).\n16\nId.\n17\nSee Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7.\n18\n4\nApplicant had always received negative results from randomly drug tested during his six years in the\nArmy.  He attended alcohol and drug prevention classes because of his driving while intoxicated\noffense, was tested, and was never positive for drug use.  He had friends offer him drugs in the past,\nbut he always declined the offers.  \n12\nPOLICIES\nThe President has \u201cthe authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national\nsecurity and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position . . .\nthat will give that person access to such information.\u201d   Eligibility for a security clearance is\n13\npredicated upon the applicant meeting the security guidelines contained in the Directive.14\nThe Directive sets out the adjudicative guidelines for determining eligibility for access to\nclassified information, and lists the disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions for each\nguideline.  Each clearance decision must be fair, impartial, and a commonsense decision based on the\nrelevant and material facts and circumstances, the whole person concept, and the factors listed in the\nDirective.15\nThe adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make\nan affirmative determination that the person is eligible for a security clearance.  An administrative\njudge must apply the \u201cwhole person concept,\u201d and consider and carefully weigh the available, reliable\ninformation about the person.   An administrative judge should consider: (1) the nature, extent, and\n16\nseriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the applicant\u2019s age and maturity at the\ntime of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation\nand other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for\npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation of recurrence.17\nA person granted access to classified information enters into a special relationship with the\ngovernment.  The government must be able to repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those\nindividuals to whom it grants access to classified information.  The decision to deny an individual a\nsecurity clearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant.   It is merely\n18\nan indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of\nDefense have established for issuing a clearance.\n\nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14.\n19\nISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002); see Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n20\nISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \n21\nISCR Case No. 99-0597 (App. Bd. Dec 13, 2000).\n22\nISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996) (quoting DISCR Case No. 92-1106 (App. Bd. Oct. 7,\n23\n1993))\nEgan, 484 U.S. at 531; see Directive \u00b6 E2.2.2.\n24\nAG \u00b6 15.\n25\n5\nInitially, the Government must present evidence to establish controverted facts in the SOR that\ndisqualify or may disqualify the Applicant from being eligible for access to classified information.19\nThereafter, Applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate\nfacts.   An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the\n20\nnational interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d   The government is under no duty to\n21\npresent evidence to disprove any Adjudicative Guideline mitigating condition, and an administrative\njudge cannot assume or infer that any particular mitigating condition is applicable merely because the\ngovernment does not present evidence to disprove that particular mitigating condition.   \u201c[T]he\n22\nDirective presumes there is a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the\ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability.\u201d   \u201cAny doubt as to whether access to\n23\nclassified information is clearly consistent with national security will be resolved in favor of the\nnational security.\u201d 24\nBased upon a consideration of the evidence, I find the following adjudicative guideline most\npertinent to the evaluation of the facts in this case:\nGuideline E - Personal Conduct: Conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor,\ndishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions about an\nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information.  Of special interest\nis any failure to provide truthful and candid answers during the security clearance process or any other\nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.25\nConditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying, as well as those which\nwould mitigate security concerns, pertaining to the adjudicative guideline are set forth and discussed\nin the conclusions section below.\nCONCLUSIONS\nI carefully considered all of the factors in evidence and the legal standards discussed above.\nI reach the following conclusions regarding the allegations in the SOR.\nApplicant\u2019s detention in 1996 for driving under the influence, and his arrest and conviction for\ndriving under the influence in 2002 were raised as Personal Conduct allegations under Guideline E.\n\n10 U.S. C. \u00a7 1001.\n26\n6\nThese offenses are not of the nature considered as Personal Conduct security concerns under Guideline\nE.  The offenses are properly security concerns  under Guideline G (Alcohol Consumption).  The\noffense of driving while intoxicated is an example in the disqualifying conditions under Guideline G\nof alcohol-related incidents away from work.  However, the mitigating conditions under both\nGuideline E and Guideline G are similar.  Under Guideline E, Personal Conduct Mitigating Condition\n(PC MC) \u00b6 17(c) (the offenses is no minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is so\ninfrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast\ndoubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment) is the same as Guideline G\nAlcohol Consumption Mitigating Condition (AC MC) \u00b6 23(a) (So much time has passed, or the\nbehavior was so infrequent, or it happened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to\nrecur or does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment).\nAs such, Applicant has presented sufficient information to mitigate any security concerns for the\noffenses under both Guidelines E and G.  The offenses are 11 and 5 years ago.  There were only two\noffenses in a 11 year period.  There has not been any other alcohol-related offense and five years have\npassed since the last offense.  Alcohol-related incidents away from work under the circumstances are\nnot likely to recur.  In addition, the offenses do not cast doubt on Applicant\u2019s current reliability,\ntrustworthiness, or good judgment because of the infrequency of the offenses and the amount of time\nthat has passed since the last offense.  Applicant has mitigated security concerns for the two driving\nwhile intoxicated offenses, listed as SOR allegations 1. a, and 1.b.\nApplicant\u2019s false response to questions concerning drug use on interrogatories and on a security\nclearance application, and his failure to list his 1996 driving while intoxicated offense on both his 2004\nsecurity clearance application and in response to interrogatories, raises Personal Conduct Disqualifying\nCondition (PC DC) \u00b6 16(a) (the deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant and\nmaterial facts from the personal security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used\nto conduct investigations . . . determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness).  Personal\nconduct is always a security concern because it asks the central question does the person\u2019s past conduct\njustify confidence the person can be trusted to properly safeguard classified information.  The security\nclearance system depends on an individual providing correct and accurate information.  If a person\nconceals or provides false information, the security clearance process cannot function properly to\nensure that granting access to classified information is in the best interest of the United States\nGovernment.  A deliberate omission or false statement on a security clearance application is a criminal\noffense under federal law.   \n26\nThe information concerning Applicant\u2019s drug use was contained in an on-line application to\nbe a FBI special agent.  The application was for an individual with the same name, social security\nnumber, and date and place of birth as Applicant.  It was submitted on December 16, 2003, shortly\nafter applicant had either received a college degree or left college.  It was submitted during the time\nApplicant was seeking employment.  He started employment with his present company in December\n2003.  I find that the FBI on-line application was submitted by Applicant.  He answered \u201cyes\u201d to the\nquestions concerning illegal drug use.  An applicant for a position with the FBI would not list his use\nof illegal drug unless it were true.  Applicant\u2019s admission that he used illegal drugs on the FBI\napplication is sufficient to establish he used illegal drugs.  At the time he completed the security\nclearance application and answered the interrogatories, Applicant knew he had used illegal drugs and\nhis answers that he did not use illegal drugs were deliberately false and misleading.  Similarly,\n\n7\nApplicant knew he had been charged with an alcohol-related offense in 1996.  He may not have been\nconvicted of the offense because the only consequence to the offense was the revocation of his on-post\ndriving privileges, but he was apprehended and taken to the military police station.  This was similar\nto an arrest.  Applicant listed this offense on an earlier security clearance application, indicating he\nknew it was a security concern.  Applicant deliberately failed to provide accurate and truthful answers\nto the alcohol and drug questions involved in determining security worthiness. \nI have considered all of the Personal Conduct Mitigating Conditions.  Applicant has never\nacknowledged his illegal drug use so PC MC \u00b6 17(a) (The individual made prompt, good-faith efforts\nto correct the omission, concealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts) does not\napply.  Applicant deliberately did not provide correct information on a security clearance application\ncompleted in 2004, and interrogatories signed in August 2005 and January 2006, so PC MC \u00b6 179(c)\n(The offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is so infrequent, or it happened\nunder such unique circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s\nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment) does not apply.  The deliberately false answers were\nprovided during the most recent security clearance process, the false answers were provided on two\nseparate documents, and there is no information indicating that it would not recur.  Applicant has not\npresented sufficient information to rebut the allegation of deliberately providing false information on\nhis security clearance application or in response to interrogatories.\nI have considered Applicant\u2019s conduct under the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept.  Applicant\ndeliberately did not provide requested information in response to questions asked during the security\nclearance process.  If he cannot be trusted to provide accurate information, he cannot be trusted to\nsafeguard classified information.  I find he is not eligible for access to classified information.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required\nby Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive are;\nParagraph 1, Guideline E:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a.:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b.:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c.:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d.:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e.:\nAgainst Applicant\nThomas M.

Edmunds, Esquire, Applicant\u2019s Counsel\nSYNOPSIS\nThe Applicant has initiated the renunciation of his Israeli citizenship, and has surrendered\nhis Israeli passport.  The Applicant\u2019s parents, two sisters, and mother-in-laws are citizens of and\nreside in Israel.  However, his wife, and two children are all American citizens.  His financial\ninterests are also all in the U.S.  The Applicant has lived in the U.S. for over 26 years.  He became\na U.S. citizen in 1991, and has held a security clearance since 1995.  As the Applicant has\n\u201clongstanding relationships and loyalties in the U.S.,\u201d it is unlikely that he \u201cwill be placed in a\nposition of having to choose between the interests of . . . [his foreign relatives] . . . and the interests\nof the U.S.\u201d  Mitigation is shown.  Clearance is granted.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn January 16, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to\n\n2\nExecutive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2,\n1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant, which detailed the reasons why DOHA\ncould not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant and\nrecommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether a clearance should be denied\nor revoked.\nApplicant filed an Answer to the SOR on February 7, 2007.\nThe case was received by the undersigned on March 22, 2007.  A notice of hearing was\nissued on March 27, 2007, and the case was heard on April 25, 2007.  The Government submitted\ndocumentary evidence.  Testimony was taken from the Applicant, who also submitted documentary\nevidence, and called five witnesses to testify on his behalf.  The transcript (TR) was received on May\n4, 2007.  The issues raised here are whether the Applicant's perceived Foreign Preference and\nForeign Influence militate against the granting of a security clearance.  [The Applicant admits the\nunderlying factual basis of all of the allegations.]\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nThe following Findings of Fact are based on Applicant's Answer to the SOR, the documents\nand the live testimony.  The Applicant is 51 years of age, has a Master\u2019s degree from an American\nuniversity, and is employed by a defense contractor who seeks a security clearance on behalf of the\nApplicant.  After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due\nconsideration of the same, I make the following additional findings of fact.\nGuideline C - Foreign Preference\nThe Applicant came to the U.S. from Israel in 1980, over 26 years ago, to attend an American\nuniversity (TR at page 80 lines 16~24).  He obtained \u201cboth a Bachelor\u2019s and a Master\u2019s [degree]\nthere\u201d (Id).  He became a U.S. citizen in 1991, and has held a security clearance since 1995 (TR at\npage 77 lines 14~23, and at page 80 line 25 to page 82 line 20).  The Applicant\u2019s wife, and two\nchildren are also American citizens (Government Exhibit (GX) 1 at pages 4 and 5).  His financial\ninterests are also all in the U.S. (TR at page 74 lines 10~18, and at page 85 lines 3~25).\n1.a.~1.f.  The Applicant has initiated the renunciation of his Israeli citizenship, and has\nsurrendered his Israeli passport (TR at page 78 lines 1~10, and Applicant\u2019s Exhibit (AppX) L).  The\nApplicant had used that passport to travel to Israel in 1998, 1999, 2001, 2003, 2005 and 2006 (TR\nat page 94 lines 8~18).  As he held a security clearance, he was briefed appropriately as to his\nreporting requirements prior to each trip (TR at page 75 line 16 to page 76 line 2, and at page 94 line\n19 to page 95 line 21).  The Applicant reported the birth of his two native born American children\nto the Israeli Consulate in 1988 and again in 1991 (TR at page 76 lines 6~21, and GX 1 at page 5).\nHe owns no property in Israel (TR at page 74 lines 10~18, and at page 85 lines 3~25).\nGuideline B - Foreign Influence\n2.a. and 2.b.  The Applicant\u2019s parents, two sisters, and mother-in-laws are citizens of and\nreside in Israel (GX 1 at pages 4~5).  The Applicant\u2019s elderly parents and two sisters all work in the\n\n3\ninsurance business (TR at page 78 lines 14~21, at page 87 line 25 to page 88 line 4, at page 88 line\n16 to page 90 line 1).  The Applicant\u2019s 80 year old mother-in-law is a retired typist (TR at page 76\nline 22 to page 77 line 8, and at page 90 lines 2~4).  None of the Applicant\u2019s foreign relatives have\nany connection with a foreign government (TR at page 96 line 17 to page 97 line 3).  Furthermore,\nthe Applicant is not subject to coercion vis-a-vis any of these Israeli relatives (TR at page 74 lines\n3~9, and at page 75 line 15).\nAs the Applicant has Israeli relatives, I must also consider the country of Israel.  Israel is a\nparliamentary democracy who\u2019s prime minister heads the government and exercises executive\npower.  Israel has a diversified, technologically advanced economy that is growing at about 5.2% per\nyear, and the U.S. is Israel\u2019s largest trading partner.  Almost half of Israel\u2019s exports are high tech and\nits major industrial sectors include high-technology electrical and biomedical equipment.  The\nNational Counterintelligence Center\u2019s 2000 Report to Congress on Foreign Economic Collection and\nIndustrial Espionage lists Israel as one of the active collectors of proprietary information.  The most\nrecent Report, released in 2006, states that the major collectors remain active.  Israeli military\nofficers have been implicated in this type of technology collection in the U.S. (See the Government\u2019s\nRequest for Administrative Notice at pages 1 and 5).\nPOLICIES\nEnclosure 2 and Section E.2.2. of the 1992 Directive set forth both policy factors, and\nconditions that could raise or mitigate a security concern.  Furthermore, as set forth in the Directive,\neach clearance decision must be a fair and impartial common sense determination based upon\nconsideration of all the relevant and material information and the pertinent criteria and adjudication\npolicy in enclosure 2, including as appropriate:\na. Nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct, and surrounding\ncircumstances.\nb. Frequency and recency of the conduct.\nc. Age and maturity of the applicant.\nd. Motivation of the applicant, and the extent to which the conduct\nwas negligent, willful, voluntary, or undertaken with knowledge of\nthe consequence involved.\ne. Absence or presence of rehabilitation.\nf. Probability that circumstances or conduct will continue or recur in\nthe future.\u201d\nThe Administrative Judge, however, can only draw those inferences or conclusions that have\na reasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record.  The Judge cannot draw inferences or\nconclusions based on evidence that is speculative or conjectural in nature.\n\n4\nThe Government must make out a case under Guideline B (Foreign Influence) and Guideline\nC (Foreign Preference), which establishes doubt about a person's judgment, reliability and\ntrustworthiness.  While a rational connection, or nexus, must be shown between an applicant's\nadverse conduct and his ability to effectively safeguard classified information, with respect to\nsufficiency of proof of a rational connection, objective or direct evidence is not required.\nThen, the Applicant must remove that doubt with substantial evidence in refutation,\nexplanation, mitigation or extenuation, which demonstrates that the past adverse conduct is unlikely\nto be repeated, and that the Applicant presently qualifies for a security clearance.\nAn individual who has demonstrated a Foreign Preference or who is subject to Foreign\nInfluence, may be prone to provide information or make decisions that are harmful to the interests\nof the United States.  The Government must be able to place a high degree of confidence in a\nsecurity clearance holder to abide by all security rules and regulations at all times and in all places.\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe Applicant, until recently, was a dual national with Israel, and maintained an Israeli\npassport.  The first disqualifying condition under Foreign Preference is therefore applicable as there\nwas an \"exercise of any right . . . of foreign citizenship after becoming a U.S. citizen . . . .  This\nincludes but is not limited to: (1) possession of a current foreign passport; . . .\"  This is countered,\nhowever, by the second and fifth mitigating conditions. \u201c[T]he individual has expressed a\nwillingness to renounce dual citizenship,\u201d and \u201cthe passport has been . . . otherwise invalidated.\u201d\nHere, the Applicant has not only initiated the renunciation of his Israeli citizenship, but has also\nsurrendered his Israeli passport.\nThe Applicant's parents, two sisters and his mother-in-law  are citizens of and reside in Israel.\nThe first and second disqualifying conditions are arguably applicable as this contact \u201ccreates a\nheightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion,\" and creates\n\u201ca potential conflict of interests between the individual\u2019s obligation to protect sensitive information\nor technology and the individual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person . . . by providing that information.\u201d\nUnder the facts of this particular case, however, these are clearly countered by the first and second\nmitigating conditions.  The nature of the Applicant\u2019s relationship with his Israeli relatives is \u201csuch\nthat it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a position of having to choose between the interests\nof . . . [his family] and the interests of the U.S.\u201d  Also, the Applicant \u201chas such deep and\nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve\nany conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest.\u201d\nFurthermore, I am not limited to the mitigating conditions, delineated in the Directive, in\ndeciding if an Applicant has demonstrated extenuation or mitigation.  Those who work with and/or\nsupervise the Applicant testified most favorably as to his trustworthiness (TR at page 24 line 20 to\npage 30 line 8, at page 32 line 5 to page 38 line 14, at page 40 line 12 to page 50 line 5, at page 52\nline 5 to page 56 line 11, and at page 59 line 6 to page 69 line 8).  The totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and circumstances, as set forth at length above, clearly warrants a favorable recommendation\nunder the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d  Mitigation is shown.  Guidelines B and C are found for the\nApplicant.\n\n5\nConsidering all the evidence, the Applicant has rebutted the Government's case regarding his\nForeign Influence.  The Applicant has thus met the mitigating conditions of Guidelines B and C, and\nof Section E.2.2. of the Directive.  Accordingly, he has met his ultimate burden of persuasion under\nGuidelines B and C.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal Findings required by paragraph 25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive are:\nParagraph 1: Foreign Preference\nFOR THE APPLICANT\na.   For the Applicant.\nb.   For the Applicant.\nc.   For the Applicant.\nd.   For the Applicant.\ne.   For the Applicant.\nf.   For the Applicant.\nParagraph 2: Foreign Influence\nFOR THE APPLICANT\na.   For the Applicant.\nb.   For the Applicant.\nFactual support and reasons for the foregoing are set forth in FINDINGS OF FACT and\nCONCLUSIONS, supra.\nDECISION\nIn light of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly consistent with\nthe national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant.\nRichard A.

Grisham, Esq.\nSYNOPSIS\n\n2\nApplicant\u2019s excessive alcohol consumption has been mitigated by his successful completion\nof 16 weeks of treatment and aftercare in February 2004. Though Applicant was drinking then\narrested in March 2005 after he completed aftercare, he was not driving nor was he acting in a way\nto support the charges. More importantly, the charges were dismissed. The record of excessive\nalcohol consumption against Applicant has also been mitigated by the passage of more than two\nyears since his last alcohol-related incident. Clearance is granted. \nSTATEMENT OF CASE\nOn January 10, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, dated January 2, 1992, as reissued through Change 4\nthereto, dated April 20, 1999, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant indicating that\nbased on alcohol consumption (Guideline G), DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative\nfinding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue\na security clearance for Applicant. DOHA recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to\nconduct proceedings and determine whether clearance should be granted, continued, denied or\nrevoked. On March 22, 2007, Applicant responded to the SOR and requested a hearing before an\nAdministrative Judge. \nOn May 9, 2007, this case was assigned to me. On July 10, 2007, this case was scheduled for\nhearing on July 31, 2007. The Government submitted two exhibits (GE), and Applicant submitted\neight exhibits (AE) that have been admitted in evidence. Testimony was taken from Applicant. The\ntranscript (Tr.) was received on August 15, 2007. \nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant, single, is 23 years old and employed as systems integration and test engineer with\na defense contractor. He has been employed in the position since May 2007. Before May 2007,\nApplicant worked at a similar position for another defense contractor (Tr. 37) while completing his\ncollege curriculum. \nParagraph 1 of the SOR contains four allegations relating to alcohol consumption (Guideline\nG). Applicant admitted all allegations with explanations. Under subparagraph 1.a., Applicant\nindicated that the January 2003 alcohol-related incident and subsequent counseling convinced him\nto reduce his alcohol consumption. In addition, he does not operate an auto if he has been drinking.\nApplicant realizes he made a serious mistake on January 20, 2003, when he drove home after\nconsuming alcohol (subparagraph 1.b.). Applicant admitted receiving counseling (subparagraph 1.c.)\nfor alcohol abuse. Significantly, he was not found to be suffering from a more serious alcohol\nproblem like alcoholism or alcohol dependence. On March 25, 2005,Applicant was arrested for\nresisting arrest without violence, and disorderly intoxication (subparagraph 1.d.). While he had been\ndrinking before the confrontation with the police, he was not intoxicated. Moreover, the charges\nwere dismissed. \n\n3\nBefore the driving while under the influence of alcohol (DUI) offense in January 2003,\nApplicant described his drinking (subparagraph 1.a.) as weekend only due to the fact he was\nunderage; and his access to alcohol was much more limited. After consuming about three or four\ndrinks at a sports bar on January 20, 2003, Applicant got into his car and began driving home. On\nhis way, he failed to yield the right of way and was stopped by the police. The officer asked him to\ntake a blood-alcohol test. He refused because he was under age when stopped and assumed a failed\ntest would make a regrettable situation even worse. Applicant was arrested for DUI (subparagraph\n1.b.). After pleading no contest, he was placed on 12 months probation, his driver\u2019s license was\nsuspended, and he was ordered to attend alcohol counseling.\nApplicant was referred to the counseling agency on June 30, 2003. (AE A) After Applicant\nindicated his last alcohol use was in July 2003, the licensed clinical social worker (LCSW)\nadministered some tests. When those tests showed Applicant susceptible on at least one level for\nsubstance dependence, and on two levels for alcohol abuse, the counselor recommended Applicant\nfor counseling. (Tr. 40) He received counseling (subparagraph 1.c.) from July 2003 to February\n2004. \nThe counseling consisted of 12 weeks of group sessions and two months of aftercare.\nApplicant also attended 22 twelve-step meetings, a critical part of the Alcoholics Anonymous (AA)\nrecovery program. During the course of group therapy, Applicant learned about the course of\nalcoholism as a disease, denial, the basic skills of recovery and relapse prevention. Applicant tested\nnegative on four random alcohol tests. The LCSW noted that Applicant met the requirements of his\nprogram and furnished a good prognosis. (AE A) Significantly, the LCSW  allowed him to end his\ncounseling early because she concluded he understood the objectives of his counseling. (Tr. 32-34)\nAfter an unknown period of regular attendance in AA, Applicant\u2019s belief he had his drinking under\ncontrol convinced him to stop attending AA sometime in 2004. \nOn March 25, 2005, Applicant rode downtown on a bus with friends to celebrate another\nfriend\u2019s birthday. He had three or four drinks. At some point in the evening, Applicant and a group\nof friends decided to go to another location in another friend\u2019s car. This friend, who Applicant\nthought was also the designated driver, failed to yield and was stopped by the police. The driver was\narrested after the officer thought he had been drinking. The other occupants of the car got out and\nbegan walking away from the car when they concluded the driver would be arrested. Some of them\nbecame belligerent and began shouting profane language at the police officer. The officer thought\nApplicant was one of the shouters of profanity. The officer arrested him after he asked why he was\nbeing arrested. Applicant was arrested and charged with resisting arrest without violence and\ndisorderly intoxication. A no information was filed on both charges. The charges were dismissed.\n(Tr. 29-30) Applicant\u2019 believes the arresting officer overreacted.\nApplicant\u2019s testimony reflects that he has resumed using alcohol sporadically since the 2005\nincident. Although he did not provide much detail about his present consumption, his counseling has\nconvinced him of the necessity to maintain control over alcohol use when he does drink. His last\nalcohol use was about two months before the hearing. (Tr. 36)\nAll of Applicant\u2019s character references come from his previous employer before he was hired\nby his current employer in May 2007. Two former officials considered Applicant to be a superb\nemployee and a diligent worker. One former coworker, who knew Applicant at work and in school,\n\n4\nassessed Applicant as a real professional and welcomed his contributions to the overall success of\nthe mission. Applicant\u2019s former supervisor extolled Applicant\u2019s team worker attitude while working\non projects. \nHaving weighed Applicant\u2019s demeanor and conduct with the information he provided to the\nreferral counselor, there is some discrepancy as when Applicant resumed alcohol use after his DUI\narrest in January 2003. I attribute the discrepancy to nervousness by Applicant rather than an attempt\nto misrepresent the times in which he used alcohol after the January 2003 DUI offense.\nPOLICIES\nEnclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth guidelines containing disqualifying conditions (DC)\nand mitigating conditions (MC) that should be given binding consideration in making security\nclearance determinations. These conditions must be considered in every case along with the general\nfactors of the whole person concept. However, the conditions are not automatically determinative\nof the decision in any case nor can they supersede the Administrative Judge's reliance on his own\ncommon sense. \nBurden of Proof\nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, that conditions exist in the\npersonal or professional history of the applicant which disqualifies, or may disqualify, the applicant\nfrom being eligible for access to classified information. See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484\nU.S. 518, 531 (1988) \u201c[T]he Directive presumes there is a nexus or rational connection between\nproven conduct under any of the Criteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability.\u201d ISCR\nCase No. 95-0611 at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996) (quoting DISCR Case No. 92-1106 (App. Bd. Oct.\n7, 1993)). \nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial evidence, the\nburden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts. \u201c[S]ecurity clearance\ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d See Egan, 481 U.S. at 531; see\nDirective E2.2.2.\nAlcohol Consumption\nExcessive alcohol consumption impairs judgment and can raise security concerns about an\nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness. \nCONCLUSIONS\nExcessive alcohol use can pervade other aspects of a person\u2019s life in a negative way. The\nabusive level of alcohol use can lead to minimization and denial of the harmful consequences that\nconsumption may be having on various aspects of a person\u2019s life, including the person\u2019s health.\nApplicant\u2019s alcohol problem raises security concerns under alcohol consumption (AC) disqualifying\ncondition (DC) 22.a. (alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as DUI, fighting, child or\n\n5\nspouse abuse . . . regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol\ndependent) and 22.e. (evaluation of alcohol abuse or alcohol dependence by and a licensed clinical\nsocial worker who is a staff member of a recognized alcohol treatment program) The DUI offense\n(January 2003) described in subparagraphs 1.b. was an alcohol-related incident away from work.\nApplicant pled guilty to the offense and received 12 months of probation, had his license suspended\nfor 12 months, and was required to attend 12 weeks of counseling. \nThe 12 weeks of counseling were recommended following Applicant\u2019s referral to the\nrecognized counseling program. AC DC 22.e. applies due to the LCSW\u2019s evaluation of Applicant\nin July 2003. Based on her clinical interview and testing, she determined he was an alcohol abuser\nin need of counseling. The evaluation meets the elements of AC DC 22.e. \nApplicant began treatment in July 2003 and successfully completed the program in February\n2004. In that period, he participated in 12 weeks of group sessions, and two months of aftercare.\nThroughout the treatment and aftercare, he attended 22 AA meetings. Applicant\u2019s treatment has\nhelped him to drink alcohol responsibly. AC MC 23.b. (the individual acknowledges his or her\nalcoholism or issues of alcohol abuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem,\nand has established a pattern of abstinence (if alcohol dependent) or responsible use (if an alcohol\nabuser)) applies. \nWhile the March 2005 arrest described in subparagraph 1.d. is also viewed as an alcohol-\nrelated incident within the scope of AC DC 22.a., there are certain factors about the arrest that are\nextenuating. First, Applicant believed a designated driver was operating the car at the time of the\nstop. Second, Applicant\u2019s recount of his arrest by the police officer appears to support his opinion\nthat the officer overreacted to the situation, particularly after hearing the profane language. Since\nthere is no evidence that any blood tests were taken at the arrest location to determine whether\nApplicant was intoxicated, it is difficult to comprehend how the arresting officer could have\ninterpreted Applicant\u2019s query about why he was being arrested as constituting behavior supporting\na resisting arrest without violence charge and a disorderly conduct charge. Although there is no\nevidence as to why the arresting officer decided not to file charging papers, it probably is based on\nhis conclusion that there was an inadequate foundation for the charges.\nApplicant\u2019s character evidence provides a positive picture of a 23-year person who has in the\nlast two years compiled a good record at work among his peers and supervisors. After his DUI in\nJanuary 2003, he exercised good judgment by taking to heart the objectives of the group sessions and\naftercare. Though he was involved in a second alcohol-related incident in March 2005, there was\nnothing in his behavior that warranted his arrest and charge. Finally, there have been no alcohol-\nrelated incidents or behavior since March 2005, and those charges were dismissed. \nApplicant\u2019s case in mitigation also meets the elements of AC MC 23.d. (the individual has\nsuccessfully completed outpatient counseling or rehabilitation along with aftercare, has\ndemonstrated a clear established pattern of modified consumption or abstinence in accordance with\ntreatment recommendations, such as participation in meetings of AA or a similar organization and\nhas received a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified medical professional or a licensed clinical\nsocial worker whose is a staff member of a recognized treatment program)  as Applicant completed\nevery component of the program, and was given a good prognosis. Considering the evidence as a\nwhole under the specific guidelines and the whole person model, I find for Applicant under\n\n6\nsubparagraphs 1.a., 1.b., 1.c., and 1.d. Applicant has satisfactorily established his excessive alcohol\nconsumption will not recur. \nFORMAL FINDINGS\nParagraph 1 (Alcohol Consumption, Guideline G):\nFOR THE APPLICANT.\nSubparagraph 1. a.\nFor the Applicant.\nSubparagraph 1.b.\nFor the Applicant.\nSubparagraph 1.c.\nFor the Applicant.\nSubparagraph 1.d.\nFor the Applicant.\nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.

He was born a dual national in 1972\nin Colombia to an American mother and a Colombian father.  Applicant voted in elections after\nbecoming a U.S. citizen.  Since then, he has formally renounced his Colombian citizenship and\nsurrendered his Colombian passport.  His mother and father, who still live in Colombia, have no\nconnection or association with the government of Colombia. They do not create a heightened risk\nof foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion.  Clearance is granted.\n\nPursuant to Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended\n1\nand modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (Jan. 2, 1992), as amended, modified and revised. (Directive).\nThe government submitted five items in support of its contentions.\n2\nThe government granted Applicant an extension of time to submit additional materials.\n3\nItem 2 (Applicant\u2019s sworn answer, dated February 5, 2007).\n4\n3\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a\nsecurity clearance for Applicant.  On January 16, 2007, DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons1\n(SOR) detailing the basis for its decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline C (Foreign\nPreference) and Guideline B (Foreign Influence) of the revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) issued\non December 29, 2005, and implemented by the Department of Defense effective  September1, 2006.\nThe revised guidelines were provided to Applicant when the SOR was issued. The SOR detailed\nreasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it\nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant\nand recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a clearance should be\ngranted, continued, denied, or revoked.\nIn a sworn statement, dated February 4, 2007, Applicant responded to the SOR, and elected\nto have his case decided on the written record, in lieu of a hearing. Department Counsel submitted\nthe government\u2019s File of Relevant Material (FORM) dated May 23, 2007.  Applicant received the\n2\nFORM on May 29, 2007, and was given an opportunity to file objections and submit materials in\nrefutation, extenuation, or mitigation. Applicant submitted a written response on July 12, 2007.   The\n3\ncase was assigned to me on September 10, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant admitted all of the allegations under Guideline B. He also admitted allegations\nunder Guideline C with the exception of 1.e.  After a thorough  review of the pleadings and exhibits,\nI make the following findings of fact:\nApplicant is a 35-year-old strategic planner for a defense contractor.  He was born in\nColombia to an American mother and a Colombian father, thus acquiring his American citizenship.\nHe studied in a British school where he received his International Baccalaureate Diploma in\nColombia. After graduation, Applicant studied in Colombia receiving his undergraduate and\ngraduate degree from the Universidad in the area of architecture and urban planning. After receiving\nhis degrees, he worked in the academic arena in Colombia. The university has no political or\nreligious affiliation. In fact, the university was founded by his family and relatives to help low-\nincome students gain a higher education and benefit from educators who were trained in the U.S. \nApplicant was a professor, dean and administrator of the university. 4\n\nApplicant Exhibit C (Certificate, dated May 2006).\n5\nApplicant\u2019s Response to FORM, dated July 12, 2007.\n6\nItem 2, supra at note 2.\n7\nId.\n8\nItem 4 (Security Clearance Application, dated January 26, 2005).\n9\n4\nWhen Applicant worked in Colombia for the university from 1996 until 2004, he was not\ninvolved in defense work. He was a professor of art and architecture. He resigned from his position\nin 2002 and moved to the U.S. to become a research fellow, performing research on global poverty.\nAs a leader in the professional community (Member of American Institute of Architects), he trains\nprofessionals to make changes in a global economy. He has worked in several U.S. government\nprojects to determine strategies to improve the use of citizen tax money. He recently completed an\nadvanced degree in a well-known American university, receiving an honorary award.5\nApplicant is married and has two children. His wife is a Colombian citizen, who is in the\nprocess of applying for U.S. citizenship, resides in the U.S. with her husband. She is a legal\npermanent resident of the U.S. Applicant\u2019s two children are U.S. citizens. Applicant and his wife\nmoved to the United States in 2002. When Applicant moved to the U.S. with his wife and two sons,\nthey bought a house.6\nApplicant\u2019s father is a citizen and resident of Colombia. His mother is an American who\nresides in Colombia. They are both academics. Applicant\u2019s brothers and sisters live and work in the\nUnited States.  His brother works for a satellite connection provider and is Director of Government\nRelationships. His sister is a professor and does research work on cancer and related fields. His other\nbrother is a director in an accounting team for a federal agency.7\nApplicant\u2019s uncle was a senator in Colombia from 1999 until 2003. He served his four-year\nterm but is no longer a senator. During that time, Applicant helped his uncle reach the Colombian\nsenate by proposing funds for marketing strategies and budget allocations. He stressed that this help\nwas more of an occasional brainstorming activity and not a decision making position. Applicant also\nwas listed as a third alternate candidate for a position to the House of Representatives in 1998. He\nwas not elected. Since then, he has not participated in politics.8\nApplicant exercised his Colombian citizenship by voting in the Presidential elections in 2006.\nHe voted because he believes in democracy and that election was the first time in the country\u2019s\ndemocratic history that a president\u2019s reelection was possible. He did not know that it would have any\nimpact on a security clearance. He admits that every four years he voted in major Colombian\nelections.\nOn January 26, 2005, Applicant completed a security clearance application.  During a\n9\nSeptember 14, 2006 interview with a Department of Defense investigator, Applicant stated he was\nwilling to renounce his dual citizenship. When he became aware that his dual citizenship was an\nissue, Applicant surrendered his Colombian passport, and formally renounced his citizenship on July\n\nLetter dated July 6, 2007 from FSO to DOHA.\n10\nItem 6 (U.S. Department of State, Background Note: Columbia, March 2007); Item 5, U.S. Department of\n11\nState, Consular Information Sheet: Colombia, 16 August 2006, March 2007.\nDepartment of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).\n12\n5\n6, 2007, as verified by the Facility Security Officer.  By surrendering his passport, he surrenders his\n10\nability to vote in Colombian elections. As a dual citizen Applicant was obligated to use his\nColombian passport to enter Colombia.\nApplicant works as an associate in a large U.S. company involving clients such as\nDepartment of Homeland Security, Department of State, Center for Disease Control, and Nuclear\nRegulatory Commission. His work is related to large U.S. projects advising his clients of \nApplicant\u2019s work was essentially academic and not coerced or pressured by any group. He\nwas not in a position of a conflict of interest between the U.S. and Colombia.  He has never been\nlinked to any terrorist or illegal group. His work is linked to academic research that fosters\nknowledge, openness and creativity. The government conceded in its argument that Applicant would\nnot be subject to coercive foreign influence by the Colombian government.\nI take administrative notice of the following adjudicative facts from the U.S. Department of\nState reports submitted by the government.  Colombia is a developing country of 46 million people\n11\nin South America.  It has a free market economy with major commercial and investment ties to the\nUnited States. Colombia maintains an excellent extradition relationship with the United States. The\nUnited States has continued close cooperation with Columbia under the current administration.\nRecognizing that terrorism and the illicit narcotics trade in Colombia is inextricably linked, the U.S.\nCongress granted new, expanded statutory authorities in 2002 making U.S. assistance to Colombia\nmore flexible in order to better support the President\u2019s unified campaign against narcotics and\nterrorism. Colombia has a democratic government. Colombia and the U.S. enjoy friendly relations\nin economic, defense, and political matters. The U.S. State Department reports that, although serious\nproblems remained, the Colombian government\u2019s respect for human rights has improved in some\nareas. The threat of crime is significant in all parts of the country because of the activities of the\npolitical and drug-related terrorist groups in the country, but is somewhat less prevalent in most\nurban areas.  The presidential elections generally are free and fair.\nPOLICIES\n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d   As Commander in Chief, the President has\n12\n\u201cthe authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national security and to determine\nwhether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position . . . that will give that person\n\nId. at 527.\n13\nExec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960). \n14\nISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002).\n15\nId.; Directive, Enclosure 2, \u00b6 E2.2.2.\n16\nExec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7.\n17\n6\naccess to such information.\u201d   The President authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to\n13\ngrant applicants eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d  An applicant has the ultimate burden of\n14\ndemonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his or her\nsecurity clearance.  The clearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations\nshould err, if they must, on the side of denials.   Any reasonable doubt about whether an applicant\n15\nshould be allowed access to sensitive information must be resolved in favor of protecting such\nsensitive information.   The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily\n16\na determination as to the loyalty of an applicant.  It is merely an indication that the applicant has not\nmet the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a\nclearance.  \n17\nThe revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) set forth potentially disqualifying conditions (DC)\nand mitigating conditions (MC) under each guideline.  Additionally, each security clearance decision\nmust be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based on the relevant and material facts and\ncircumstances, the whole-person concept, along with the adjudicative process factors listed in \u00b6 6.3\nof the Directive, and AG \u00b6 2(a).\nConditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying, as well as those\nwhich would mitigate security concerns, are set forth and discussed in the conclusions section below.\nCONCLUSIONS\nI have carefully considered all the facts in evidence and the legal standards discussed above.\nI reach the following conclusions regarding the allegations in the SOR.\nGuideline C, Foreign Preference\nWhen an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a foreign country over\nthe United States, then he or she may be prone to provide information or make decisions that are\nharmful to the interests of the United States. This raises a security concern under the foreign\npreference guideline.\n\n7\nBased on all the evidence, Foreign Preference Disqualifying Condition (FP DC) 10(a)\nexercise of any right, privilege or obligation of foreign citizenship after becoming a U.S. citizen or\nthrough the foreign citizenship of a family member. This includes but is not limited to: (1) possession\nof a current foreign passport;. .  (6); seeking or holding political office in a foreign country; and (7)\nvoting in a foreign election), apply in this case.  Applicant voted in Colombian elections after\nbecoming a U.S. citizen. His name was on the ballot in 1998 for a house seat in 1998. Until recently,\nhe had a Colombian passport.\nI have considered all the Foreign Preference Mitigating Conditions (FP MC), and I especially\nconsidered FP MC 11(a) dual citizenship is based solely on parents\u2019 citizenship or birth in a foreign\ncountry, FP MC 11(b) the individual has expressed a willingness to renounce dual citizenship.  FP\nMC (e) the passport has been destroyed, surrendered to the cognizant security authority, or\notherwise invalidated. Applicant was a dual U.S. and Colombian citizen because his mother is\nAmerican and his father is Colombian.  Applicant  has not only expressed a willingness to renounce\ndual citizenship; he has formally surrendered his Colombian passport to the Facility Security Officer\non July 6, 2007. Since he has surrendered his passport, he will no longer be allowed to vote in\nelections, nor will he be able to run for office. Applicant was an alternate for a seat ten years ago.\nApplicant and his wife and sons now live in the U.S., and have a home here. Applicant\u2019s work is in\nthe U.S. Thus, a permanent behavioral change has occurred. Applicant\u2019s commitment is to his work\nand family in the U.S.\nApplicant has mitigated the security concerns under Guideline C, Foreign Preference. Thus,\nI find in favor of Applicant for those allegations.\nGuideline B, Foreign Influence\nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual has divided\nloyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or induced to help a foreign person,\ngroup, organization, or government in a way that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure\nor coercion by any foreign interest.  This raises a security concern under the foreign influence\nguideline.  Adjudication under this guideline can and should consider the identity of the foreign\ncountry in which the foreign contact or financial interest is located, including, but not limited to,\nsuch considerations as whether the foreign country is known to target United States citizens to obtain\nprotected information and/or is associated with a risk of terrorism.\nI considered Foreign Influence Disqualifying Condition (FI DC) 7(a) contact with a foreign\nfamily member, business or professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or\nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation,\ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; 7(b) connections to a foreign person, group,\ngovernment, or country that create a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation\nto protect sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person,\ngroup, or country by providing that information; . . . and 7(d) sharing living quarters with a person\nor persons, regardless of citizenship status, if the relationship creates a heightened risk of foreign\ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion). Applicant\u2019s mother and father live in Colombia.\nHis wife lives with him. Although the record does not reflect whether his wife has contact with\nfamily members in Colombia, commonsense dictates that if he has contacts with his parents, most\nlikely his wife has similar contacts. Thus, the government produced substantial evidence of these\nthree disqualifying conditions, and the burden shifted to Applicant to produce evidence and prove\n\n8\na mitigating condition. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the\ngovernment. \nI considered Foreign Influence Mitigating Conditions  (FI MC) 8(b) there is no conflict of\ninterest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of loyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group,\ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding\nrelationships and loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any conflict of\ninterest in favor of the U.S. interest, and (FI MC 8(a) nature of the relationships with foreign\npersons, the country in which these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those\npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely that the individual will be placed in a position of\nhaving to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, group, organization, or government\nand the interests of the U.S. Applicant\u2019s parents have no connections to the Colombian government.\nColumbia is a republic, with strong and cooperative ties with the U.S., especially in the area of\ncounter-narcotics. Colombia\u2019s government generally respected the human rights of its citizen\u2019s, with\nsome caveats that would also apply to many other friendly countries and allies. There is no evidence\nthat Colombia is known to target United States citizens to obtain protected information. While there\nremains the possibility of terrorist activity it is not linked to classified information. It is extremely\nunlikely that Applicant will ever be placed in a position of having to choose between the interests\nof his mother, father or uncle, or the government of Colombia and the interests of the United States.\nThe government has even conceded this point in its argument of the case.\nWhole Person Analysis\nThe adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make\nan affirmative determination that the person is an acceptable security risk.  Available, reliable\ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be considered in\nreaching a determination.  In evaluating Applicant\u2019s case, I have considered the adjudicative process\nfactors listed in the Directive and AG \u00b6 2(a).  \nSubstantial mitigating evidence weighs towards grant of Applicant\u2019s security clearance.\nApplicant is a mature person. He lives in the U.S. with his wife and two sons. There is no evidence\nhe has ever taken any action that could cause potential harm to the U.S. He takes his loyalty to the\nU.S. seriously, and works with U.S. agencies to develop strategies for democracy in the U.S.  The\nU.S. and other federal agencies have benefitted from his work. His ties to the U.S. are strong.\nSome circumstances weigh against Applicant in his whole person analysis. Colombia is a\nfriendly country with the U.S.; however, Colombia\u2019s government has to contend with the combined\nterrorist activities of left-wing guerillas, the rise of paramilitary self-defense forces in the 1990's and\nthe drug cartels. His father and mother still live in Colombia. They are a potential target of terrorists\nwho may attempt to pressure or coerce Applicant by threatening his relative living in Colombia.\nNevertheless, I conclude that the possibility that terrorists in Colombia would coerce him into\nproviding classified information, or he would provide classified information through affection for\nColombia is minuscule. \nApplicant\u2019s entire professional life has been devoted to the spread of knowledge and\ninformation to enhance global democracy. He exercised his universal democratic rights in his country\nas a dual citizen. He believes in democratic principles and has worked to increase those principles\nin Colombia. As soon as he learned that having his Colombian passport would hinder his ability to\n\n9\nsecure a clearance for his work in the U.S., he surrendered it to the proper authorities. Many\nmembers of his family are U.S. citizens. He has now established his life and work in the U.S. His\nwife is soon to become an American citizen and his two sons are U.S. citizens. Applicant\u2019s family\nhas no association with the government of Colombia. I find there is almost no potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation or duress. Applicant is an acceptable security risk. Considering all the\nevidence, I conclude Applicant has met his burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with\nthe national interest to grant him a security clearance.\n\u201cBecause of the extreme sensitivity of security matters, there is a strong presumption against\ngranting a security clearance. Whenever any doubt is raised . . . it is deemed best to err on the side\nof the government\u2019s compelling interest in security by denying or revoking [a] clearance.\u201d Dorfmont\nv. Brown, 913 F.2d 1399, 1401 (9  Cir. 1990). After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating\nth\nconditions, all the facts and circumstances, in the context of the whole person, I conclude he has\nmitigated the security concerns pertaining to foreign preference and foreign influence. The evidence\nleaves me without doubts as to Applicant\u2019s security clearance and suitability.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nThe following are my conclusions as to each allegation in the SOR:\nParagraph 1.  Guideline C:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a-g:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2.  Guideline B:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a-h:            \nFor Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.  Clearance is\ngranted.\nNoreen A. Lynch\n\n10\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Jeffreys, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\n\n2\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On January 16, 2007, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of\nthe basis for that decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline B (Foreign Influence) of\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant\nrequested a hearing.  On May 31, 2007, after the hearing, Administrative Judge Jacqueline T.\nWilliams granted Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Department Counsel filed a timely\nappeal pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nDepartment Counsel raised the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge erred in her\napplication of the Guideline B mitigating conditions; and whether the Judge\u2019s whole person analysis\nis arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  Finding error we reverse.\nWhether the Record Supports the Judge\u2019s Factual Findings\nA.  Facts\nThe Judge made the following pertinent findings of fact: Applicant was born in the People\u2019s\nRepublic of China (PRC), emigrated to the U.S. in 1982, and received an advanced degree from a\nU.S. university in 1988.  He became a U.S. citizen in 1996.  He is married and has two children, both\nof whom were born in the U.S.  His bank accounts and retirement account are in the U.S.\nApplicant\u2019s parents are citizens and residents of the PRC.  Both are in their 80s and retired.\nBoth are in poor health.  Applicant speaks to his parents \u201cabout once a week.\u201d  He and his brother\nsupplement their parents\u2019 income as needed.  They purchased an apartment in the PRC for his\nparents.  He has visited the PRC five times since 1999 to visit them.  Applicant\u2019s in-laws are citizens\nand residents of the PRC.  They are also residents of the U.S., and divide their time between the two\ncountries.  Applicant speaks to his in-laws about once a month.  \nThe PRC is a totalitarian regime \u201cwith foreign policy goals antithetical to the U.S.\u201d  It targets\nthe U.S. for intelligence purposes \u201cand operates against its own citizens in the U.S.\u201d  \nB.  Discussion\nThe Appeal Board\u2019s review of the Judge\u2019s findings of facts is limited to determining if they\nare supported by substantial evidence\u2013\u201csuch relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept\nas adequate to support such a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the record.\u201d\nDirective  \u00b6 E3.1.32.1.  \u201cThis is something less than the weight of the evidence, and the possibility\nof drawing two inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent an administrative\nagency\u2019s findings from being supported by substantial evidence.\u201d  Consolo v. Federal Maritime\nComm\u2019n, 383 U.S. 607, 620-21 (1966).  In evaluating the Judge\u2019s findings, we are required to give\ndeference to the Judge\u2019s credibility determinations.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1.  Department Counsel has\nnot explicitly challenged the Judge\u2019s findings of fact.  To the extent that challenges are implicit in\nthe allegations of error we will address them below.\nWhether the Record Supports the Judge\u2019s Ultimate Conclusions\n\nDirective \u00b6 E2.8(a), (b).\n1\n3\nA Judge is required to \u201cexamine the relevant data and articulate a satisfactory explanation\nfor\u201d the decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the facts found and the choices made.\u2019\u201d\nMotor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n of the United States v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43\n(1983)(quoting Burlington Truck Lines, Inc. v. United States, 371 U.S. 156, 168 (1962)).  The\ngeneral standard is that a clearance may be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests\nof national security.\u2019\u201d  Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  The Appeal\nBoard may reverse the Judge\u2019s decision to grant, deny, or revoke a security clearance if it is arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.  Directive  \u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.32.3 and E3.1.33.3.  \n\u201c[T]here is a strong presumption against granting a security clearance.\u201d   Dorfmont v. Brown,\n913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9  Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991).  Once the government\nth\npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the applicant to establish any\nappropriate mitigating conditions.  See Directive  \u00b6  E3.1.15.  \u201cThe application of disqualifying and\nmitigating conditions and whole person factors does not turn simply on a finding that one or more\nof them apply to the particular facts of a case.  Rather, their application requires the exercise of\nsound discretion in light of the record evidence as a whole.\u201d  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 05-03635 at\n3 (App. Bd. Dec. 20, 2006).  \nIn deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are arbitrary or capricious, the Board\nwill review the Judge's decision to determine whether:  it does not examine relevant evidence; it fails\nto articulate a satisfactory explanation for its conclusions, including a rational connection between\nthe facts found and the choice made; it does not consider relevant factors; it reflects a clear error of\njudgment; it fails to consider an important aspect of the case; it offers an explanation for the decision\nthat runs contrary to the record evidence; or it is so implausible that it cannot be ascribed to a mere\ndifference of opinion.  In deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are contrary to law,\nthe Board will consider whether they are contrary to provisions of Executive Order 10865, the\nDirective, or other applicable federal law.  See ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Jun. 2,\n2006).\nDepartment Counsel has challenged the Judge\u2019s favorable application of two Foreign\nInfluence Mitigating Conditions (FIMC), 8(a) and (b).   FIMC 8(a) is as follows:\n1\n[T]he nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which these\npersons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in that country are\nsuch that it is unlikely the individual  will be placed in a position of having to choose\nbetween the interests of a foreign individual, group, organization, or government and\nthe interests of the U.S.\nDepartment Counsel contends that the Judge failed to analyze Applicant\u2019s case in light of the\nnature of the PRC and in light of Applicant\u2019s family\u2019s having been targeted in the past by the PRC\ngovernment.  The Board finds merit in this argument.  In her Conclusions section, the Judge does\nnot relate her own findings about the totalitarian nature of the PRC and its intelligence gathering\nefforts against the U.S. to the issue of whether it is likely that Applicant could be placed in a position\nto choose between the interests of the PRC and of the United States.  More telling, the Judge does\nnot address Applicant\u2019s testimony concerning PRC hostility to his family.  This testimony establishes\n\n4\nthat, when Applicant was a child, PRC officials entered his family home in an attempt to find \u201canti\nrevolutionary evidence.\u201d Tr. at 27.  The testimony is compelling and underscores the fact that, at\nleast in the past, Applicant\u2019s family had been persecuted by the government.  Insofar as this\nmitigating condition focuses upon the \u201cposition or activities\u201d of foreign relatives or associates,\nApplicant\u2019s testimony heightens concern that his parents and in-laws could come to the attention of\nthe PRC government and thereby become a means whereby he is forced to choose between the\ninterests of the PRC and of the U.S.  The Judge\u2019s conclusion that neither Applicant\u2019s parents nor his\nin-laws \u201care likely to be vulnerable to foreign exploitation\u201d has no rational basis in the record\nevidence.  Decision at 6.  Indeed, the statement by the Judge is conclusory, without any explanation\nor elaboration in support.  Neither is it sustainable in the face of record evidence of Applicant\u2019s close\nfamily ties; the history of the PRC\u2019s hostility to Applicant\u2019s family; the PRC\u2019s history of human\nrights violations; and its hostility to the interests of the U.S.  The Judge\u2019s favorable application of\nFIMC8(a) is error.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 05-03279 at 4-5 (App. Bd. Sep. 20, 2007).   \nTurning to FIMC 8(b), this mitigating condition reads as follows: \n[T]here is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of loyalty or\nobligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country is so minimal, or the\nindividual has such deep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in the U.S., that\nthe individual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S.\ninterest.\nUnder the facts of this case, the crucial issue posed by this mitigating condition is whether\nApplicant has such deep and longstanding ties to the U.S. that he would not act against this country\u2019s\ninterests should the occasion arise.  The Board takes note of Applicant\u2019s testimony to the effect that\nhe has little sympathy for the government of the PRC.  Furthermore, common sense might suggest\nthat a person who has lived voluntarily in the U.S. for a considerable period of time is dedicated to\nthis country.  However, in evaluating this mitigating condition, the Board believes that it is crucial\nto balance the ties at stake and to consider record evidence that detracts from the notion that\nApplicant\u2019s ties to the United States are paramount.  Without impugning Applicant\u2019s patriotism, it\nis nevertheless necessary to consider the fact that Applicant is close to his parents, communicates\nwith them weekly and provides for them economically as the need arises, demonstrating loyalty and\nresponsibility for their well-being.  His frequent communication with his in-laws indicates that he\nis close to them as well.  These relatives live in a nation that views the U.S. as a primary intelligence\ntarget, that abuses human rights, and that has in the past targeted Applicant\u2019s parents for persecution.\nTherefore, as noted above, the record raises a serious question as to whether Applicant\u2019s parents\ncould come to the attention of the PRC and thereby become a means through which he would be\nfaced with a conflict between their interests and those of this country.  The Board has repeatedly held\nthat when the foreign power in question is hostile to the U.S. and its citizens, Applicant is faced with\na \u201cvery heavy burden\u201d to demonstrate that neither he nor his foreign family members are subject to\ninfluence by the foreign power.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 03-09053 at 5 (App. Bd. Mar. 29, 2006.)\nGiven the record in this case, we conclude that the Judge\u2019s analysis of the mitigating conditions is\nerror. \nWe have considered the Judge\u2019s whole person analysis.  To a large extent it summarizes the\ndiscussion which came before it.  The Judge states that Applicant has strong ties to the U.S. and\nconcludes that he \u201ccan be trusted to resolve any conflict of interest . . . in favor of the U.S.\u201d  Decision\n\n5\nat 7.  For the reasons set forth above, we conclude that this analysis fails to take into account\nsignificant aspects of the case, including the position of Applicant\u2019s parents in the PRC and his\ndevotion to them.  Admittedly, Applicant has testified that he would not act against the U.S. if faced\nwith the choice.  However, an Applicant\u2019s stated intention as to what he would do in the future is\nof relatively little weight, given the record in this case.  See ISCR Case No. 03-09053 at (App. Bd.\nMar. 29, 2006) (\u201cAn applicant\u2019s stated intention about what he or she might do in the future under\nsome hypothetical set of circumstances is merely a statement of intention that is not entitle to much\nweight, unless there is record evidence that the applicant has acted in a similar manner in the past\nunder similar circumstances.\u201d) After considering the Judge\u2019s decision, the briefs, and the record\nevidence, we conclude that the Judge has committed harmful error and that the record does not\nsupport a favorable decision.\nOrder\nThe Judge\u2019s favorable security clearance decision is REVERSED.\n  \nSigned: Jeffery D.

He became a naturalized U.S. citizen in April 2002. Foreign\nInfluence concerns raised by the Taiwanese citizenship of his fianc\u00e9e, grandparents, and other\nextended family members, are mitigated by his significant ties to the U.S. Applicant did not disclose\non his August 2005 security clearance application (e-QIP) that he had held a valid Taiwanese\npassport that expired in September 2000, but Personal Conduct concerns are not established because\nhe thought it had expired more than seven years before he applied for his clearance. Clearance is\ngranted.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a\nsecurity clearance for Applicant. As required by Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, \u00b6 E3.1.2\n(Jan. 2, 1992), as amended, DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) on February 9, 2007,\ndetailing the basis for its decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline B (Foreign Influence)\nand Guideline E (Personal Conduct) of the revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) issued on\nDecember 29, 2005,  and implemented by the Department of Defense effective September 1, 2006.\nThe revised guidelines were provided to Applicant when the SOR was issued. Applicant answered\nthe SOR on February 21, 2007, and elected to have a hearing before an administrative judge.\nThe case was assigned to me on May 14, 2007, and I convened a hearing on June 20, 2007,\nto consider whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security\nclearance for Applicant. Two government exhibits (Ex. 1-2) and eight Applicant exhibits (Ex. A-H)\nwere admitted, and testimony was taken from Applicant and four witnesses on his behalf. A\ntranscript (Tr.) of the hearing was received on July 2, 2007.\nRULINGS ON PROCEDURE\nOn May 4, 2007, the government requested the assigned administrative judge take\nadministrative notice of several proposed facts concerning Taiwan and the People\u2019s Republic of\nChina (PRC or China).  Authority to consider the government\u2019s request is set forth in \u00b6 E3.1.10 of\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6 (The Administrative Judge may rule on questions of\nprocedure, discovery, and evidence and shall conduct all proceedings in a fair, timely, and orderly\nmanner.). On May 24, 2007, I ordered Applicant to file any objections and/or propose alternative\nfacts for administrative notice by June 8, 2007. Applicant filed no response by the due date, but\nconfirmed at his hearing that he had no objection to my taking administrative notice. Before the\nintroduction of any evidence at the hearing, I allowed the government, with no objection from\n\nSee Background Note: Taiwan, dated October 2006 (I), Background Note: China, dated January 2007 (VIII),\n2\nChina: Country Reports on Human Rights Practices-2006, dated March 6, 2007 (IX), and Consular Information Sheet\non China, dated March 19, 2007 (XII).\nSee Taiwan: Recent Developments and U.S. Policy Choices, dated October 9, 2006 (II).\n3\nSee Intelligence Threat Handbook, excerpts, dated June 2004 (III). The document was prepared for the\n4\nInteragency OPSEC Support Staff by the Center for Counterintelligence and Security Studies, a private contractor.\nSee Annual Report to Congress on Foreign Economic Collection and Industrial Espionage, 2000 (VII) and\n5\nAnnual Report to Congress on Foreign Economic Collection and Industrial Espionage, 2005 (XI). \nSee U.S. National Security and Military/Commercial Concerns with the People\u2019s Republic of China,\n6\ndeclassified version dated January 3, 1999 (X).\nThe press releases (IV) and (V) were presented apparently to substantiate that Taiwan actively pursues\n7\ncollection of U.S. economic and propriety information. Neither case involves Applicant personally. The April 18, 2006,\npress release (IV) concerns the sentencing of a U.S. citizen for conspiring to commit trade secret theft between December\n1999 and December 2001 to the benefit of a corporation based in Taiwan. There is no evidence of that Taiwan\u2019s\ngovernment was involved in, or sanctioned the criminal activity. The January 22, 2007 (V) press release concerns the\nsentencing of a former U.S. State Department official for, in part, making false statements to the government concerning\nhis relationship with a female Taiwanese intelligence officer and by not reporting that he had traveled to Taiwan where\nhe met with the foreign intelligence officer. \nSee U.S. District Court Eastern District of Virginia, Statement of Facts, dated December 12, 2005 (VI). The\n8\ncourt records do not pertain to any criminal charge against Applicant.\n3\nApplicant, to amend its request for administrative notice to indicate that Taiwan has \u201csignificant\neconomic ties to China\u201d in lieu of Taiwan \u201cretains close ties to China.\u201d\nThe DOHA Appeal Board has ruled that administrative or official notice in administrative\nproceedings is broader than judicial notice under the Federal Rules of Evidence. In ISCR Case No.\n02-24875 (decided Oct. 12, 2006), the Appeal Board found no error by a DOHA administrative\njudge who took  administrative notice of a U.S. State Department Country Report, as the document\nwas an official U.S. government report relevant to the issues in the case before him, and it was\nprovided in advance to the applicant who had an opportunity to rebut its contents or to present\nalternative information for the judge to notice.\nApplicant filed no objection to the proposed facts for administrative notice, but this does not\nrelieve me of the responsibility to determine whether the proposed facts are proper for administrative\nnotice, i.e., easily verifiable by an authorized source and relevant and material to the case before me.\nFor source documentation the government relied on publications of the Department of State;  the\n2\nCongressional Research Service;  the Centre for Counterintelligence and Security Studies;  the\n3\n4\nNational Counterintelligence Center, now known as the Office of the National Counterintelligence\nExecutive;  a Select Committee of the United States House of Representatives;  two press releases\n5\n6\nreportedly from the U.S. Department of Justice;  and records of the U.S. District Court for the\n7\nEastern District of Virginia.8\n\nThe criminal wrongdoing of other U.S. citizens is of questionable relevance to an assessment of Applicant\u2019s\n9\nsecurity suitability. The only matter of arguably some relevance is that involving the U.S. State Department official where\na Taiwanese intelligence official was implicated, but there is no indication that Applicant has ever been targeted.\nConcerning the Taiwanese company\u2019s attempt to acquire sensitive commercial information for competitive advantage\n(IV), there is no indication of any government sponsorship, approval, or involvement. The company is viewed as a\ncriminal actor similar to individuals who choose to violate the law. \n4\nAfter weighing the reliability of the source documentation and assessing the relevancy and\nmateriality of the facts proposed by the parties, I took administrative notice of certain facts as set\nforth below.9\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nDOHA alleged under Guideline B that Applicant\u2019s fianc\u00e9e was a resident citizen of Taiwan\nseeking lawful admission to the U.S. (\u00b6 1.a), that his grandparents and other extended family\nmembers were resident citizens of Taiwan (\u00b6 1.b), that Applicant traveled to Taiwan in 2002, 2003,\nand 2004 (\u00b6 1.c), and that Applicant met his fianc\u00e9e in Japan in 2006 instead of in Taiwan because\nhe is subject to compulsory military service in Taiwan (\u00b6 1.d). Under Guideline E, Applicant was\nalleged to have falsified material facts on his August 2005 security clearance application (e-QIP)\nwhen he denied that he had held a Taiwanese passport in the last seven years (\u00b6 2.a). \nIn his Answer, Applicant admitted the Taiwanese residency and citizenship of his fianc\u00e9e and\nfamily members, as well as his trips to Taiwan and Japan on his U.S. passport. He averred that when\nhe applied to renounce his Taiwanese citizenship, he learned that he could be detained in Taiwan to\nfulfill his military service obligation, even if he entered with his U.S. passport. Not wanting to risk\nthe possibility of being held in Taiwan for 16 months, Applicant elected to meet his fianc\u00e9e in Japan\nrather than in Taiwan. Applicant denied deliberate falsification of his e-QIP, explaining that he\nbelieved his passport had been expired for more than seven years. Uncertain of the location of the\npassport or its expiration date when he first filled out his e-QIP, Applicant thought it had expired a\nlong time ago and he was advised by a company security official to answer the inquiry to the best\nof his knowledge.\nAfter a thorough review of the pleadings, exhibits, and transcript, and having agreed to take\nadministrative notice, I make the following findings of fact:\nApplicant\u2019s Background and Foreign Ties\nApplicant was born in Taiwan in October 1979. His father sold dried seafood. In June 1995,\nApplicant immigrated to the U.S. with his parents and siblings, two brothers born in 1990 and 1994\nand a sister born in 1978. Their U.S. immigration was sponsored by his father\u2019s eldest sister who had\nmarried a U.S. serviceman. Applicant entered the U.S. on a Taiwanese passport issued to him on\nSeptember 22, 1994. The passport was valid until September 22, 2000.\nApplicant entered ninth grade in the local public school knowing little to no English but with\nan aptitude for mathematics. With the support of a math teacher, he learned English through reading\nmath texts and other similar subjects of interest to him. In 1996, he began working at a local\n\nThis initial security clearance application was not available for my review. There is no evidence that it was\n10\never forwarded to the government.\n5\nsupermarket part-time to earn money, initially as a bagger. After he graduated in June 2000, he went\non to college, transferring after his freshman year to the state\u2019s polytechnic university. Applicant\ncontinued to work at the store stocking shelves during the summers and holidays while pursuing his\nbachelor\u2019s degree.\nIn April 2002, Applicant took the oath of U.S. naturalization, vowing to renounce all foreign\nallegiances, to support and defend the U.S. Constitution and its laws, and to bear arms or perform\nnoncombatant service or civilian service on behalf of the U.S. if required. Applicant considered\nhimself to be a citizen solely of the U.S. because he had renounced all allegiances to any foreign\nentity, including Taiwan. He made no effort to determine the effect of his acquisition of U.S.\ncitizenship on his Taiwanese citizenship. On April 29, 2002, he was issued his U.S. passport that is\nscheduled to expire on April 28, 2012. Applicant traveled to Taiwan on his U.S. passport from June\n14, 2002 to July 9, 2002, from January 1, 2003 to January 13, 2003, from January 1, 2004 to January\n14, 2004, and from May 28, 2004 to June 23, 2004.\nFrom December 2003 to May 2005, Applicant worked as a graduate teaching assistant in the\nuniversity\u2019s mathematics department. In about May 2005, Applicant was awarded his master of\nscience degree in applied mathematics. Applicant started working for his current employer as a\nsystems engineer II in July 2005. Before his first day on the job, Applicant was given a security\nclearance application to complete at home. Not sure if he had dual citizenship with Taiwan and the\nU.S. or of the date his Taiwanese passport expired, Applicant did not answer the questions of dual\ncitizenship or possession of a foreign passport within the last seven years. When asked by a company\nsecurity officer about his dual citizenship, Applicant responded that the U.S. considered him a U.S.\ncitizen, but that Taiwan could still consider him a citizen of Taiwan. As for his Taiwanese passport,\nApplicant indicated that he did not know of its location. Although he believed the passport had\nexpired a long time ago, he told her he did not know whether it was seven years in the past. She\nadvised him to answer \u201cNo\u201d to dual citizenship, and to respond on the passport issue to the best of\nhis knowledge and belief. Applicant answered \u201cNo\u201d to whether he had a foreign passport within the\nlast seven years.10\nAfter he submitted his clearance application to his employer, Applicant contacted U.S.\nimmigration and was advised that he was considered a dual citizen by the U.S. Applicant went to the\nTaipei Economic and Cultural Office (TECO) to formally renounce his Taiwanese citizenship. He\nwas told to return with his Taiwanese passport or apply for a new one. Believing that acquiring a new\nTaiwanese passport would raise security concerns, Applicant searched for his passport. On July 27,\n2005, the day after he found his Taiwanese passport, he applied to renounce his Taiwanese\ncitizenship, and surrendered his expired Taiwanese passport to a TECO official. Applicant did not\nmake a copy of the Taiwanese passport or note the date of its expiration.\nIn mid-August 2005, Applicant was asked at work to submit another security clearance\napplication in a new format. Applicant listed his dual citizenship with Taiwan and the U.S. and his\nforeign travel to Taiwan, but responded \u201cNo\u201d to question 17 d. \u201cIn the last 7 years, have you had an\nactive passport that was issued by a foreign government?\u201d on an Electronic Questionnaires for\nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP) signed by him on August 16, 2005. Applicant believed his foreign\n\n6\npassport had expired more than seven years ago. Applicant was granted an interim secret clearance\nfor his duties on an air defense radar program in December 2005.\nIn late 2005/early 2006, Applicant\u2019s Taiwanese passport was stamped expired and returned\nto him with his application to renounce citizenship. His application was denied because he  had not\nfulfilled his compulsory military service obligation in Taiwan. Since he turned 16 the year he\nemigrated from Taiwan, he was not eligible for an exemption from the military service requirement,\nand could be detained if he went to Taiwan, even on his U.S. passport, for up to 16 months until he\ncomplied with his military service obligation.\nOn February 23, 2006, Applicant was interviewed by an authorized investigator for the\nDepartment of Defense. Applicant informed the investigator that he had held a Taiwanese passport\nthat had expired, and that he had tried unsuccessfully to renounce his Taiwanese citizenship.\nIn about September 2005, Applicant started corresponding with a Taiwanese national whom\nhis mother had met while she was in Taiwan. After a year of telephone contact, Applicant met this\nfemale for the first time in Japan in September 2006. Applicant paid for her to travel from Taiwan\nto Japan as he did not want to risk being detained in Taiwan for military service and potentially\njeopardize his U.S. citizenship. Applicant and this female friend joined a travel group and spent five\ndays together in Japan, from September 28 to October 2, 2006.\nFollowing that trip, they decided to get married. She quit her job as a factory worker for an\nelectronics company in Taiwan in October 2006 so she could take English lessons. Applicant gave\nher some money intended to pay for the English classes, although it was a gift so she could do with\nit what she pleased. In December 2006, Applicant went to Japan a second time to see his fianc\u00e9e and\nmeet some members of her family. Applicant again paid for her travel to Japan, but did not cover\nthe expenses of family members who accompanied her (her older sister and sister\u2019s husband, her\nyounger sister, and a cousin). They all joined a travel group and spent five days together before her\nrelatives returned to Taiwan. Applicant and his fianc\u00e9e spent five more days together in Tokyo.\nApplicant completed a I-129F petition for U.S. immigration of his fianc\u00e9e, which was received by\nU.S. immigration on December 21, 2006.\nApplicant informed the facility security officer (FSO) at work about his engagement to the\nTaiwanese citizen, and he was briefed as to additional concerns of foreign influence his engagement\ncreated. In January 2007, DOHA furnished foreign influence interrogatories to Applicant, asking him\nto provide certified copies of his most recent Taiwanese and U.S. passports, and to update his foreign\ntravel, if any. In his response, Applicant denied that he had taken any action to renew his Taiwanese\npassport and any intent to renew it. He reported his travel to Japan to meet with his fianc\u00e9e and,\nduring the trip in December 2006, also some of her relatives. Applicant explained that he could not\nrisk a trip to Taiwan because of the military service issue, and that he understood his responsibilities\nto report to his security office any attempt by a foreign government to use threats against his family\nor fianc\u00e9e\u2019s family to obtain information. Applicant furnished DOHA with copies of his passports\nas of January 18, 2007, the application for a fianc\u00e9e visa, his fianc\u00e9e\u2019s biographical information, and\na letter confirming that he had shredded his Taiwanese passport in the presence of his FSO on\nJanuary 25, 2007.\n\n7\nApplicant\u2019s interim secret clearance was withdrawn in about November 2006, and he was\nremoved from the program where he had been working because it was classified. In his two years\non the job, Applicant had met his employer\u2019s expectations and had proven to be an extremely\ndedicated worker, spending long hours and weekends to ensure flight test success, and diligent in\nfollowing security procedures. Although it was a challenge to find unclassified work for Applicant\nto perform in the environment in which he operated, a team leader felt it was worth it to find\nunclassified duties for Applicant. A flight test lead gave Applicant \u201cas good a review as [he] can\nwrite.\u201d\nApplicant\u2019s application for a fianc\u00e9e visa was granted and she joined Applicant in the U.S.\nin mid-April 2007. Applicant informed his fianc\u00e9e he cannot travel to Taiwan as long as he is subject\nto conscription into Taiwan\u2019s military. As of June 2007, they had not married but were planning a\ncivil ceremony for early July, as her visa is only valid for 90 days. She has agreed to renounce her\nTaiwanese citizenship and to acquire U.S. citizenship as soon as she is eligible.\n All of Applicant\u2019s financial assets are in the U.S.  He has four bank accounts, as well as\nretirement fund and stock accounts valued at about $40,000 total.\nApplicant\u2019s parents and siblings are naturalized U.S. citizens who have not formally\nrenounced their Taiwanese citizenship. His father is on the kitchen staff at a local university and\nworks at a restaurant at night. His mother does not work outside the home. Applicant\u2019s brothers are\nstill minors who live at home with his parents. Applicant\u2019s sister is attending a university in the U.S.\nApplicant\u2019s maternal grandmother and his paternal grandparents are resident citizens of Taiwan. His\nmaternal grandfather died about a year ago. Applicant does not have a close personal relationship\nwith his mother\u2019s family. He stayed with his paternal grandparents on three of his four trips to\nTaiwan. His paternal grandparents sold sewing machines before they retired. Applicant telephones\nthem two to three times per year (birthday and Chinese New Year). Applicant stayed with a friend\nfrom elementary school on his trip to Taiwan in 2003. Applicant\u2019s contacts with this friend are\nlimited to electronic mail two or three times a year. To Applicant\u2019s knowledge, this friend works in\na bank. Applicant has a paternal uncle who is a professor of biochemistry at a private university in\nTaiwan. Applicant does not have any ongoing contact with this uncle whose sons are both U.S.\nresident citizens.\nApplicant\u2019s fianc\u00e9e\u2019s parents and siblings are resident citizens of Taiwan. Her parents are\nfarmers. The elder of her sisters is a part-time seamstress married to a manager of a leather factory.\nThe younger sister works in a department store. On Applicant\u2019s advice, his fianc\u00e9e has told her\nfamily members that he is an engineer but not that his duties are defense-related. Applicant\u2019s fianc\u00e9e\ncalls her parents about once a week, which is down from the five times weekly when she first\narrived.\nI take administrative notice of the following adjudicative facts. The government of Taiwan\nis a multi-party democracy. The United States recognizes that there is only one China, that the\ngovernment of the PRC is the sole legal government of China, and that Taiwan is part of China.\nNonetheless, under the Taiwan Relations Act of 1979, the U.S. conducts unofficial relations with\nTaiwan. Although the U.S. terminated its Mutual Defense Treaty, it has continued to sell appropriate\nmilitary defensive material to Taiwan. The PRC has surpassed the U.S. as Taiwan\u2019s most important\ntrading partner, but Taiwan maintains a large military establishment whose primary mission is the\n\n8\ndefense of Taiwan against the PRC, which is seen as the predominant threat and has not renounced\nthe use of force against Taiwan. It is U.S. policy that the resolution of disputes between Taiwan and\nChina be peaceful. Taiwan is a major international trading power and a member of the World Trade\nOrganization. It enjoys normal trade relations with the U.S., and ready access to U.S. markets. The\nU.S. State Department reports that Taiwan has taken dramatic steps to improve respect for human\nrights and create a democratic political system since ending martial law. In the past, organizations\nin Taiwan employed unlawful methods to obtain U.S. economic and intelligence information.\nPOLICIES\n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S.\n518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has \u201cthe authority to . . . control access to\ninformation bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently\ntrustworthy to occupy a position . . . that will give that person access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527.\nThe President authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants eligibility for\naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb.\n20, 1960). An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with\nthe national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App.\nBd. Dec. 19, 2002).\nThe revised Adjudicative Guidelines set forth potentially disqualifying conditions (DC) and\nmitigating conditions (MC) under each guideline. In evaluating the security worthiness of an\napplicant, the administrative judge must also assess the adjudicative process factors listed in \u00b6 6.3\nof the Directive. The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a\ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant. See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. It is merely an indication\nthe applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have\nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nCONCLUSIONS\nGuideline B\u2014Foreign Influence\nUnder Guideline B, Foreign Influence, foreign contacts and interests may be a security\nconcern if the individual has divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or\ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way that is not in U.S.\ninterests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Adjudication under this\nGuideline can and should consider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact\nor financial interest is located, including, but not limited to, such considerations as to whether the\nforeign country is known to target United States citizens to obtain protected information and/or is\nassociated with a risk of terrorism. (AG \u00b6 6). \nApplicant is engaged to wed a Taiwanese citizen who has been in the U.S. since April 2007\non a 90-day fianc\u00e9e visa. Applicant\u2019s paternal grandparents are resident citizens of Taiwan, and\nApplicant stayed with them when he went to Taiwan in 2002 and twice in 2004. Under AG \u00b6 7(a),\n\nConcerns of a heightened risk of improper influence from the PRC were  not alleged in the SOR but argued\n11\nin the request for administrative notice.  There is no evidence Applicant has ever traveled to the PRC, or that he intends\nto do so. Despite the increasing economic ties between the PRC and Taiwan, the PRC is not likely to be permitted to\noperate with impunity in Taiwan. Taiwan\u2019s own national security remains under constant threat from the PRC. Assuming\nthe PRC is engaged in active intelligence gathering against Taiwan within Taiwan\u2019s borders, Applicant\u2019s and his\n9\nforeign influence concerns are raised by contact with a foreign family member, business or\nprofessional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a foreign country\nif that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure\nor coercion. DC \u00b6 7(a) applies because of the close bonds Applicant shares with his fianc\u00e9e and\ngrandparents, all Taiwanese citizens, which place him at a heightened risk of being manipulated or\nimproperly influenced. Disqualifying condition \u00b6 7(d), sharing living quarters with a person or\npersons, regardless of citizenship status, if that relationship creates a heightened risk of foreign\ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion, also applies. While the risk is lessened somewhat\nby her move to the U.S., his fianc\u00e9e has been in the U.S. only a few months, is unfamiliar with the\nculture, and knows little of the English language. Understandably, she remains close to her family\nin Taiwan and likely relies on them for emotional support. She contacted them about five times a\nweek when she first arrived, although the frequency of her contact with them is now once weekly.\nThe government also alleged Applicant\u2019s travels to Taiwan and to Japan to meet his fianc\u00e9e\nto avoid possible military conscription in Taiwan raised security concerns. Absent any evidence that\nApplicant engaged in conduct while traveling abroad that could make him vulnerable to exploitation,\npressure or coercion (see DC 7(i)), his travel is not disqualifying in itself but is relevant to assessing\nthe strength of his ties to his grandparents and fianc\u00e9e.\n \nThe personal bonds between Applicant and his fianc\u00e9e certainly, but also between Applicant\nand his paternal grandparents, are too strong to satisfy the first prong of mitigating condition \u00b6 8(a),\nthe nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which these persons are located,\nor the positions or activities of those persons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual\nwill be placed in a position of having to choose between the interest of a foreign individual, group,\norganization, or government and the interests of the U.S.  Although Applicant\u2019s contact with his\npaternal grandparents is limited to two or three times yearly on birthdays and Chinese New Year, it\nis not casual. He testified that if he were to go to Taiwan, he would make an effort to visit them, and\nto meet his fianc\u00e9e\u2019s parents. (Tr. 97)\nThe risk of Applicant being placed in a position where he would have to choose between\nthem and the U.S. is diminished somewhat by the fact that Taiwan does not have a hostile\nrelationship with the U.S., and is not known to sponsor terrorism. Taiwan has a defense pact with\nthe U.S., and has made considerable progress in achieving democratic elections, civil liberties, and\nstable, viable governmental institutions. Almost all restrictions on the press have ended, restrictions\non personal freedoms have been relaxed, and the prohibition against organizing new political parties\nhas been lifted. While the U.S. does not support independence for Taiwan and is committed to a one-\nChina policy, under the Taiwan Relations Act, the U.S. is obligated to help Taiwan defend itself,\nincluding making available defensive arms and defensive services to Taiwan. Although the PRC is\nTaiwan\u2019s largest trading power, U.S. commercial ties with Taiwan have been maintained and\nexpanded since 1979, and Taiwan is not likely to jeopardize its relationship with the U.S. by overly\npressuring its citizens.11\n\nfianc\u00e9e\u2019s family members are not in positions where they are likely to be targeted by the PRC. \n10\nHowever, even nations with a history of friendly relations do not always have the same\ninterests. Yet, there is nothing about the positions or activities of Applicant\u2019s fianc\u00e9e, of her family\nmembers in Taiwan, or of Applicant\u2019s grandparents that would implicate military, intelligence, or\nsecurity interests and increase the likelihood of them being targeted. Applicant\u2019s fianc\u00e9e is no longer\nwithin the physical reach of Taiwanese authorities. When she was in Taiwan, she worked on an\nassembly line in a privately-owned electronics factory. Her parents are farmers. One sister works\npart-time as a seamstress, the other as a department store manager. Before their retirements,\nApplicant\u2019s grandparents sold sewing machines. The only relative  with a position of some visibility\nin Taiwan is a paternal uncle who is a professor of biochemistry at a private university in Taiwan,\nbut Applicant has no ongoing contact with this uncle.\nIn the event Applicant was to find himself in a position of having to choose between the\ninterests of these foreign family members and the interests of the U.S., several factors lead me to\nconclude that Applicant can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. (\u00b6\n8(b), there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of loyalty or obligation to\nthe foreign person, group, government, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and\nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve\nany conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest). Applicant has lived continuously in the U.S. and\nbeen exposed to cultural and peer influences in the U.S. since he was 15. He testified credibly to a\npersonal sense of gratitude for his college education in the U.S., financed in part by grants. When\nhe acquired his U.S. citizenship, he thought of himself solely as a U.S. citizen, and consistent with\nthat citizenship, traveled on his U.S. passport to Taiwan. He made no effort to renew his Taiwanese\npassport. After he learned that the U.S. considered him a dual citizen, he attempted to renounce his\nTaiwanese citizenship. Told that he could be detained when in Taiwan for up to 16 months to\ncomplete compulsory military service, he arranged to meet his fianc\u00e9e in Japan and intends to not\nreturn to Taiwan as long as he is subject to this service obligation. Applicant held an interim secret\nclearance until about November 2006, pending final adjudication of his clearance, and he proved\ntrustworthy and reliable in following all security procedures. Sensitive to his obligation to protect\nU.S. interests, Applicant apprised his employer of his engagement to a Taiwanese citizen, and he has\nbeen briefed several times as to the potential risks of foreign influence. He understands and is willing\nto comply with his reporting requirement (see \u00b6 8(e), the individual has promptly complied with\nexisting agency requirements regarding the reporting of contacts, requests, or threats from persons,\ngroups, or organizations from a foreign country).\nGuideline E\u2014Personal Conduct\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to\ncomply with rules and regulations can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability,\ntrustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. Of special interest is any failure to\nprovide truthful and candid answers during the security clearance process or any other failure to\ncooperate with the security clearance process. (AG \u00b6 15) Applicant did not disclose on his August\n2005 e-QIP that he had held a valid Taiwanese passport until September 2000. He testified to a belief\nthat it had expired more than seven years before he completed his clearance application. The\nevidence shows that Applicant, who had not used that foreign passport since he entered the U.S. at\nage 15, was unaware of the location of his Taiwanese passport when he was asked to complete his\n\n11\nfirst security clearance application in July 2005. Before he filled out the e-QIP of record in August\n2005, he located his passport and gave it to the TECO with his application to renounce citizenship\non July 27, 2005. He had done what he thought was consistent with his U.S. citizenship, and did not\nrealize that he would need a copy. Given the date of the passport\u2019s expiration had been an issue when\nhe filled out his initial security clearance application, it is more difficult to understand why he would\nnot have noted the expiration date, to check whether he had filled out his clearance application\ncorrectly if nothing else, before he surrendered his passport to TECO. Yet, he also did not know as\nof July 27, 2005, that he would have to submit another security clearance application. Given he\ncorrected his answer regarding his dual citizenship and revealed his travels to Taiwan (all on his U.S.\npassport) when he completed his August 2005 e-QIP, he would have had little to gain by failing to\ndisclose that he had held a Taiwanese passport expired since September 2000. Under the\ncircumstances, his denial of any intentional falsification is accepted as credible. Accordingly, none\nof the disqualifying conditions are pertinent.\nWhole Person Analysis\nThe adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make\nan affirmative determination that the person is eligible for a security clearance. (AG \u00b6 2(a).)\nAlthough the risk of undue foreign influence cannot be completely ruled out because of his close\nrelationships with citizens of Taiwan (\u00b6 2(a)(1), the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct),\nApplicant has shown that he can be counted on to fulfill his fiduciary obligations to the U.S. He was\ntrusted by his employer with access to a classified program and did not disappoint. He has been\nforthright about his foreign ties with his employer, and as a consequence, is aware of his reporting\nobligations should any foreign person, entity, or organization exert any pressure because of, or\nthrough, these foreign connections. Given his reputation for honesty and his dedication, attested to\nby a former mentor who has known him since he came to the U.S. at age 15, and by coworkers\nfamiliar with his work over the past two years, Applicant is not likely to do anything to jeopardize\nU.S. interests.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nThe following are my conclusions as to each allegation in the SOR:\nParagraph 1. Guideline B:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nFor  Applicant\nParagraph 2. Guideline E:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nFor Applicant\nDECISION\n\n12\nIn light of all of the circumstances in this case, it is clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. Clearance is granted.\nElizabeth M. Matchinski\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Findings of Fact In his Answer to the SOR, dated October 1, 2007, Applicant admitted the factual allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, and 1.c, and \u00b6\u00b6 2.d of the SOR. He denied the factual allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 2.a, 2.b, and 2.c of the SOR. He also provided additional information to support his request for eligibility for a public trust position. Applicant is 37 years old, married with four children born in the United States, and has worked for the same defense contractor for the past 15 years. Applicant came to the United States in 1989 at the age of 18, and has spent the last 19 years here. During that time he obtained an Associate\u2019s Degree from college, been gainfully employed continuously, married an U.S. citizen, and purchased a home, a four-unit apartment house, and 25 acres of farm land. Applicant has no property or economic interests in Jordan. (Tr. 19-24, 33, 45, 48; Exhibits 1, A, F, G) Applicant was born in Jordan, as were his four brothers. His parents lived there until 2003, when they moved to the United States to be near Applicant. They rent an apartment in the same town in which Applicant lives. Applicant\u2019s parents intend to become U.S. citizens, and will submit their application in October 2008, when they are eligible to do so. Applicant has three living brothers.

On July 16, 2007, the Defense Office\nof Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the\ntrustworthiness concerns under Guidelines C and B for Applicant. The action was taken\nunder Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry\n(February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense\nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as\namended (Directive); Department of Defense (DoD) Regulation 5200.2-R, Personnel\nSecurity Program, dated Jan. 1987, as amended (Regulation), and the revised\nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and\neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on August 6, 2007, and submitted a\nrevised Answer on October 1, 2007.  He requested a hearing before an Administrative\nJudge. Department Counsel was prepared to proceed on November 19, 2007, and I\nreceived the case assignment on November 27, 2007. A Notice of Hearing was issued\nthe same day, setting the hearing for December 12, 2007.  Applicant retained an\nMarch 27, 2008\n\n2\nattorney, who sought a continuance.  I granted Applicant\u2019s continuance until not later\nthan February 28, 2008, in order for his counsel to be available.  DOHA issued a\nsecond Notice of Hearing on January 25, 2008, setting the hearing for February 12,\n2008, at a particular location.  The location had to be changed, and an Amended Notice\nof Hearing was issued January 31, 2008, setting the hearing again for February 12,\n2008.  I convened the hearing as scheduled on that day.  \nThe government offered Exhibits (Ex.) 1 through 4, which were received without\nobjection.  Applicant testified and submitted Exhibits A through G, without objection. I\ngranted Applicant\u2019s request to keep the record open until February 26, 2008, to submit\nadditional matters.  On that date, he submitted Exhibits H through M, without objection.\nThe record closed that day. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on\nFebruary 22, 2008. Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and\ntestimony, eligibility for access to sensitive information is granted.\nProcedural and Evidentiary Rulings\nRequest for Administrative Notice\nDepartment Counsel submitted a formal request that I take administrative notice\nof certain facts relating to Jordan and the Palestine Territories. (Tr. at 15, 16.) The\nrequest and the attached documents were admitted into evidence and were included in\nthe record as Hearing Exhibit 4. The facts administratively noticed are set out in the\nFindings of Fact, below. \nFindings of Fact\nIn his Answer to the SOR, dated October 1, 2007, Applicant admitted the factual\nallegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, and 1.c, and \u00b6\u00b6 2.d of the SOR. He denied the factual\nallegations in \u00b6\u00b6 2.a, 2.b, and 2.c of the SOR. He also provided additional information\nto support his request for eligibility for a public trust position.  \nApplicant is 37 years old, married with four children born in the United States,\nand has worked for the same defense contractor for the past 15 years.  Applicant came\nto the United States in 1989 at the age of 18, and has spent the last 19 years here.\nDuring that time he obtained an Associate\u2019s Degree from college, been gainfully\nemployed continuously, married an U.S. citizen, and purchased a home, a four-unit\napartment house, and 25 acres of farm land. Applicant has no property or economic\ninterests in Jordan. (Tr. 19-24, 33, 45, 48; Exhibits 1, A, F, G)\nApplicant was born in Jordan, as were his four brothers.  His parents lived there\nuntil 2003, when they moved to the United States to be near Applicant.  They rent an\napartment in the same town in which Applicant lives. Applicant\u2019s parents intend to\nbecome U.S. citizens, and will submit their application in October 2008, when they are\neligible to do so. Applicant has three living brothers.  One lives in the United States,\nnear Applicant, in his own apartment.  The two other brothers live in Sweden, having\nimmigrated there in 2007.  One of these brothers used to work for the Palestinian\n\n3\nAuthority in an economic development position.  He no longer works for that\norganization.  One other brother died in 1999 in an auto accident in India.  Applicant\ntraveled to Jordan in 1999 for the funeral. Applicant has a cousin in the United States,\nwho is a U.S. citizen. (Tr. 34-36, 42, 43, 52-57; Exhibits 1, 3, I-M)\nApplicant had a Jordanian passport, issued on October 13, 1998, and expiring\non October 12, 2003.  He has not renewed that passport.  On February 22, 2008,\nApplicant surrendered that passport to his employer, who shredded it and disposed of\nthe residue.  Applicant did not intend to renew that passport, though he made contrary\nstatements in interrogatories because he thought his loyalty to the United States was in\nquestion.  At that time, he made a flippant response.  Applicant is willing to renounce\nhis Jordanian dual citizenship.  Applicant has a U.S. passport, issued in January 2002,\nand expiring in January 2012. (Tr. 32, 40, 57; Exhibit 2)\nApplicant traveled to Jordan in 2000, on a family vacation.  He has not returned\nto Jordan since then, and does not intend to do so in the future.  His family now lives in\nthe United States and Sweden, and it is too expensive to take his immediate family to\nJordan. Applicant has no contact with any uncles, aunts, or cousins who may still be\nliving in the Middle East. (Tr. 39, 56, 57, 66)\nApplicant\u2019s supervisors evaluate him as a valued employee whose performance\nexceeds expectations constantly.  They consider him as exercising sound judgment in\nhis positions with his employer as he has been promoted over the term of his\nemployment.  They trust his work performance.  Applicant takes courses constantly in\ninformation technology to improve his knowledge and capabilities in his employment.\n(Tr. 28, 29; Exhibits B - G) \nI take administrative notice of the following facts.  Jordan is a Middle Eastern\ncountry with a constitutional monarchy and a developing economy.  It has a pro-western\nforeign policy and has had close relations with the United States for over four decades.\nJordan\u2019s human rights practices have some problems, including prolonged detention,\ndenial of due process, and some restrictions of freedom of speech, press, assembly,\nand other human rights.  Jordan does aggressively pursue terrorists, and cooperates\nwith the United States in fighting international terrorism.  I also take administrative\nnotice of the Palestinian Authority as the legitimate representative of the Palestinian\npeople who live in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank area of the former British League\nof Nations and United Nations mandate area known as Palestine at the eastern end of\nthe Mediterranean Sea.  There are two main political parties within the Palestinian\nterritory, Fatah and Hamas.  Fatah is a secular political party and the largest party of\nthe two.  Hamas combines Palestinian nationalism with Islamic fundamentalism, and\nwages an intermittant terrorist campaign to undermine the Palestinian peace process.\n(Exhibit 4)\nPolicies\nPositions designated as ADP I and ADP II are classified as \u201csensitive positions.\u201d\n(See Regulation \u00b6\u00b6 C3.1.2.1.1.7 and C3.1.2.1.2.3.)  \u201cThe standard that must be met for\n\n4\n. . . assignment to sensitive duties is that, based on all available information, the\nperson\u2019s loyalty, reliability, and trustworthiness are such that . . . assigning the person to\nsensitive duties is clearly consistent with the interests of national security.\u201d (See\nRegulation \u00b6 C6.1.1.1.) The Deputy Under Secretary of Defense (Counterintelligence\nand Security) Memorandum, dated November 19, 2004, indicates trustworthiness\nadjudications will apply to cases forwarded to DOHA by the Defense Security Service\nand Office of Personnel Management.  Department of Defense contractor personnel\nare afforded the right to the procedures contained in the Directive before any final\nunfavorable access determination may be made. (See Regulation \u00b6 C8.2.1.)  \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a public trust position, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the\nAG. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\n[sensitive] information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based\non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable\ntrustworthiness decision. \nA person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to sensitive information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard sensitive information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nsensitive information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order (EO) 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin\nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty\n\n5\nof the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple\nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline C, Foreign Preference\nThe trustworthiness concern related to the guideline for Foreign Preference is set\nforth in AG \u00b6 9, \u201cWhen an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a\nforeign country over the United States, then he or she may be prone to provide\ninformation or make decisions that are harmful to the interests of the United States.\u201d\nAG \u00b6 10 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be\ndisqualifying.  The one disqualifying condition applicable in this case is:\n(a) exercise of any right, privilege or obligation of foreign citizenship after\nbecoming a U.S. citizen or through the foreign citizenship of a family\nmember.  This includes but is not limited to:\n(1) possession of a current foreign passport;\nApplicant had a Jordanian passport, and dual Jordanian - United States\ncitizenship.  He also has a U.S. passport.  The Jordanian passport expired in October\n2003, and was not renewed.\nAG \u00b6 11 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns.  There are\nthree mitigating conditions which are applicable here:\n(a) dual citizenship is based solely on parents' citizenship or birth in a\nforeign country;\n(b) the individual has expressed a willingness to renounce dual\ncitizenship;\n(e) the passport has been destroyed, surrendered to the cognizant\nsecurity authority, or otherwise invalidated.\nApplicant had a Jordanian passport, but It was destroyed in February 2008, by\nhis employer at his request.  Applicant does not intend to obtain another passport,\neither by renewal of the older passport, or by application for new passport.  His family\nno longer lives in Jordan or Palestine, and he does not desire to return to Jordan for\nany reason. His dual citizenship with Jordan was based on his parent\u2019s citizenship and\nhis birth there.  He expressed a willingness at the hearing three times to renounce his\nJordanian citizenship.  Applicant has lived in the United States longer than he lived in\nJordan.  His wife and children are U.S. citizens by birth.  He owns three parcels of real\nestate in the United States.  These three factors make his connection to the United\nStates exceedingly strong.  He has no connection to Jordan now other than his birth.\n\n6\nGuideline B, Foreign Influence\nThe trustworthiness concern relating to the guideline for Foreign Influence is set\nout in AG & 6:  \nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual has\ndivided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or induced to help a\nforeign person, group, organization, or government in a way that is not in U.S. interests,\nor is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Adjudication under this\nGuideline can and should consider the identity of the foreign country in which the\nforeign contact or financial interest is located, including, but not limited to, such\nconsiderations as whether the foreign country is known to target United States citizens\nto obtain protected information and/or is associated with a risk of terrorism.\nAG \u00b6 7 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be\ndisqualifying.  The one disqualifying condition applicable is:\n(a) contact with a foreign family member, business or professional associate,\nfriend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a foreign country if that contact\ncreates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or\ncoercion;\nApplicant\u2019s parents are resident aliens in the United States, as is one brother of\nhis.  The two remaining brothers are residents of Sweden since 2007.  He has frequent\ncontact with his parents who live in the same community he does.  He has frequent\ncontact with his one brother, who also lives in the same community.  His two brothers in\nSweden he has more limited contact with because of the distance from them.  All are\ncitizens of Jordan or Palestine.  One of his brothers in Sweden did work for the\nPalestinian Authority until moving to Sweden.  Applicant made two trips to Jordan, one\nin 1999 for his brother\u2019s funeral, and in 2000 with his wife and children on vacation to\nvisit his family.  \nAG \u00b6 8 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns.  The three\nmitigating conditions applicable are:\n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which\nthese persons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in that country\nare such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a position of having to choose\nbetween the interests of a foreign individual, group, organization, or government and\nthe interests of the U.S.;\n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual's sense of loyalty\nor obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country is so minimal, or the\nindividual has such deep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in the U.S., that\nthe individual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S.\ninterest;\n\n7\n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and infrequent\nthat there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign influence or exploitation.\nApplicant\u2019s immediate family members no longer reside in Jordan or Palestine,\nbut rather in the United States and Sweden.  They retain, for the time being, their\nJordanian or Palestinian citizenship until they can become citizens of the United States,\nor Sweden in the situation of his two brothers living there.  There is no conflict of\ninterest between Applicant, his job, and his family loyalties.  Applicant\u2019s loyalty to the\nUnited States is very strong because he has lived over half his life here, his family is\nhere, and his financial and emotional investments are in the United States alone.  He\nhas no loyalty to Jordan or Palestine.  Applicant will not be placed in a position of\nhaving to choose between the interests of the United States and any foreign group or\ngovernment.  Furthermore, his contact with his brothers in Sweden is infrequent, though\nnot casual because of the family relationship, but Sweden is not a threat to the United\nStates to involve exploitation or influence upon Applicant.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a public trust position by considering the totality of the\nApplicant\u2019s conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should\nconsider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature,\nextent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct,\nto include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct;\n(4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which\nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for\npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or\nrecurrence.\u201d Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility\nfor a public trust position must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon\ncareful consideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. The conduct involved here is his\nfamily\u2019s foreign birth status, former residence in Jordan and Palestine, and Applicant\u2019s\ntwo trips to Jordan in 1999 and 2000.  All those facts have changed in the past four\nyears.  Applicant has not traveled to Jordan for the past eight years, and does not\nintend to do so in the future because none of his immediate family live there anymore.\n(See AG & 2(a)(1).) Applicant was an adult, married with children, when the events\noccurred forming the basis of the SOR. (See AG & 2(a)(4).) He willingly retained his\nJordanian passport after it expired, but also obtained a U.S. passport after becoming a\nU.S. citizen.  Finally, in 2008, he destroyed the expired Jordanian passport. (See AG &\n2(a)(2).) His parents and siblings no longer residing in Jordan or Palestine, there is little\nlikelihood of pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress. (See AG & 2(a)(8).)  Between\n2003 and 2008, the events and factors alleged in the SOR have all changed because\nApplicant\u2019s family moved out of Jordan and Palestine, and he no longer has a\nJordanian passport.\n\n8\nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a public trust position. I conclude the foreign\npreference and foreign influence trustworthiness concerns for Applicant.  I conclude the\n\u201cwhole person\u201d concept for Applicant.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline C:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline B:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.d:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a public trust\nposition.

On August 30, 2006, the Under Secretary of Defense (Intelligence) published a\nmemorandum directing application of revised adjudicative guidelines (Guidelines) to all adjudications and other\ndeterminations made under the Directive in which the SOR was issued on or after September 1, 2006. \n  The government\u2019s motion was made pursuant to Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance \u00b6 E3.1.17, to\n2\nconform the allegations with her testimony.\n  ISCR Case No. 02-17219 at 4 (App. Bd. Jan. 7, 2005.)\n3\n2\nApplicant is a 27-year-old research assistant employed by a government contractor. She failed\nto mitigate the overall lack of judgment, reliability, and ability or willingness to comply with laws,\nrules, and regulations raised by her history of abusing controlled substances. Clearance is denied.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn December 28, 2006, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued\nApplicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging facts that raise security concerns under Guideline\nH (Drug Involvement). The SOR informed Applicant that, based on information available to the\ngovernment, DOHA adjudicators could not make a preliminary affirmative finding that it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant her access to classified information and recommended\nthat her case be submitted to an administrative judge for a security determination.  On January 17,\n1\n2007, Applicant answered the SOR (Answer), and requested a hearing. \nThe case was assigned to me on February 21, 2007. On March 21, 2007, I convened a hearing\nat which the government presented one exhibit, marked GE 1, to support the SOR. Applicant\ntestified on her own behalf, and presented no witnesses or exhibits. DOHA received the transcript\n(Tr.) on March 30, 2007.\nPROCEDURAL ISSUES\nThe government moved to amend  the second line of SOR \u00b6 1.a, by deleting \u201cJanuary 2006\u201d\n2\nand substituting therefore, \u201cFebruary 2007.\u201d I granted the government\u2019s motion without objection.\n(Tr. 67-69)\nApplicant objected to the phrase \u201cwith varying frequency\u201d in SOR \u00b6 1.a, and moved to amend\nthe allegation to read \u201cYou have used marijuana between zero and three times from approximately\nJune 1999 until the summer of February 2005. You have used it once in January 2006 and once in\nFebruary 2007.\u201d Department counsel objected, and I denied her motion. (Tr. 69-73) The allegation,\nas drafted, fairly encompassed the proposed language. It placed Applicant on ample notice of the\nallegations against her, and allowed her to present both a meaningful response to the SOR and a\nwell-prepared defense during the hearing.3\nFINDINGS OF FACT\n\n3\nApplicant admitted all SOR allegations with explanations. Her admissions to the SOR\nallegations are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After careful consideration of the evidence\nand Applicant\u2019s demeanor and testimony, I make the following additional findings of fact:\nApplicant is a 27-year-old research assistant. She is single and has no children. From 1998\nto 2002, she attended a prestigious university in the United States, receiving a bachelor of science\ndegree in Physics with and a minor in Political Science. While in college, she worked as an\nenvironmental activist raising funds for national parks, as a research assistant to professors, as a\nfederal contractor (from June to August 2001), and as a legal secretary. She also traveled extensively\nthroughout Europe. After college, she worked as a research assistant, traveled to Russia as a\ncounselor, traveled to the Middle East, worked as a bartender, and traveled to the Palestinian\nterritories (from August 2004 to October 2004). She has worked for a defense contractor since April\n2004 and needs access to classified information to keep her position.\nDuring the summer of 1999, Applicant left home to live with relatives and work as an\nenvironmental activist raising funds for national parks. Although 19 years old, this was her first time\noutside of parental supervision. Her co-workers and newly acquired friends were habitual drug users\nand she was introduced to the use of illegal drugs. During that summer, she tried marijuana for the\nfirst time. She used marijuana socially three to four times a week during the months of June, July,\nand August 1999. (Tr. 29-31) She and her friends would get together socially, and someone would\ncirculate a pipe full of marijuana or a marijuana cigarette around the room/group and she would\nsmoke the marijuana.\nDuring that same summer, Applicant experimented with LSD once, ecstasy twice, and\nhallucinogenic mushrooms (mushrooms) twice. She went to a concert with a friend. Her friend\noffered her LSD and she knowingly accepted the drug. She suffered hallucinations and visual shift\nof perception. She was concerned and scared after her experience with LSD. (Tr. 46) She has never\nbeen offered or used LSD since. (Tr. 31-32) She intends to never use LSD again. \nIn the summer of 1999, she used ecstasy twice, at a house party and during a camping trip.\nHer use of ecstasy was under circumstances similar to her use of marijuana. Someone in the social\ngroup would have a container with the ecstasy pills, and offer them to the group. She knowingly\ningested the ecstasy. She has not been offered or used ecstasy since the Summer of 1999. (Tr. 33-35)\nApplicant also knowingly attended a party designed specifically for people to use\nmushrooms, and she used the mushrooms. She hallucinated so strongly that she lost contact with\nreality and was extremely surprised to wake up the next morning alive and healthy. (Tr. 49)\nApplicant used mushrooms again in the Spring of 2000. A different group of friends planned a\ncamping trip specifically to use mushrooms. She knowingly attended the camping trip and used\nmushrooms. (Tr. 34-35, 54) She no longer has contact with any of the friends with whom she shared\nthe mushrooms. (Tr. 55)\nFrom June 2002 to February 2005, Applicant did not use drugs. Between February 2005 and\nDecember 2005, Applicant used marijuana four times. During that period of time, she was working\nin a middle-eastern country and took her vacations in a Bedouin village. She was offered marijuana\ncigarettes socially by the Bedouins, and she accepted their offers and smoked marijuana four times.\n\n  GE 1, question 24.\n4\n  Directive, E2.2.1. \u201c. . . The adjudicative process is the careful weighing of a number of variables known as\n5\nthe whole person concept. Available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable,\nshould be considered in reaching a determination. . . .\u201d The whole person concept includes the consideration of the nature\nand seriousness of the conduct and surrounding circumstances; the frequency and recency of the conduct; the age of the\n4\n(Tr. 36-38) She is still in contact with one of her friends that smoked marijuana with her in the\nBedouin village.\nApplicant used marijuana again in January 2006. Upon her return to the United States from\nthe middle-east, she moved in with a couple of friends from college who were habitual marijuana\nusers. She used marijuana one time. She testified, \u201cI had many opportunities before and after that\nsmoke, and I refused.\u201d (Tr. 40-41) Applicant estimated that since January 2006, she has been offered\nmarijuana approximately 10 times. Once at a bar, another time at a house party (in October 2006),\nand approximately eight times at her college friend\u2019s apartment. (Tr. 63) People were using\nmarijuana in her presence during those ten times. She still visits with one of her marijuana-smoking\nfriends who lives in the area.\nApplicant submitted her security clearance application in April 2004. She was forthright and\ncandid in her answers and disclosed all of her illegal drug use as alleged in the SOR and the\ncircumstances that led to such use. She stated that after her use of marijuana in January 2006, she\nno longer enjoyed it, and had not use marijuana since. She further stated: \u201cI don\u2019t plan on using any\nof these drugs again.\u201d  Moreover, in her January 17, 2007, response to the SOR she also stated: \u201cTo\n4\nbe very clear: I do not plan to use any of these drugs in the future.\u201d\nApplicant smoked marijuana again in February 2007. (Tr. 42-43) She explained that after her\nlease expired, she attended an open house looking for a place to live. The people hosting the open\nhouse passed a marijuana cigarette among their guests. She accepted the offer and smoked the\nmarijuana. There were other people at the open house, and this was the first time she had ever met\nthe hosts or any of the guests. (Tr. 45)\nSince her college years, Applicant has known that the use of marijuana, LSD, ecstasy, and\nmushrooms was illegal. She stated she became aware while filling out her security clearance\napplication that the government would be concerned about her past drug use. When asked why she\nused marijuana again in February 2007 if she was aware of the government\u2019s concerns, she replied:\n\u201cIt was a bad decision for which I have no ready excuse, Your Honor.\u201d (Tr. 66)\nPOLICIES\nThe Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines which must be considered in evaluating an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. Foremost are the disqualifying and\nmitigating conditions under each adjudicative guideline applicable to the facts and circumstances\nof the case. However, the guidelines are not viewed as inflexible ironclad rules of law. The presence\nor absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not determinative of a conclusion for or\nagainst an Applicant. Each decision must also reflect a fair and impartial common sense\nconsideration of the factors listed in Section 6.3 of the Directive, and the whole person concept.5\n\napplicant; the motivation of the applicant, and the extent to which the conduct was negligent, willful, voluntary, or\nundertaken with knowledge of the consequences involved; the absence or presence of rehabilitation; and the probability\nthat the circumstances or conduct will continue or recur in the future. \n  See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988).\n6\n  ISCR Case No. 98-0761 at 2 (App. Bd. Dec. 27, 1999) (Substantial evidence is more than a scintilla, but less\n7\nthan a preponderance of the evidence.); ISCR Case No. 02-12199 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 3, 2006) (Substantial evidence\nis such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the\ncontrary evidence in the record.); Directive, \u00b6 E3.1.32.1.\n  Egan, supra n.9, at 528, 531.\n8\n  Directive E2.2.2.\n9\n  Guidelines, \u00b6 24.\n10\n5\nHaving considered the record evidence as a whole, I conclude Guideline H (Drug Involvement) is\nthe applicable relevant adjudicative guideline.\nBURDEN OF PROOF\nThe purpose of a security clearance decision is to resolve whether it is clearly consistent with\nthe national interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified\ninformation.  The government has the initial burden of proving controverted facts alleged in the\n6\nSOR. To meet its burden, the government must establish a prima facie case by substantial evidence.7\nThe responsibility then shifts to the applicant to refute, extenuate or mitigate the government\u2019s case.\nBecause no one has a right to a security clearance, the applicant carries the burden of persuasion.8\nA person who has access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with\nthe government based on trust and confidence. The government, therefore, has a compelling interest\nto ensure each applicant possesses the requisite judgement, reliability and trustworthiness of one who\nwill protect the national interests as his or her own. The \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d\nstandard compels resolution of any reasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access to\nclassified information in favor of protecting national security.9\nCONCLUSIONS\nUnder Guideline H (Drug Involvement), use of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription\ndrug can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because it may\nimpair judgment and because it raises questions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply\nwith laws, rules, and regulations.  \n10\nApplicant\u2019s admissions to the SOR allegations and her testimony establish she experimented\nwith LSD (once), ecstasy (twice), and hallucinogenic mushrooms (twice) in 1999-2000. She used\nmarijuana approximately 40 times from June 1999 to June 2002. Most of her use of marijuana was\nduring the Summer of 1999 when she used marijuana three to four times a week. After that summer,\n\n6\nshe used marijuana three to four times a year until June 2002. Applicant did not use marijuana from\nJune 2002 to February 2005. From February 2005 to the day of the hearing, Applicant used\nmarijuana six times. The last two times she used marijuana were in January 2006, at age 26, and\nFebruary 2007, at age 27. Guideline H Disqualifying Condition (DC) 25(a): any drug abuse, and DC\n25(h): . . .failure to clearly and convincingly commit to discontinue drug use, apply.\nThere are four Drug Involvement Mitigating Conditions (DI MC) under Guidelines \u00b6 26(a)-\n(d): \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened under such\ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability,\ntrustworthiness, or good judgment;\n(b) a demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future, such as: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts;\n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; \n(3) an appropriate period of abstinence;\n(4) a signed statement of intent with automatic revocation of clearance for any\nviolation;\n(c) abuse of prescription drugs was after a severe or prolonged illness during which these\ndrugs were prescribed, and abuse has since ended;\n(d) satisfactory completion of a prescribed drug treatment program, including but not limited\nto rehabilitation and aftercare requirements, without recurrence of abuse, and a favorable\nprognosis by a duly qualified medical professional.\nI considered all Guideline H Mitigating Conditions (MC) and I conclude none apply.\nConsidering the totality of the circumstances of her case, I find Applicant\u2019s drug involvement to be\nrecent, not isolated, and as such, it cannot be attributed to youthful ignorance. She is a mature,\nintelligent, and a well-educated person who knew or should have known about the criminal\nconsequences of her behavior and the seriousness of her actions, but still chose to abuse controlled\nsubstances. \nWhile filling out her security clearance application, she was warned of the government\u2019s\nconcerns about her illegal drug use. In the security clearance application and in her answer to the\nSOR, she promised not to use drugs again. Notwithstanding, she used marijuana in February 2007.\nHer use of marijuana in 2007 is troubling considering she has been working for a federal contractor\nsince April 2006, and she answered the SOR (outlining the government\u2019s drug involvement\nconcerns) on January 17, 2007. Applicant demonstrated she lacked judgment by taking drugs from\ncomplete strangers on several occasions, placing herself at risk of criminal charges and risking her\nlife. Ultimately, her overall behavior demonstrates she lacks judgment and reliability, and places\nserious doubts in her ability to protect classified information. \nApplicant\u2019s has continued her association with drug-using friends and is not avoiding the\nenvironment where drugs are used. As such, her behavior precludes a finding that she has\ndemonstrated her intent not to use drugs in the future. (Guidelines \u00b6 26(b)) Her promises to abstain\nfrom illegal drugs in the future ring hallow in light of her past behavior and empty promises. I find\nGuideline H against the Applicant.\n\n7\nI have carefully weighed all evidence, and I applied the disqualifying and mitigating\nconditions as listed under the applicable adjudicative guidelines. I specifically considered\nApplicant\u2019s age, education, level of maturity, and her approximately three years working for a\ndefense contractor. As previously discussed, Applicant\u2019s overall past behavior forms a pattern of\ndisturbing drug use with significant adverse security implications. Applicant failed to present\nsufficient evidence to mitigate the overall lack of judgment, reliability, and ability or willingness to\ncomply with laws, rules, and regulations raised by her behavior.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal findings regarding each SOR allegation as required by Directive Section E3.1.25 are\nas follows:\nParagraph 1, Drug Involvement (Guideline H)\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.d\nAgainst Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. Clearance is denied.\nJuan J. Rivera\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Applicant\nrequested a hearing.  On October 29, 2007, after the hearing, Administrative Judge Matthew E.\nMalone denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant timely appealed pursuant to\nthe Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge erred in concluding\nApplicant\u2019s falsification of his security clearance application was deliberate; whether the Judge erred\nby concluding that the security concerns raised under Guideline E had not been mitigated.1\n(1) Applicant contends that he did not deliberately falsify his security clearance application\n(SF-86) by failing to disclose unfavorable information of security concern in response to four\ndifferent questions.  In support of this contention, he argues that when he was updating his SF-86,\nhe was advised by his facility security officer (FSO) to only correct specific information and sign the\nfinal page, and to not provide any additional adverse information.  As a result, Applicant believes\nhe is being made a \u201cscapegoat to others not doing their job.\u201d  Applicant\u2019s argument does not\ndemonstrate that the Judge erred.\nIn his findings of fact, the Judge noted that Applicant had \u201c. . . held security clearances up\nto and including TS/SCI continuously since 1989.\u201d   He then appropriately considered Applicant\u2019s\n2\nexplanation for why he failed to disclose the information in question in light of the record evidence\nas a whole.  Based on this assessment, the Judge reasonably concluded that Applicant\u2019s claims to\nhave relied on the guidance of his FSO were implausible: \u201cHaving extensive experience in the\nclearance process, Applicant knew or should have known he was responsible for his answers and\nstatements made to the government.  His assertion that an FSO knew of certain changes to be made\nin Applicant\u2019s questionnaire and directed those changes, but somehow limited Applicant from\nupdating possible adverse information, taken together with all of the evidence of his delinquent\ndebts, is simply untenable and strains credulity.\u201d   On this record, the Judge\u2019s findings of deliberate\n3\nfalsification are sustainable.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1; ISCR Case No. 04-03849 at 2-3 (App. Bd.\nJan. 26, 2006). \n(2) Applicant also contends that the Judge erred in concluding that the security concerns\nraised by his falsifications had not been mitigated, based upon the favorable record evidence,\nparticularly his lengthy military and civilian service, his many years of holding a security clearance\nwithout adverse incident, and his favorable life changes since 2003.

Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  The presence of some mitigating evidence\ndoes not alone compel the Judge to make a favorable security clearance decision.

An applicant\u2019s disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, or an ability to argue\nfor a different interpretation of the evidence, is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed the\nevidence or reached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.\nIn this case, the Judge weighed the mitigating evidence offered by Applicant against the\nrecency and seriousness of the disqualifying conduct, and considered the possible application of\nrelevant mitigating conditions and whole person factors.  The Judge found in favor of Applicant\nunder Guideline F.  However, the Judge reasonably explained why the evidence which Applicant had\npresented in mitigation was insufficient to overcome the government\u2019s other security concerns.  The\nBoard does not review a case de novo.  The favorable record evidence cited by Applicant is not\nsufficient to demonstrate the Judge\u2019s decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g.,\nISCR Case No. 02-28041 at 4 (App. Bd. Jun. 29, 2005).

Pending official\nrevision of the Directive, the Revised Adjudicative Guidelines supercede the guidelines listed in Enclosure 2 to the\nDirective, and they apply to all adjudications or trustworthiness determinations in which an SOR was issued on or after\nSeptember 1, 2006.\n Gx. 12 was admitted as demonstrative evidence related to the allegations in SOR \u00b6 1. Its sole purpose was to\n3\nassist me in understanding and organizing the information presented in support of the SOR.\n Tr., 35 - 61.\n4\n2\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nAfter reviewing the results of Applicant\u2019s most recent background investigation, adjudicators\nfor the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) were unable to make a preliminary\naffirmative finding  that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to give Applicant a security\n1\nclearance. On May 2, 2007, DOHA issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging facts\nthat raise security concerns addressed in the Revised Adjudicative Guidelines under Guideline F\n(financial considerations).2\nApplicant timely responded to the SOR and requested a hearing. The case was assigned to\nme on July 6, 2007, and I convened a hearing on September 6, 2007, at which the parties appeared\nas scheduled. I admitted 12 exhibits proffered by the government (Gx. 1- 12 ). Applicant testified\n3\nand offered five exhibits, which were admitted without objection as Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (Ax.) A -\nE.  I also left the record open to receive additional information from Applicant. On September 14,\n4\nDOHA received the transcript (Tr.). The record closed on September 16, 2007, when I received\nApplicant\u2019s post-hearing submission, which is included in the record as Ax. F.\nPROCEDURAL ISSUE\nOn June 29, 2007, Department Counsel submitted a Motion to Amend the SOR, whereby the\ngovernment sought to add new allegations under Guideline E (personal conduct). Specifically, the\nmotion proposed to add the following:\n\u201c2. Guideline E: Conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty,\nor unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions about an\nindividual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information.

After a\nthorough review of the pleadings, transcript, and exhibits, I make the following additional findings\nof fact.\nApplicant is 42 years old and works as an independently-employed computer systems security\nspecialist on a contract for work being performed by a large defense contractor. Applicant served in\nthe U.S. Air Force from 1989 until 1995, and was assigned as an information systems operator with\ntraining in information systems security. Between November 1995, when he left active duty, and\nMarch 2007, he worked for four different defense contractors in jobs related to information systems\nand computer security. He has held security clearances up to and including TS/SCI continuously\nsince 1989.\nApplicant has been married twice. He and his first wife were married in October 1988,\nseparated in February 2003, and divorced in February 2005. They had four children together,\nincluding twins (a boy and a girl) born in 1995. Applicant re-married in February 2005. Applicant\n\n Her most recent surgery occurred in August 2007, accounting, in part, for the delay in convening a hearing\n6\nin this matter.\n Ax. A.\n7\n Answer; Gx. 4; Tr., 66 - 67.\n8\n4\nsupports his current wife and her five-year-old son. She has been unable to work since late 2005 due\nto chronic pain from a chronic internal condition that has required several surgeries.6\nApplicant and his first wife filed a Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition on February 16, 1999. On\nJune 4, 1999, they were discharged of $154,836 in debts and other liabilities. (SOR \u00b61.a) Applicant\u2019s\nfinancial problems at that time stemmed from unexpected medical costs associated with the birth of\none of their twins, and the financial impacts from an unplanned but related change in Applicant\u2019s\nemployment. Although Applicant was still in the Air Force when the children were born, he and his\nwife were improperly charged for significant medical costs. Additionally, the child required\nextensive medical care for several years thereafter. Around the time these problems arose, Applicant\nalso had to decide whether to accept unaccompanied orders to an overseas duty station and leave his\nfamily at a difficult time. His only other option, which he eventually selected, was to leave the Air\nForce at the end of his enlistment. Although he found work right away, his gross annual income (e.g.,\n$39,300 in 1997; $42,900 in 1998 ) was not enough to keep up with the medical bills along with\n7\ntheir other routine expenses.\nWhen Applicant and his first wife separated in February 2003, he paid her $4,250 each month\nin spousal support, child support, and health care insurance. The divorce decree entered in February,\n2005, reduced his monthly obligation to $3,000, but he was later ordered to pay an additional $420\neach month for health insurance. Additionally, Applicant lived and worked in an area where the cost\nof living is relatively high, and had to rent a house sufficient for the child visitation he was awarded.8\nFrom 2003 through 2006, Applicant incurred several debts in the form of unpaid rent,\ndelinquent credit cards, and arrearages for the monthly support to his ex-wife. Between June 2004\nand June 2007, he paid $2,368 a month through a wage garnishment ordered to satisfy an arrearage\nin his child and spousal support obligations. (SOR \u00b6 1.b) This constituted nearly 50% of his monthly\npay. The arrearage was satisfied and Applicant\u2019s support obligations ended in July 2007, when his\nex-wife became a registered nurse and obtained full-time employment.\nApplicant also incurred the following delinquent debts:\nSOR \u00b6 1.c: $3,492 for a 2006 car repossession.\nSOR \u00b6 1.d: $265 for an unpaid medical bill placed for collection in February 2006.\nSOR \u00b6 1.e: $221 for an unpaid telephone bill placed for collection in February 2006.\nSOR \u00b6 1.f: $561 for an unpaid medical bill placed for collection in October 2005.\nSOR \u00b6 1.g: $50 for an unpaid medical bill placed for collection in October 2005.\nSOR \u00b6 1.h: $673 for an unpaid medical bill placed for collection in October 2005.\nSOR \u00b6 1.i: $536 for an unpaid credit card account charged off in April 2005.\nSOR \u00b6 1.j: $140 for a judgment entered in January 2005.\nSOR \u00b6 1.k: $2,125 for a judgment for unpaid rent entered in December 2004.\n\n Gx. 2.\n9\n Id.\n10\n Gx. 1.\n11\n Gx. 3.\n12\n Gx. 2.\n13\n Id.\n14\n5\nSOR \u00b6 1.l: $148 for a bad check placed for collection in December 2004.\nSOR \u00b6 1.m: $57 for an unpaid cash advance loan placed for collection in April 2004.\nSOR \u00b6 1.n: $11,305 for an unpaid personal loan charged off in March 2004.\nSOR \u00b6 1.o: $82 for an unpaid medical bill placed for collection in January 2003.\nApplicant has paid or otherwise resolved the debts listed at SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e and 1.j. In March\n2007, he began repaying the debt listed in SOR \u00b6 1.n. He made an initial payment of $200 and is\npaying $50 each month on the debt. \nAfter leaving the Air Force, Applicant worked for several defense contractors as a regular\nsalaried employee. His highest gross annual income was between $75,000 and $87,500 during his\nemployment with a large defense contractor between June 2002 and March 2007. Thereafter, he\nbegan working as an independent contractor through a personnel placement firm that found him\nassignments on contracts held by companies such as those by whom he was once employed. In\nMarch 2007, his gross annual pay increased to about $128,000. On the Monday following his\nhearing, Applicant was due to start a new independent job paying about $187,200. From his gross\npay, he must cover his own benefits, such as life insurance and health coverage.\nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (SF 86) on October 11, 2003.  On April\n9\n21, 2004, Applicant made pen-and-ink changes to the SF 86, and affixed a dated signature at the end\nof the form and on the appended \u201cAuthorization for Release of Information.\u201d On July 6, 2004, he\nagain reviewed the form, this time writing \u201cAll information has been reviewed and are (sic) certified\nas correct.\u201d  On March 21, 2007, he signed and submitted another SF 86 which bore a pre-printed\n10\ndate of October 2, 2003.  Prior to October 2003, Applicant\u2019s last known application for clearance\n11\nwas made through a personnel security questionnaire (DD Form 398) submitted on March 9, 1994.12\nIn response to question 20 (\u201cCredit History\u201d) of the 1994 application, Applicant disclosed\na 1990 car repossession, but stated that the car was returned to him after he repaid the deficiency on\nthe loan. In his response to question 33 (\u201cYour Financial Record - Bankruptcy\u201d) of his October 2003\nSF 86, Applicant disclosed his 1999 bankruptcy. In response to question 35 (\u201cYour Financial Record\n- Repossessions\u201d) of the same SF 86, he disclosed a 1998 car repossession.  When he updated the\n13\nOctober 2003 SF 86 in April 2004 and in July 2004, he corrected information about his residences,\nhis employment history, his personal references, his relatives, and his marital status. He also added\na zip code to the repossession creditor\u2019s address.  He added no new information about any\n14\ndelinquent debts or judgments.\n\n Tr., 125 - 129.\n15\n Gx. 2.\n16\n Gx. 1.\n17\n Tr., 62, 92 - 96, 132 - 142.\n18\n Ax.

Since March 2007, he has realized about $10,000\nin net income each month after taxes. From that, after paying for his own health care and insurance,\nas well as rent, car expenses, utilities, and so forth, available information shows he would have had\nat least $3,000 remaining each month but for the monthly support payments.15\nApplicant\u2019s March 2007 SF 86 contains largely the same information as his October 2003\nSF 86. The 2007 SF 86 shows additional pen-and-ink updates to his employment history and one of\nhis personal references. It also reflects a change in his history of residences, in that, whereas in\nOctober 2003  he had listed an address where he was living when he incurred a delinquent debt and\n16\ncivil judgment for unpaid rent in December 2004. That address was missing from his March 2007\nSF 86.17\nAt hearing, Applicant testified he submitted the 2007 SF 86 in response to a request by the\ncompany for whom he was working before he started work as an independent contractor. He also\ntestified he did not update his financial information in his 2004 or 2007 updates because the\nFacilities Security Officer (FSO) at work told him to update only information pertaining to\nresidences, job history, personal references, and so on. Applicant asserts he took their guidance to\nmean he should not disclose any new adverse information.18\nApplicant has amassed an impressive work record, both in the military and as a civilian. He\npresented numerous awards and commendations, both formal and informal, from his civilian\nemployers. He also presented several performance evaluations from his military service reflective\nof a highly qualified and reliable junior enlisted member.19\nPOLICIES AND BURDEN OF PROOF\nEach security clearance decision must be a fair, impartial, and commonsense determination\nbased on examination of all available relevant and material information, and consideration of the\npertinent criteria and adjudication policy in the Revised Adjudicative Guidelines.  Decisions must\n20\nalso reflect consideration of the factors listed in the \u00b6 2(a) of the new guidelines.  The presence or\n21\n\nmotivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of\ncontinuation or recurrence.\n See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988).\n22\n See Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, 531.\n23\n See Egan; Revised Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 2(b).\n24\n Revised Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 18.\n25\n7\nabsence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not determinative of a conclusion for or against\nan applicant. However, specific applicable guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be\nmeasured against them as they represent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to\nclassified information. In this case, the pleadings and the information presented by the parties at\nhearing require that Revised Adjudicative Guideline E (personal conduct) and Guideline F (financial\nconsiderations) be applied.\nA security clearance decision is intended to resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest  for an applicant to either receive or continue to have access to classified\n22\ninformation. The government bears the initial burden of producing admissible information on which\nit based the preliminary decision to deny or revoke a security clearance for an applicant.\nAdditionally, the government must be able to prove controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If the\ngovernment meets its burden, it then falls to the applicant to refute, extenuate or mitigate the\ngovernment\u2019s case. Because no one has a \u201cright\u201d to a security clearance, an applicant bears a heavy\nburden of persuasion.  A person who has access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\n23\nrelationship with the government based on trust and confidence. The government, therefore, has a\ncompelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgement, reliability and\ntrustworthiness of one who will protect the national interests as his or her own. The \u201cclearly\nconsistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any reasonable doubt about an\napplicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the government.24\nCONCLUSIONS\nFinancial Consideration. Under Guideline F, \u201c[f]ailure or inability to live within one\u2019s\nmeans, satisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment,\nor unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an\nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information. An individual\nwho is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.\u201d  The\n25\ngovernment presented sufficient information, consisting of two credit reports (Gx. 9 and 10),\nApplicant\u2019s response to DOHA interrogatories (Gx. 4), and records pertaining to a garnishment of\nApplicant\u2019s pay (Gx. 6) and two civil judgments against him (Gx. 7 and 8) to support the allegations\nin SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a - 1.o. Additionally, Applicant admitted all of the SOR allegations except SOR \u00b6 1.j.\nAvailable information shows Applicant received a discharge of debts through bankruptcy in 1999\n(SOR \u00b6 1.a), satisfied a child and spousal support arrearage through wage garnishment between 2004\nand 2007 (SOR \u00b6 1.b) and accumulated at least $19,000 in other delinquent debts and civil\n\n \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations;\u201d \n26\n \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts;\u201d\n27\n \u201cthe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is\n28\nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;\u201d\n \u201cthe conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person's control (e.g. loss of\n29\nemployment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual\nacted responsibly under the circumstances;\u201d\n Revised Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 15.\n30\n8\njudgments (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c - 1.o) between 2003 and 2006, most of which remains unpaid to date. The\nforegoing requires consideration of Guideline F disqualifying conditions 19(a)  and 19(c).\n26\n27\nThe record also requires consideration of Guideline F mitigating conditions 20(a)  and\n28\n20(b).  Since 2003, most of Applicant\u2019s income has been obligated to support payments for his first\n29\nwife and their children. While under that obligation, Applicant relied on personal credit to make ends\nmeet and was unable to stay current on those accounts and other obligations. However, he has tried\nto live within his means while still preserving his ability to see his children, and despite an onerous\nsupport obligation imposed in his divorce. Only in the past few months, as a result of greatly\nincreased income and the end of his support obligations, has Applicant had sufficient funds with\nwhich to start paying down his debts. He has begun repaying his outstanding obligations, and it is\nunlikely he will incur such delinquencies in the future.\nThe mere presence or absence of delinquent debts does not end the inquiry into whether one\u2019s\nfinancial problems present an unacceptable security risk. The issue is whether Applicant\u2019s unpaid\ndebts put him at risk of engaging in illegal acts to generate funds to pay his debts, or whether his\nfinancial problems reflect adversely on his judgment, reliability, self-control, or willingness to follow\nrules and regulations. There is no denying Applicant still owes significant debts that will take time\nto repay. However, he did not incur the debt through mismanagement of his finances, through\nfrivolous spending, or through deceptive financial practices. Nor has he tried to evade his\nobligations. He now has the means to repay his debts while avoiding similar problems in the future.\nAll of the foregoing presents sufficient information showing he will not violate the government\u2019s\ntrust for financial reasons. Accordingly, the Guideline F security concerns are resolved in favor of\nthe Applicant.\nPersonal Conduct. Under Guideline E, \u201c[c]onduct involving questionable judgment, lack\nof candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. Of\nspecial interest is any failure to provide truthful and candid answers during the security clearance\nprocess or any other failure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\u201d  Through its Motion\n30\nto Amend, the government  alleged Applicant deliberately falsified answers to questions about his\nfinances in his March 2007 SF 86. The government submitted sufficient information, through the\nMarch 2007 SF 86 (Gx. 1) and the October 2003 SF 86, as updated in April and July 2004 (Gx. 2),\nto support the allegations of deliberate falsification.\n\n Normally, a request for clearance or to commence a periodic review would entail submission of an entirely\n31\nnew SF 86. Should the request for clearance be lost, it stands to reason the Applicant would have to resubmit a new\nquestionnaire.\n9\nThe March 2007 SF 86 cited in SOR \u00b6 2 plainly shows Applicant did not disclose adverse\nfinancial information in his background. As someone who has held a security clearance since 1989,\nhe knew or should have known the government would want to know about.\nI have considered Applicant\u2019s explanation that he was directed by one or more FSO\u2019s to only\nupdate information such as addresses and references. However, all of the information bearing on\nApplicant\u2019s intentions when he submitted his most recent SF 86 persuades me he knowingly\nwithheld information about judgments, wage garnishments, and delinquent credit accounts. As to\nhis omission of information about wage garnishments (SOR \u00b6 2.a), when he updated his SF 86 in\nJuly 2004, a garnishment against nearly half his pay had started the previous month. It was still in\neffect when he submitted his March 2007 SF 86. As to SOR \u00b6 2.b alleging he answered \u201cno\u201d to\nquestion 35 (repossessions), the allegation is technically defective. Applicant, in fact, answered \u201cyes\u201d\nand disclosed a repossession, albeit the repossession in 1998, as opposed to the 2006 repossession\npresented through SOR \u00b6 1.c. Nonetheless, this was his third repossession since 1990, and it had\noccurred less than a year before he signed and submitted his March 2007 SF 86. He omitted that\nevent even though he had declared two previous repossessions and had updated in 2004 the address\nof the creditor on his 1998 repossession. As to his omission of  unpaid civil judgments (SOR \u00b6 2.c),\nhe knew a judgment was filed against him for unpaid rent (SOR \u00b6 1.k). His omission of that debt\nmust be considered along with the fact he also omitted from his March 2007 SF 86 the address where\nhe was living when he failed to pay the rent. That address had been listed in his 2003 SF 86, which\nwas submitted and updated before the judgment was entered. Finally, Applicant does not contest that\nhe was aware when he submitted his March 2007 SF 86 that he owed several thousand dollars in\nunpaid credit accounts. The largest such account (SOR \u00b6 1.n) was a loan he obtained in 2004 to help\npay off delinquent credit cards.\nI have also considered the argument that Applicant disclosed some adverse information in\nhis October 2003, thereby putting the government on notice of his financial problems. However,\nbetween his October 2003 SF 86, through the two 2004 updates, and his March 2007 SF 86,\nApplicant\u2019s financial problems became much more serious than they had been in 2003 and 2004.\nMost of his debts became delinquent after his July 2004 update, yet Applicant did not see fit to\ndisclose any of them in March 2007. The government, therefore, was not given adequate notice about\nthe recency and severity of Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties.\nEven in light of the unusual circumstances surrounding Applicant\u2019s submission of his March\n2007 SF 86, and the submission and updates to his October 2003 SF 86,  I find Applicant\u2019s claims\n31\nhe relied on the guidance of his FSO\u2019s implausible. Having extensive experience in the clearance\nprocess, Applicant knew or should have known he was responsible for his answers and statements\nmade to the government. His assertion that an FSO knew of certain changes to be made in\nApplicant\u2019s questionnaire and directed those changes, but somehow limited Applicant from updating\npossibly adverse information, taken together with all of the evidence of his delinquent debts, is\nsimply untenable and strains credulity. On balance, I conclude Applicant deliberately, and of his own\nvolition, withheld information about his debts from his March 2007 SF 86. Accordingly, Guideline\n\n \u201cdeliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any personnel security questionnaire,\n32\npersonal history statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award\nbenefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities;\u201d\n \u201cthe refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was caused or significantly contributed to by\n33\nimproper or inadequate advice of authorized personnel or legal counsel advising or instructing the individual specifically\nconcerning the security clearance process. Upon being made aware of the requirement to cooperate or provide the\ninformation, the individual cooperated fully and truthfully;\u201d\n See footnote 17, supra.\n34\n Ax. D.\n35\n See footnote 24, supra.\n36\n See footnote 20, supra.\n37\n10\nE mitigating conditions 16(a)  must be considered, and I find Applicant\u2019s arguments in support of\n32\nmitigating condition 17(b)  wholly unpersuasive. The Guideline E security concerns are resolved\n33\nagainst the Applicant.\nWhole Person. I have evaluated the facts presented in this record and have applied the\nappropriate adjudicative factors, pro and con, under Guidelines E and F. I have also reviewed the\nrecord before me in the context of the whole person factors listed in section 2(a) of the Revised\nAdjudicative Guidelines.  It is uncontroverted that Applicant is an accomplished professional in his\n34\nfield, who has established an excellent military and civilian work record, and is highly regarded by\nhis peers and superiors at work.  Application of the whole person factors to Applicant\u2019s financial\n35\nproblems makes clear his delinquent debts were the result of his divorce and subsequent support\nobligations, which left him with little control over his financial destiny. Now that his circumstances\nhave changed, there is little potential he can be pressured because of his finances or that he will incur\nsimilar debts in the future. However, when these same factors are applied to his omission of adverse\nfinancial information from his SF 86, it is equally clear that he has engaged in serious misconduct,\nthat he did so knowingly and wilfully, and that he did so recently despite having extensive\nexperience in these matters. The record as a whole in this regard shows Applicant was trying to\nprotect his own interests by trying to retain his clearance so he would remain eligible for employment\non classified projects. Because he withheld such information in July 2004 and in March 2007, and\nabsent a satisfactory explanation of his conduct or an acceptance of responsibility for it, I conclude\nit is likely his lack of candor will continue to be a concern in the future. Despite the recent\nimprovement in his financial affairs, his deliberate falsification of his most recent security\nquestionnaire sustains the government\u2019s doubts about his judgment and trustworthiness. Such doubts\nmust be resolved in favor of the national security.  A fair and commonsense assessment  of all\n36\n37\navailable information before me shows that the Applicant has not yet overcome the government\u2019s\nreasonable doubts about his ability to protect classified information and to exercise the requisite\ngood judgment and discretion expected of one who holds a security clearance.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal findings regarding each SOR allegation are as follows:\n\n11\nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations):\nFOR THE APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a - 1.o:\nFor the Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline E (Personal Conduct):         \nAGAINST THE APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a - 2.d:\nAgainst the Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant.

CREAN\nAPPEARANCES\nFOR GOVERNMENT\nEric Borgstrom, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nSYNOPSIS\nApplicant has been a software quality assurance engineer for a defense contractor for over\n31 years.  In the 1994 time frame, he sexually molested young girls.  In 2004, the girls informed\nauthorities of Applicant\u2019s actions, and he pled guilty to three felony charges of child endangerment.\nHe was fined, sentenced to probation, and is a registered sex offender.  In 1994 and again in 2001,\nApplicant admittedly viewed pre-teen pornography on the internet.  He did not deliberately fail to\ncorrectly answer or provide complete information to security investigators during the course of a\nsecurity investigation.  Clearance is denied.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn July 12, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement\n\nGovernment Exhibit 1 (Memorandum, dated August 21, 2007).\n1\nApplicant waived the 15 day notice requirement.  Tr. at 7.\n2\nTr. 23-24.\n3\n2\nof Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its decision to deny a security clearance for Applicant.  The\naction was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry\n(February 20, 1990), as amended, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial\nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive).  The new\nadjudicative guidelines, promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective in the\nDepartment of Defense on September 1, 2006, will be used to adjudicate this case.  Applicant\nacknowledged receipt of the SOR on July 19, 2007.  The SOR alleges security concerns under\nGuideline D (Sexual Behavior), Guideline E (Personal Conduct), and Guideline J (Criminal\nConduct) of the new adjudicative guidelines.\nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on August 1, 2007.  He denied all allegations under\nGuideline D (Sexual Behavior).  However in his explanation, he admitted to the underlying actions\nbut denied that his actions now cause a security concern.  He admitted two of the allegation under\nGuideline E (Personal Conduct) and denied the others.  He admitted his security clearance had been\nrevoked by a Department of Defense agency and that a civil action was filed for his sexual behavior.\nHe denied he deliberately provided false or incomplete information during the security clearance\nprocess.  He denied the allegations under Guideline J (Criminal Conduct) not because the criminal\nactions did not take place, but that they no longer cause a security concern.  He requested that the\nmatter be resolved without a hearing.  However, the government, through Department Counsel,\nrequested a hearing before an Administrative Judge.   Department Counsel was prepared to proceed\n1\nwith the case on October 2, 2007.  The case was assigned to another Administrative Judge, and\nreassigned to me on November 5, 2007.  A notice of hearing was issued on November 5, 2007, and\nthe hearing convened on November 15, 2007.   Eleven government exhibits, marked Government\n2\nExhibits 1-11, were received and admitted without objection.  Four Applicant exhibits, marked\nApplicant Exhibits A-D, were received and admitted without objection.  The testimony of Applicant\nand one Applicant witness were received during the hearing.  The transcript (Tr.) was received by\nDOHA on November 27, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nAfter a thorough review of the pleadings, transcript, and exhibits, I make the following\nessential findings of fact.\nApplicant is 51 years old, a college graduate in electrical engineering, and employed by a\ndefense contractor for over 31 years as a software quality assurance engineer.  He has been married\nfor 28 years and has twin 23 year old daughters.  His father is deceased but his mother is still living.\nApplicant\u2019s father was disabled, and became an alcoholic when Applicant was young.  Applicant\nwas exposed as a youth to the pornography his father kept in the house.   \n3\n\nTr. 23-26; Government Exhibit 2 (Security Clearance Application, dated December 20, 2001).\n4\nAppellant Exhibit C (Letter, dated November 13, 2007).\n5\nResponse to SOR (Letter, dated July 25, 2007).\n6\nTr. 80-83.\n7\nTr. 26-30, 68.\n8\n18 U.S. C. 2252 and 18 U.S.C. 2252A.  18 U.S.C. 2252 was in effect in 1994 and was amended to 18 U.S.C.\n9\n2252A in 1998.  The criminal conduct was the same under both statutes and pertains to the act of using and viewing child\npornography which includes images of pre-teenagers.\nTr. 30-32, 54-55, 77; Government Exhibit 3 (Interrogatory, dated March 23, 2007).\n10\n3\nApplicant held a security clearance, including access to Sensitive Compartment Information\n(SCI), for over ten years.   Applicant\u2019s supervisor noted he is a hard worker and a man of excellent\n4\ncharacter.  He has complete confidence in his ability to protect classified information.  He does not\nbelieve Applicant would succumb to pressure to disclose or abuse classified information.5\nApplicant\u2019s minister provided a letter of recommendation that accompanied Applicant\u2019s response\nto the SOR.  The minister noted Applicant is treasurer of their church and has performed his duties\nwith competence and good humor.  Applicant also assisted members of the congregation with needed\ntransportation.  Applicant is a trusted and valued member of the Finance Committee and Church\nCouncil.   One of Applicant\u2019s daughters testified that her father is now a changed person from what\n6\nhe was like in the 1994 time frame.  He is a kinder and gentler person who she loves.  \n7\nDuring the time frame of 1994 to 1996, Applicant sexual molested two eight to ten year old\nsisters who were playmates of his daughters and lived next door to his family.  He took the girls to\na private room in his house and had them sit on his lap.   He fondled the girls, including their genital\nareas, exposed his penis to them, and had them touch it.  He is not sure of the number of times this\nhappened but it happened more than five times with one of the girls and at least once with the other\ngirl.  Some of the action happened under a blanket while other children were in the room.  There was\nno sexual intercourse or penetration.  The girls did not reveal his actions until they informed\nauthorities of the incidents ten years later in 2004.  A third child also told authorities that Applicant\nsexually molested her in the same manner during the same time frame.  Applicant admits that he was\nviewing pornography, to include adult pornography and pornography of pre-teen girls starting in the\nearly 1990s and continuing until at least 1995 and during the time he was molesting the girls.  He\nmasturbated while viewing the pornographic images.   Viewing child pornography, of which pre -\n8\nteen qualifies, is a violation of federal law.9\nHe also admitted he would consume five or six drinks of alcohol before molesting the girls\nto lower his inhibitions.   In a pre-sentencing session, Applicant denied he was under the influence\n10\n\nGovernment Exhibit 7 (Pre-sentencing report, dated August 19, 2005) at 2.\n11\nTr. 17-19, 42-46; Government Exhibit 7 (Sentencing Report, dated August 19, 2005).\n12\nTr. 45; Government Exhibit 9 (Sex Offender Registry, dated September 13, 2005).\n13\nTr. 60; Applicant Exhibit B (Medication Statement, dated May 9, 2007).\n14\nAppellant Exhibit A (Attorney\u2019s letter, dated May 2, 2007).\n15\nTr. 21-22; Applicant Exhibit D (Certificate of Baptism, dated April 23, 1995).\n16\nTr. 32-39.\n17\nGovernment Exhibit 6 (In-depth psychological evaluation, dated October 7, 2005).\n18\nTr. 39-40, 70.\n19\n4\nof drugs or alcohol at the time the girls were molested.11\nApplicant was charged by authorities with three felony counts of Endangering the Welfare\nof a Child.  He pled guilty to the three offenses.  He admitted drinking alcohol before molesting the\ngirls but denied being under the influence of alcohol or drugs at the time.  He was sentenced to three\nyears probation, fined $22,500, and court costs.  His probation runs until September 2008.  Applicant\ndenied that he molested the third girl but pled guilty on the advice of his attorney so he would be\nsentence to probation and not incarcerated.   He is a registered sex offender.   The two sisters and\n12\n13\ntheir family and the third girl filed civil suits for damages in 2006 for the sexual abuse.  Appellant\nsettled the suit by the two sisters  and paid civil damages to the girls and their families.   The action\n14\nby the third was dismissed with prejudice.15\nAfter his actions with the girls, Applicant  became active in his church, and was baptized into\nthe church in April 1995.   He did not drink alcohol or view pornography from 1995 until\n16\napproximately late 2000 when his father-in-law committed suicide.  He and his wife shared a six-\npack of beer at the time, and he again started accessing internet pornography.  He knew some of the\npornography to be of pre-teen girls.  He accessed pornography after his father-in-law\u2019s death a\nnumber of times in late 2000 to early 2001.  He stated he first viewed adult pornography and then\nwillingly looked at pornography labeled as pre-teen pictures.  He masturbated while viewing the\nadult and pre-teen images.17\nApplicant was examined by a forensic psychologist in 2005 as part of his sentence for child\nmolesting.  The psychologist concluded that his test scores fall in the low range for sexual recidivism\nand psychopathic tendencies.  He noted a concern for Applicant\u2019s sexual opportunistic behavior\ntowards children which requires him to have regular therapy.  The psychologist stated Applicant\nneeds to address deviant sexual arousal patterns, impulsive behaviors, and sexual fantasy. Applicant\ntold the psychologist he believes \u201che has corrected his past sexual problem and has not had any\nproblems for over nine years.\u201d   Applicant is not sure if he discussed with the psychologist that he\n18\nviewed pornography, including pre-teen images, in 2000-2001.  He is also not sure if he discussed\nwith the psychologist that he consumed beer in 2001.

During the interview on January 12, 2006,\nApplicant stated he was \u201creally into pornography\u201d in the 1990s and looked at areas of various interest\nincluding preteen girls and older women.  He did mention that he viewed adult pornography in 2001\nand masturbated while doing so.  There is no indication that he mentioned viewing pre-teen\npornography in 2001.  Applicant did state that he ceased consuming alcoholic beverages in 1995\nexcept for three beers in December 2001 and a champagne toast in approximately 2002.  In this same\ninterview, Applicant denied having a sexual encounter with the third girl.  He did state he pled guilty\nto the offense involving the third girl on the advice of his attorney.  The questions asked by the agent\nand Applicant\u2019s responses are clearly stated in the report of investigation.21\nApplicant was interviewed again by security agents on January 13, 2006.  In this interview,\nApplicant admitted viewing pre-teen child pornography in 2001.  He stated he did not mention this\nto the investigator the day before because he was embarrassed about his action of returning to\nviewing child pornography.  He admitted to sexual contact with the two young girls on a number of\noccasions.  He again denied any sexual contact with the third young girls.  He stated he provided the\ncorrect answers to all questions answered.  \n22\nApplicant informed his supervisor of the criminal offenses.  His co-workers do not know of\nthe offenses of child endangerment nor do they know of his viewing pornography, including pre-teen\npornography as late as 2004.  He also has not informed his children that he viewed pornography as\nlate as 2004.23\nPOLICIES\nThe President has \u201cthe authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national\nsecurity and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position . . .\nthat will give that person access to such information.\u201d   Eligibility for a security clearance is\n24\n\nDirective \u00b6 E2.2.1.\n25\nId.\n26\nAG 2(a).\n27\nSee Exec.

The\n25\nDirective and the new guidelines sets out the adjudicative guidelines for making decisions on security\nclearances, listing the disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions for each guideline.  Each\nclearance decision must be fair, impartial, and a commonsense decision based on the relevant and\nmaterial facts and circumstances, the whole person concept, and the factors listed in the Directive \u00b6\n6.3.1 through \u00b6 6.3.6.\nThe adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make\nan affirmative determination that the person is eligible for a security clearance.  An administrative\njudge must apply the \u201cwhole person concept,\u201d and consider and carefully weigh the available, reliable\ninformation about the person.   An administrative judge should consider: (1) the nature, extent, and\n26\nseriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the applicant\u2019s age and maturity at the\ntime of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation\nand other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for\npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation of recurrence.27\nA person granted access to classified information enters into a special relationship with the\ngovernment.  The government must be able to repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those\nindividuals to whom it grants access to classified information.  The decision to deny an individual a\nsecurity clearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant.   It is merely\n28\nan indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of\nDefense have established for issuing a clearance.\nInitially, the Government must present evidence to establish controverted facts in the SOR that\ndisqualify or may disqualify the Applicant from being eligible for access to classified information.29\nThereafter, Applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate\nfacts.   An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the\n30\nnational interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d   The government is under no duty to\n31\npresent evidence to disprove any Adjudicative Guideline mitigating condition, and an Administrative\nJudge cannot assume or infer that any particular mitigating condition is applicable merely because the\ngovernment does not present evidence to disprove that particular mitigating condition.   \u201c[T]he\n32\nDirective presumes there is a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the\n\nISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 (App. Bd.

I\nreach the following conclusions regarding the allegations in the SOR.\nSexual behavior that involves a criminal offense causes a security concern because it indicates\na personality or emotional disorder, reflects lack of judgment or discretion, may subject the individual\nto undue influence or coercion, exploitation, or duress, and can raise questions about an individuals\nreliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information.35\nApplicant sexually molested three minor children and was convicted of three felony charges\nof child endangerment.  This establishes Sexual Behavior Disqualifying Conditions (SB DC) \u00b6 13(a)\nSexual behavior of a criminal nature, whether or not the individual has been prosecuted, SB DC \u00b6\n13(b) A pattern of compulsive, self-destructive, or high risk behavior that the person is unable to stop\nor that may be symptomatic of a personality disorder, SB DC \u00b6 13(c) Sexual behavior that causes an\nindividual to be vulnerable to coercion exploitation or duress, and SB DC \u00b6 13(d) Sexual behavior of\na public nature and/or that reflects lack of discretion or judgment.  Applicant was convicted of three\ncriminal offenses.  Child molestation is not normal activity and may be a symptom of a personality\ndisorder.  Child molestation is so against the societal norm that it leaves the person subject to coercion,\nexploitation, or duress.  It is such an abhorrent and abnormal action that it reflects lack of discretion\nor judgment.\nI considered Sexual Behavior Mitigating Conditions (SB MC) \u00b6 14(a) The behavior occurred\nprior to or during adolescence and there is no evidence of subsequent conduct of a similar nature, SB\nMC \u00b6 14(b) The sexual behavior happened so long ago, so infrequently, or under such unusual\ncircumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability,\ntrustworthiness, or good judgment, SB MC \u00b6 14(c) The behavior no longer serves as a basis for\ncoercion exploitation, or duress, and SB MC \u00b6 14(d) The sexual behavior is strictly private,\nconsensual, and discreet.  I determine that none apply.  Applicant was 39 to 40 years old, an adult and\nfather, when he molested the young girls, so his actions were not that of an adolescent.  While the\nmolestation took place over 13 years ago, Applicant used pornography as late as three years ago which\n\nAG \u00b6 15.\n36\n10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001.\n37\n8\nshows he has not resolved his issues and that his actions are likely to recur.  While Applicant\u2019s\nsupervisor may know of his actions and he is a registered sex offender which is public knowledge, not\nall of his co-workers nor his daughters know of all of his actions so he is still subject to coercion,\nexploitation, or duress.  The nature of molestation of young girls is illegal and socially unacceptable\nconduct and discretion is not mitigating under any circumstances.  Applicant has not mitigated the\nsecurity concerns for his sexual behavior.\nPersonal conduct is always a security concern because the conduct involving questionable\njudgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or an unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can\nraise question about an individual\u2019s reliability trustworthiness and ability to protect classified\ninformation.  Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful and candid answers during the\nsecurity process or any other failure to cooperate with the security clearance process.36\nThe SOR allegations under Personal Conduct are Applicant provided false information or\nomitted certain information when interviewed by security officials and medical personnel.  This raises\nPersonal Conduct Disqualifying Condition \u00b6 16(b) Deliberately providing false or misleading\ninformation concerning relevant facts to an employer, investigator, security official competent medical\nauthority or other official government representative.  The security clearance system depends on an\nindividual providing correct and accurate information.  If a person conceals or provides false\ninformation, the security clearance process cannot function properly to ensure granting access to\nclassified information is in the best interest of the United States Government.  The crux of the security\nconcern is the deliberateness of the action in providing false information.  A falsification must be\ndeliberate and material.  It is deliberate if it is done knowingly and willfully.  A deliberate omission\nor providing false statement to security investigators is a criminal offense under federal law.   \n37\nThe specific SOR allegations include Applicant\u2019s failure to provide information in the January\n12, 2006, interview that in addition to adult pornography he viewed pre-teen pornography, that he\nprovided inaccurate information concerning consumption of alcohol (three beers) after 1995, that he\ndenied in the two interviews he molested the third girl; that he did not accurately state the number of\ntimes he molested the girls; that he did not inform his psychologist or therapist that he viewed\npornography on the internet and drank alcohol in 2001; and that he stated he was not under the\ninfluence of alcohol when he molested the girls.  The information or evidence developed by the \ngovernment to establish falsification or omission by Applicant are \u201csound bites\u201d from reports of\ninvestigation, medical reports, or similar documents.  \nThe report of the January 12, 2006, interview shows Applicant responded that he viewed\npornography in 2001.  The government alleged he should have stated some of the pornography was\npre-teen pornography.  However, Applicant correctly answered the questions asked.  He was not asked\nabout preteen pornography and correctly answered the question asked. \nHe consistently has stated he did not molest the third girl.  While he plead guilty to the offense\nas a legal tactic, this does not establish he deliberately provided false information concerning the third\n\nAG \u00b6 30.\n38\n9\ngirl when he said he did not molested her.  His response concerning the third girl has always been\nconsistent. \nThe government alleged that Applicant did not state in the January 12, 2006, interview that he\ndrank alcohol in 2001.  In the report it clearly states he did tell the agent about his consumption of\nthree beers in 2001.  \nThe government alleges that Applicant did not accurately state the number of times he molested\nthe girls.  Applicant stated the number of times he believed he molested the two girls and also said he\nwas unsure of the actual number.  While Applicant stated he drank alcohol before molesting the girls,\nhe stated in the pre-sentencing interview that he was not under the influence of alcohol when he\nmolested the girls.  The government presented no information as to the questions asked by the\ninterviewing probation officer, nor Applicant\u2019s understand of the potential difference between\nintoxication and influence.  The government attempted to boot strap being under the influence of\nalcohol by the number of drinks consumed.  This does not indicate a deliberate intention to provide\nfalse information with the intent to deceive.\nThe government alleges Applicant provided incorrect information to the psychologist and\ntherapist.  The information concerning the psychologist is based on an alleged quote from Applicant\nin the psychologist\u2019s report.  There is no indication of the questions the psychologist or therapist asked\nApplicant.  The sound bites in the reports are pure hearsay that does not establish any facts.  Similarly,\nthe information concerning what was told the therapist is nothing more than the conclusion reached\nby another government agency and does not clearly establish Applicant deliberately provided false or\nmisleading information.  \nIn sum, the government has failed to presenting relevant, material, and competent information\nto establish falsification by Applicant when providing information to security investigators or medical\npersonnel.  The evidence relied on by the government is in most cases pure hearsay information from\nmultiple sources and thus not reliable to establish falsification or omission..  \nThe government also alleges as security concerns that a government agency revoked\nApplicant\u2019s security clearance, and that the two girls molested and their families filed a civil action\nagainst Applicant because of his actions.  While the facts as alleged are true and not denied by\nApplicant, the action of the government agency and the girls family are not issues that raise security\nconcerns for Applicant.  The allegations under Guideline E, Personal Conduct, are resolved for\nApplicant.\nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness.  By\nits very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with law, rules, and\nregulations.38\nApplicant pled guilty to and was sentenced in 2004 for three felony offenses of child\nendangerment.  He is still serving probation as part of his sentence for these offenses.  Applicant also\nadmitted he viewed child pornography on the internet in 1994-1995, and 2001.  These factors raise\nCriminal Conduct Disqualifying Conditions (CC DC) \u00b6 31(a) a single serious crime or multiple lesser\n\n10\noffenses, and CC DC \u00b6 31(d) Individual is currently on parole or probation.  The government has also\nalleged criminal conduct based upon violations of criminal conduct for deliberately providing false\ninformation or omitting information to security investigators or medical personnel.  Since the\ngovernment has failed to establish deliberate falsification, the criminal conduct of providing  false\ninformation is not established.\nI considered the Criminal Conduct Mitigating Conditions (CC MC) for the criminal\nconvictions, especially CC MC 32(a) So much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened,\nor it happened under such unusual circumstances that is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on\nthe individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgement , and CC MC 32(d) There is evidence\nof successful rehabilitation, including but not limited to the passage of time without recurrence of\ncriminal activity, remorse or restitution, job training or higher education, good employment record,\nor construction community involvement.  While the child endangerment happened in 1994, Applicant\ndid not tell anyone of the offenses.  His action only came to light when the girls matured and filed a\ncriminal complaint in 2004.  The criminal action is current and Applicant is still on probation.  He\nviewed child pornography as late as 2001.   There is some evidence of rehabilitation in that after\nApplicant molested the girls, he turned to his religion to help him, has completed college, and has a\ngood employment record.  However, he is still registered as a sex offender and on probation for his\ncriminal conduct.  He also used pre-teen pornography as late as 2001.  Applicant has not mitigated\nsecurity concerns for his criminal conduct of child endangerment and viewing child pornography.\nThe determination of Applicant\u2019s security worthiness requires a very careful and full analysis\nof his conduct under the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept.  The adjudication of security worthiness is an\nexamination of a sufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the\nperson is an acceptable security risk.  I considered that he turned to religion to assist him in 1995 and\nis a valued member of his church community.  I considered he is a good worker who has held a\nsecurity clearance for over 15 years.  His pastor and supervisor have confidence in him.  I considered\nApplicant\u2019s felony convictions for child endangerment by molesting the young girls in 1994, and\nviewing child pornography in 1994 and 2001.   The allegations in the SOR, taken together with a\nconsideration of the \u201cwhole person,\u201d indicate a individual who is not trustworthy or reliable and does\nnot exercise good judgment.  Applicant has not mitigated the sexual behavior or criminal conduct\nsecurity concerns.  His past history of exercising poor judgment by molesting children and viewing\nchild pornography establishes a concern that he could be blackmailed and may engage in conduct that\ndoes not safeguard classified information.  Applicant\u2019s conduct indicates he is a security risk.  I\nconclude he is not eligible for access to classified information.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required\nby Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive are;\nParagraph 1, Guideline D: \nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a.:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraphs 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraphs 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraphs 1.d:\nAgainst Applicant\n\n11\nSubparagraphs 1.e:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraphs 1.f:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline E: \nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.d:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.e:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.f:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.g:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.h:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.i:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.j:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 3, Guideline J: \nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 3.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 3.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 3.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 3.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all of the circumstances in the record in this case, it is not clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.

Applicant testified that he had paid off one small\ndebt and had mailed a check to pay another small debt three days before the hearing, but provided\nno corroborating evidence.  Applicant had done little else to settle his debts.  Applicant testified that\nhe was unaware that he had debts that were delinquent by 180 or 90 days when he filled out his\nsecurity clearance application and therefore did not deliberately falsify the application.  The Judge\nheld the record open for three weeks for Applicant to submit further information about his attempts\nto satisfy his debts, and Applicant submitted documents twice during that period.\nApplicant\u2019s post-hearing submissions are contained in the record.  There is a rebuttable\npresumption that a Judge has considered all the evidence in the record before her unless she\nspecifically states otherwise.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 2 (App. Bd. Jun. 4, 2001).\nMoreover, the Judge stated in her decision that Applicant submitted materials after the hearing, and\nshe set out the terms of an agreement that Applicant entered into which was part of the post-trial\nmaterials.  See Decision at 2 and 3. \nIt is clear that the Judge received the materials Applicant submitted and considered them in\nreaching her decision.  The fact that she did not accord them the weight Applicant would have\naccorded them is not indicative of error on the part of the Judge.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 07-01659\nat 2 (Feb. 22, 2008).

Goldstein, Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nSYNOPSIS\nApplicant\u2019s financial indebtedness remains outstanding.  He has only recently entered into\na debt management program to assist him in resolving his indebtedness and as of yet has made only\none payment toward the program.  More time is needed in order to show that he is financially\nresponsible.  His intentional falsifications on his security clearance concerning his delinquent\nfinancial history have also not been mitigated.  Clearance is denied.  \n\n2\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn April 11, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to\nExecutive Order 10865 (as amended), and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive),\ndated January 2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant, which detailed the\nreasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it\nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the\nApplicant and recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether a clearance\nshould be denied or revoked.\nThe Applicant responded to the SOR on May 14, 2007, and he requested a hearing before a\nDOHA Administrative Judge.  This case was assigned to the undersigned on June 22, 2007.  A\nnotice of hearing was issued on July 26, 2007, scheduling the hearing for August 16, 2007.  The\nmatter was rescheduled for September 13, 2007.  At the hearing the Government presented eight\nexhibits.  The Applicant presented three exhibits and testified on his own behalf.  The record was\nleft open until October 3, 2007, to allow the Applicant an opportunity to provide additional evidence.\nThe Applicant submitted two Post-Hearing Exhibits, referred to as A and B that were admitted into\nevidence and the record was closed on October 4, 2007.  The official transcript (Tr.) was received\non September 24, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nThe following Findings of Fact are based on the Applicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR, the\ntestimony and the exhibits.  The Applicant is 41 years old and has a high school diploma and two\nyears of college.   He is employed by a defense contractor as a Core Battle System Computer\nTechnician and is seeking to obtain a security clearance in connection with his employment.  \nThe Government opposes the Applicant's request for a security clearance, on the basis of\nallegations set forth in the Statement of Reasons (SOR).  After a complete and thorough review of\nthe evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of the same, the following findings of fact\nare entered as to each paragraph and guideline in the SOR:\nParagraph 1 (Guideline F - Financial Considerations)  The Government alleges that the Applicant\nis ineligible for a security clearance because he is financially overextended and at risk to engage in\nillegal acts to generate funds. \nThe Applicant admits the delinquent debts set forth in allegations, 1(b), 1(c),1(e), and 1(f).\nHe denies the debts set forth in allegations 1(a), 1(d),and 1(g).   (See Applicant\u2019s Answer to the\nSOR).  The Applicant retired from the military as an E-6 and receives a monthly pension.  Since\n2004, he has been on assignment in Korea, working for a defense contractor 40 hours a week in a\npart-time position that offers no benefits under this contract.  He and his wife have three children.\nThey separated two years ago and he is paying her monthly child support.  They plan to divorce when\nthey return to the states. \n\n3\nCredit reports of the Applicant indicate that he is indebted to seven separate creditors totaling\nan amount in excess of $17,000.00.  (See Government Exhibits, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6).   A debt to Citibank\nin the amount of $2,744.00 remains delinquent and outstanding.  A debt to Cingular Wireless in the\namount of $175.00 remains delinquent and outstanding.  The Applicant states that three days before\nthe hearing, on September 10, 2007, he mailed a check for payment to another creditor, Brook Mays\nin the amount of $395.00.  The check has not yet cleared his account.  A debt to Providian in the\namount of $5,826.00 remains outstanding.  The Applicant states that he has paid off the debt to\nMidland or Fingerhut in the amount of $215.00.  A debt to Green Tree for a mobile home he\ncosigned for, in the amount of $7,709.00 remains delinquent and outstanding.  The Applicant has\ntried to contact several of the creditors, but has had difficulty doing so because of the time difference\nbetween the United States and Korea.  (See Applicant\u2019s Answer to SOR).     \nAt the time of the hearing, the Applicant had structured a proposed payment plan in order to\npay off his outstanding debts, however, the plan had not been approved by any of his creditors.  (See\nApplicant\u2019s Exhibit A).  \nThe Applicant claims that he was not aware of these delinquent debts until they were brought\nto his attention by the investigative agent in July 2006.  He blames his wife for charging up some of\nthe credit cards, but admits that he was also a named party on the accounts.  Assuming the Applicant\ndid not know about these delinquent debts until he met with the investigator in July 2006, he still did\nnot use good judgment or make a good faith effort to resolve them in a timely fashion.    \nApplicant\u2019s Post-Hearing Exhibits contain documentation showing that on September 17,\n2007, after the hearing, he contacted a consumer credit counselor and set up a debt management\nagreement that requires that he pay $390.00 per month, his first payment being due September 19,\n2007.  Documentation shows that the Applicant made his first payment of $390.00.  (See Applicant\u2019s\nPost-Hearing Exhibits A and B).  \nParagraph 2 (Guideline E - Personal Conduct).  The Government alleges that the Applicant is\nineligible for a security clearance because he intentionally falsified material aspects of his personal\nbackground during the employment process.\nThe Applicant completed a Security Clearance application dated November 5, 2004.\nQuestion 38 of the application asked the Applicant if, in the last seven years, he has ever been more\nthen 180 days delinquent on any debts.  The Applicant answered, \u201cNO\u201d.  (See Government Exhibit\n1).  This was a false answer.  The Applicant failed to disclose that he was over 180 days delinquent\non the debts set forth in the SOR.  (See Government Exhibit 1 and Applicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR).\n   \nQuestion 39 of the same application asked the Applicant if he was currently 90 days\ndelinquent on any debts.  The Applicant answered, \u2018NO\u201d.  (See Government Exhibit 1).  This was\na false answer.  The Applicant explained that in response to both question 38 and 39, when he\ncompleted the application, he did not believe that he was behind on any of his debts.  He stated that\nhe only learned of these delinquent debts in July 2006, when the investigative agent brought them\nto his attention.  Prior to this time, he had not reviewed his credit report and was simply not aware.\n\n4\nHis wife handled the bills in the household and he did not know that he was as far behind as he was.\n(Tr. pp. 34-35).  \nI find that the Applicant knew or should have known about his delinquent debts and that he\nshould have revealed them on his security clearance application.  The Applicant held a security\nclearance during his career in the military and understood the importance associated with the security\nclearance application.  He knew that the information on the application needed to be accurate and\nreliable.  The fact that he had never looked at his credit report does not forgive the fact that he is\nresponsible for knowing what credit accounts he has opened up and what he owes his creditors.   He\nshould have revealed this information on his application.  Accordingly, I find that the Applicant\ndeliberately attempted to conceal this information from the Government on his security clearance\napplication.  \nPOLICIES\nEnclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudication policies divided into \"Disqualifying\nFactors\" and \"Mitigating Factors.\"  The following Disqualifying Factors and Mitigating Factors are\nfound to be applicable in this case:\nGuideline F (Financial Considerations)\n18.  The Concern.  Failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial\nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and\nregulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and\nability to protect classified information.  An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of\nhaving to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.  Compulsive gambling is a concern as it may lead\nto financial crimes including espionage.  Affluence that cannot be explained by known sources of\nincome is also a security concern.  It may indicate proceeds from financially profitable criminal acts.\n19.  Conditions that could raise a security concern:\n19(a)\n inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts;\n19(c)\n a history of not meeting financial obligations.\nConditions that could mitigate security concerns:\nNone.\nGuideline E (Personal Conduct)\n15.  The Concern.  Conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions about an individual\u2019s\n\n5\nreliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information.  OF special interest is any\nfailure to provide truthful and candid answers during the security clearance process or any other\nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\n16.  Condition that could raise a security concern:\n16(a)  The deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant and material facts\nfrom any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to\nconduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine\nsecurity clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities.\nCondition that could mitigate security concerns:\nNone.\nIn addition, as set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive at pages 16-17,  in evaluating the\nrelevance of an individual\u2019s conduct, the Administrative Judge should consider the following general\nfactors:\n a.  The nature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding circumstances\nb.  The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation\nc.  The frequency and recency of the conduct\nd.  The individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct\ne.  The voluntariness of participation\nf.  The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavior changes\ng.  The motivation for the conduct \nh. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress\n \ni.  The likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nThe eligibility criteria established in the DoD Directive identify personal characteristics and\nconduct which are reasonably related to the ultimate question, posed in Section 2 of Executive Order\n10865, of whether it is \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d to grant an Applicant\u2019s request\nfor access to classified information.\nThe DoD Directive states, \u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period\nof a person\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the person is an acceptable security risk.\nEligibility for access to classified information is predicted upon the individual meeting these\n\n6\npersonnel security guidelines.  The adjudicative process is the careful weighing of a number of\nvariables known as the whole person concept.  Available, reliable information about the person, past\nand present, favorable and unfavorable should be considered in reaching a determination.\u201d The\nAdministrative Judge can draw only those inferences or conclusions that have reasonable and logical\nbasis in the evidence of record.  The Judge cannot draw inferences or conclusions based on evidence\nwhich is speculative or conjectural in nature.  Finally, as emphasized by President Eisenhower in\nExecutive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under this order . . . shall be a determination in terms\nof the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the Applicant\nconcerned.\u201d\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn the defense industry, a security clearance is entrusted to civilian workers who must be\ncounted upon to safeguard such sensitive information twenty-four hours per day, seven days per\nweek.  The Government is therefore appropriately concerned when available information indicates\nthat an Applicant for such access may be involved in instances of financial irresponsibility and\ndishonesty which demonstrates poor judgment or unreliability.\nIt is the Government\u2019s responsibility to present substantial evidence to support the finding\nof a nexus, or rational connection, between the Applicant\u2019s conduct and the holding of a security\nclearance.  If such a case has been established, the burden then shifts to the Applicant to go forward\nwith evidence in rebuttal, explanation or mitigation which is sufficient to overcome or outweigh the\nGovernment\u2019s case.  The Applicant bears the ultimate burden of persuasion in proving that it is\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant him a security clearance.\nIn this case the Government has met its initial burden of proving that the Applicant has been\nfinancially irresponsible (Guideline F) and he has been untruthful on his Public Trust Position\napplication (Guideline E).  This evidence indicates poor judgment, unreliability and\nuntrustworthiness on the part of the Applicant.  Because of the scope and nature of the Applicant's\nconduct, I conclude there is a nexus or connection with his security clearance eligibility.\nConsidering all of the evidence, the Applicant has not introduced persuasive evidence in\nrebuttal, explanation or mitigation that is sufficient to overcome the Government's case.  With\nrespect to his finances, the Applicant has in excess of $17,000.00 in delinquent debt.  He has recently\npaid off two of the small debts, however, he has a long way to go before he is debt free.  He has\nrecently entered into a debt management agreement with a consumer counselor to assist him in\npaying off his delinquent debts, and at this time, he has made only one payment toward the program.\nHe has just started to address his delinquent debts and has a long way to go before they are resolved.\nAt the present time, he has not presented sufficient evidence to demonstrate a track record of\nfinancial responsibility or that he has resolved his financial indebtedness.\n  \n\n7\nUpon review of his financial statement,  it appears that he has some disposable income at the\nend of the month that he plans to use to pay his past due bills.  However, at the present time, he has\nonly started the process, and there is little evidence of financial rehabilitation.  Under Guideline F\n(Financial Considerations), Disqualifying Conditions 19(a)  inability or unwillingness to satisfy\ndebts and 19(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations apply.  None of the mitigating\nconditions apply.  His financial problems remain current, they are not isolated, and the Applicant has\nnot initiated a prompt, good faith effort to repay his overdue creditors or otherwise resolve his debts.\n Accordingly, I find against the Applicant under Guideline F (Financial Considerations).  \nWith respect to Guideline E, the Applicant contends that he did not know about his\ndelinquent debts.  This excuse is unacceptable.  The Applicant should have known about his debts\nand should have revealed these delinquent debts on his security clearance application.  With the\nparticular evidence that I have been provided, there is no reasonable excuse for his failure to answer\nthe questions truthfully.  Consequently, the evidence shows that the Applicant has not been\ncompletely honest with the Government regarding his financial history and he sought to conceal the\ntruth.  Disqualifying Condition 16(a)  the deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of\nrelevant and material facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement,\nor similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits\nor status, determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary\nresponsibilities applies.  None of the mitigating conditions are applicable.  I find that the Applicant\ndeliberately failed to reveal this information to the Government.  \nOn balance, it is concluded that the Applicant has failed to overcome the Government's case\nopposing his request for a security clearance.  Accordingly, the evidence supports a finding against\nthe Applicant as to the factual and conclusionary allegations expressed in Paragraphs 1 and 2 of the\nGovernment's Statement of Reasons.     \nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal findings For or Against the Applicant on the allegations in the SOR, as required by\nParagraph 25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive are:\nParagraph 1: Against the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.a.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.b.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.c.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.d.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.e.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n\n8\n    Subpara.  1.f.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.g.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\nParagraph 2: Against the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  2.a.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  2.b.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\nDECISION\nIn light of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly consistent\nwith the national interests to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant.\n  Darlene Lokey Anderson\nAdministrative Judge\n",

He is not subject to foreign influence\nbecause of family members residing in South Korea. Clearance denied.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nApplicant challenges the 25 May 2007 Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) recommending denial or revocation of his clearance because of\n\nRequired by Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, as amended and\n1\nmodified\u2014most recently in August 2006 (Directive).\nAlthough not alleged in the SOR, he similarly failed to disclose any financial difficulties he was experiencing\n2\nas a result of his failed business venture, which he closed in July 2000.\n2\nfinancial considerations, foreign influence, and personal conduct .  Applicant answered the SOR 20\n1\nJuly 2007, and requested a hearing. DOHA assigned the case to me 24 September 2007, and I\nconvened a hearing 30 October 2007. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) 9 November 2007.\nPROCEDURAL RULINGS\nAt hearing, I granted Department Counsel\u2019s motion to strike SOR 3.c. (Tr. 9-10). I also\ngranted Department Counsel\u2019s motion to take administrative notice of certain U.S. Government\npublications regarding the Republic of Korea (South Korea)(Tr. 22).\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant admitted the allegations of SOR 1.b., 1.c., 1.f., 2.a., and 2.d. Accordingly, I\nincorporate his admissions as findings of fact.\nApplicant\u2014a 38-year-old systems engineer employed by a defense contractor since January\n2001\u2014seeks to retain the access to classified information he has had since approximately 2002.\nWhen Applicant completed his clearance application in October 2001 (G.E. 1), he failed to\ndisclose any foreign travel within the last seven years (question 16).  In fact, he had traveled to the\n2\nRepublic of Korea four times within the last five years: July 1996, May 1998, November 1999, and\nNovember 2000. When he completed a second clearance application in March 2006 (G.E. 2), he\nagain failed to disclose any foreign travel within the last seven years (question 18), omitting his\nNovember 1999 and November 2000 trips to the Republic of Korea. Applicant\u2019s explanation for his\nomissions\u2014that we was confused about the question and his dates of travel (Tr. 62-64, 78)\u2014is\nunconvincing, particularly regarding his October 2001 application, when he had traveled to the\nRepublic of Korea within the last year.\nApplicant has a history of financial difficulties dating to at least July 2000, when he closed\na failed business venture\u2014and found himself unable to keep up the payments on credit accounts he\nand his wife had opened to fund the business. The SOR alleges seven delinquent debts totaling over\n$51,000. Record evidence shows that Applicant had paid the account at SOR1.e. in 2003 (A.E. E),\nthat the account at SOR 1.b. and 1.f. are the same account, and that the account at SOR 1.d. and 1.g.\nare the same account. Accordingly, I find SOR 1.b., 1.e., and 1.g. for Applicant. Applicant denied\nthe debt at SOR 1.a. on th grounds that the account was not his, he was merely an authorized user\non a business account of a previous employer. However, his evidence supporting that claim (A.E.\nG), shows an account number that does not appear on any of the credit reports in the record, and that\naccount number is different from the debts alleged in the SOR, is listed as a joint obligation of\n\n3\nApplicant, and was opened before Applicant went to work for that employer (who was the first\nemployer Applicant went to work for after he closed his business).\nOf the three business debts Applicant acknowledges, the debt at SOR 1.c. (A.E. B) and 1.d.\n(A.E. D) were paid and settled for less than the full amount of the debt by the original creditors\nsuccessors-in-interest in July 2007\u2014about the time Applicant answered the SOR. The debt at SOR\n1.f. was paid and settled for less than the full amount of the debt in September 2007 (A.E. C). Credit\nreports in the record reflect that Applicant paid off a mortgage on a previous home in 2002, but had\nbeen slow to pay his mortgage around 2000-2001 when his business was failing. Nevertheless, he\nand his wife bought a second home, and a condominium that they rent. He claims to have never been\nlate on those mortgage payments.\nApplicant immigrated to the U.S. from the Republic of Korea (South Korea) in 1986, and has\nresided here since. He married his wife\u2014another native-born South Korean he met in the U.S.\u2014in\nMarch 1995.  They have two sons, both U.S.-born citizens. Applicant became a naturalized U.S.\ncitizen in April 1997; his wife in February 1998. South Korea does not recognize dual citizenship,\nand Applicant\u2019s wife lost her South Korean citizenship when she filed a report of her U.S.\nnaturalization with South Korean government officials in September 2001 (A.E. H). Applicant and\nhis wife own their home in the U.S. They have no financial interests in South Korea. Applicant has\nregistered with the U.S. Selective Service, as required. \nApplicant\u2019s brother is a naturalized U.S. citizen, residing in the U.S. His mother, step-father,\nand step-brother are all legal permanent residents of the U.S., residing in the U.S.. They have all\nresided in the U.S. over 20 years. His mother has applied for her U.S. citizenship. He has more\ndistant relatives\u2014including an aunt who he has not seen in 10-15 years\u2014who are resident citizens\nof South Korea.\nThe South Korean government has an aggressive, effective intelligence-gathering operation\nthat targets economic and proprietary information in the U.S. However, its human rights practices\nare generally respectful of democratic institutions. There is no evidence that it seeks to obtain\neconomic and proprietary information by pressuring its citizens through their ex-patriot relatives\nliving in the U.S.\nApplicant\u2019s co-worker considers him an honest employee and recommends him for his\nclearance. However, he does not appear to be aware of Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties or his\nfalsification of his clearance applications.\nPOLICIES AND BURDEN OF PROOF\nThe Revised Adjudicative Guidelines lists factors to be considered in evaluating an\nApplicant\u2019s suitability for access to classified information. Administrative Judges must assess both\ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions under each adjudicative issue fairly raised by the facts and\ncircumstances presented. Each decision must also reflect a fair and impartial common sense\nconsideration of the factors listed in Section 6.3. of the Directive. The presence or absence of a\ndisqualifying or mitigating condition is not determinative for or against Applicant. However, specific\nadjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against them, as they\n\nSee, Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988).\n3\n\u00b619.(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; (b) indebtedness caused by frivolous or irresponsible\n4\nspending and the absence of any evidence of willingness or intent to pay the debt or establish a realistic plan to pay the\ndebt; (c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; . . . (e) consistent spending beyond one\u2019s means, which may be\nindicated by excessive indebtedness, significant negative cash flow, high debt-to-income ratio, and/or other financial\nanalysis;\n\u00b620 (a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is\n5\nunlikely to recur . . . \n\u00b620.(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control . . . and\n6\nthe individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;\n4\nrepresent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to classified information.\nConsidering the SOR allegations and the evidence as a whole, the relevant, applicable, adjudicative\nguidelines are guidelines F (Financial Considerations), B (Foreign Influence), and E (Personal\nConduct).\nSecurity clearance decisions resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest\nto grant or continue an Applicant\u2019s security clearance. The government must prove, by something\nless than a preponderance of the evidence, controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If it does so, it\nestablishes a prima facie case against access to classified information. Applicant must then refute,\nextenuate, or mitigate the government\u2019s case. Because no one has a right to a security clearance, the\nApplicant bears a heavy burden of persuasion.\nPersons with access to classified information enter into a fiduciary relationship with the\ngovernment based on trust and confidence. Therefore, the government has a compelling interest in\nensuring each Applicant possesses the requisite judgement, reliability, and trustworthiness of those\nwho must protect national interests as their own. The \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d\nstandard compels resolution of any reasonable doubt about an Applicant\u2019s suitability for access in\nfavor of the government.3\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe government established a case for disqualification under Guideline F, and Applicant did\nnot mitigate the security concerns. Government records reflect nearly $28,000 of delinquent debt\nacquired before July 2000, that remained unaddressed until mid-to-late 2007\u2014for practical purposes\nuntil the eve of the hearing.  Applicant attributes these financial problems to his failed business\n4\nventure, arguably a circumstance beyond his control. However, as his finances improved, he failed\nto address the delinquent debts until faced with the security concerns raised by the government.\nFurther, as his finances improved, he chose to purchase a new home and an investment property\nahead of addressing his past-due debts. \nApplicant meets one of the mitigating factors for financial considerations. His financial\ndifficulties are both recent and multiple.  While the debts were due to circumstances beyond his\n5\ncontrol, he did not act responsibly in addressing his debts.  There is no evidence that he has sought\n6\n\n\u00b620.(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and there are clear indications that\n7\nthe problem is being resolved or is under control;\n\u00b620.(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.\n8\nRevised Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 6.\n9\nRevised Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 7.(a).\n10\n5\ncredit counseling or otherwise brought the problem under control.  Although he paid  his outstanding\n7\ndebts just after the SOR was issued, and just before the hearing, the timing of the payments does not\nconstitute a good-faith effort to satisfy his debts.  Further, given his unwillingness to seek or use\n8\nfinancial counseling, there is nothing in the record to suggest that Applicant will put his financial\nproblem behind him. I conclude Guideline F against Applicant.\nUnder Guideline B (Foreign Influence), an applicant\u2019s foreign contacts and interests may\nraise security concerns if the individual 1) has divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, 2) may\nbe manipulated or induced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way\ncontrary to U.S. interests, or 3) is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Foreign\ninfluence adjudications can and should consider the identity of the foreign country in which the\nforeign contact or financial interest is located\u2014including, but not limited to, whether the country is\nknown to target U.S. citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a risk of\nterrorism.  Evaluation of an individual\u2019s qualifications for access to protected information requires\n9\ncareful assessment of both the foreign entity\u2019s willingness and ability to target protected information,\nand to target ex-patriots who are U.S. citizens to obtain that information, and the individual\u2019s\nsusceptibility to influence, whether negative or positive. More specifically, an individual\u2019s contacts\nwith foreign family members (or other foreign entities or persons) raise security concerns only if\nthose contacts create a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure,\nor coercion.10\nIn this case, the government failed to establish a case for disqualification under Guideline B.\nConsidering first the country involved, South Korea and the U.S. enjoy good foreign relations.\nAlthough South Korea is actively engaged in the collection of U.S. intelligence, there is no evidence\nthat collection activity makes Applicant or his family likely targets for coercion, duress, or influence.\nConsidering Applicant\u2019s circumstances, the government produced no evidence that there was\na heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion because\nof Applicant\u2019s limited family contacts in South Korea. His travel to South Korea raises no\nindependent security concerns, and his contacts with distant relatives there is limited. None of\nApplicant\u2019s close family members have any connection to the South Korean government. Further,\nall his close family members reside in the U.S., and have for over 20 years. Additionally, Applicant\nhimself has been in the U.S. more than 20 years. His wife and children are here. All his financial\ninterests are here. Under these circumstances, I conclude that it is unlikely Applicant can be\npressured based on his family members in or from South Korea. Accordingly, I resolve Guideline\nB for Applicant.\nThe government established a case for disqualification under Guideline E, and Applicant did\nnot mitigate the security concerns. Although Applicant\u2019s travel to South Korea ultimately failed to\n\n\u00b616.(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant and material facts from any personnel\n11\nsecurity questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, . . . [or] determine\nsecurity clearance eligibility or trustworthiness. . .;\n6\nestablish any security concerns, his failure to disclose that travel had the potential to inhibit the\ngovernment\u2019s evaluation of the potential foreign influence concerns. The language of the travel\nquestions is quite clear. Applicant has offered no credible explanation for his failure to disclose that\ninformation. I conclude he deliberately concealed the nature and extent of his foreign travel on his\nclearance applications.  In addition, none of the Guideline E mitigating conditions apply. The\n11\nconcealed information was relevant to a clearance decision. I conclude Guideline E against\nApplicant.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nParagraph 1.

Her financial\nproblems were caused by lost income resulting from her husband\u2019s employment downturn, and\nmedical bills related to her daughter\u2019s serious illness. Since her husband found a steady job in\nNovember 2006, she has made substantial good-faith efforts to rehabilitate her finances. The\nlikelihood of recurrence of her past problems is minimal. Clearance is granted.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn April 11, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued Applicant\na Statement of Reasons (SOR) explaining why it was not clearly consistent with the national interest\nto grant or continue a security clearance. This action was taken under Executive Order 10865, dated\nFebruary 20, 1960, as amended, and DoD Directive 5220.6, dated January 2, 1992, as amended. She\nanswered the SOR on May 11, 2007, admitting the allegations and requesting a hearing. She waived\nher right to 15 days minimum notice of hearing. \nThe case was assigned to me on May 31, 2007. That day, DOHA issued a notice of hearing\nscheduling the hearing for June 12, 2007. During the hearing, I received five government exhibits,\nseven Applicant exhibits, and Applicant\u2019s testimony. At Applicant\u2019s request, I left the record open\nfor her to submit additional exhibits. Within the time allotted, she submitted five additional exhibits\nreceived as H through L. DOHA received the transcript on July 6, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT \nThe SOR admissions are incorporated into the findings of fact. In addition, I make the\nfollowing findings of fact.\nApplicant is a 31-year-old married woman with two children, ages eleven and nine. She has\na high school education. For the past six years she has worked as an accounting clerk for a company\nthat, among other things, provides food services for the armed forces. Specifically, she \u201cis\nresponsible for electronically forwarding dining facility and warehouse orders and receipts  . . . to\n[her company\u2019s] vendors\u201d (Exhibit D, Supervisor\u2019s Reference Letter, dated June 5, 2007). Applicant\nis an exceptional employee who is highly dedicated to her job (see generally, Exhibits D through F,\nSupervisors\u2019 Reference Letters, dated June 5, 2007, June 4, 2007, and June 4, 2007, respectively).\nApplicant\u2019s husband is an Army veteran. When he left active duty in 2001, he had trouble\nfinding a steady civilian job. For the next five years, he experienced frequent periods of layoffs or\nunderemployment. \nThe family began to struggle financially. At or about the same time, one of Applicant\u2019s\nchildren began to experience serious health problems requiring extensive evaluation and treatment.\nUnable to afford health insurance, Applicant fell behind on her debts.\nBy 2005, Applicant had accrued approximately $12,000 of delinquent debt. None of the debts\nwere accrued as the result of frivolous purchases. Approximately $7,900 consist of her daughter\u2019s\n\nSubparagraphs 1.e and 1.h are duplicates.\n1\nSubparagraphs 1.v and 1.r are duplicates.\n2\n3\nmedical bills (subparagraphs 1.f, 1.g, 1.k, 1.o through1. t, and 1.v). The remainder include delinquent\ncar insurance payments (1.a, 1.f, 1.h, and 1.i), several utilities, including cable and television\nservices, (subparagraphs 1.b, 1.c, 1.d, 1.e, 1.h), a deficiency remaining from a repossession (1.u), and\ntwo credit cards (subparagraphs 1.w and 1.x).\nApplicant had a line of credit with a $307 balance that also grew delinquent during this\nperiod (subparagraph 1.n). She paid it in 2003 using her 2002 tax return (Tr. 33).\nBy November 2006, her husband gained a steady, well-paying job, and the family\u2019s financial\nsituation began to improve. In January 2007, she began satisfying subparagraph 1.c, a cell phone\naccount (Exhibit K, Letter from Creditor to Applicant, dated June 13, 2007). She has been making\nsteady payments since that time, and it is no longer delinquent (Tr. 33).\nAt or about the time Applicant began satisfying the cell phone delinquency, she began to pay\none of her delinquent utility bills (subparagraph 1.b). It is no longer delinquent (Exhibit J, Detailed\nStatement History of Utility Company, January 26, 2007 through May 25, 2007).\nIn February 2007, Applicant retained a financial counselor who helped her develop a budget\nand a debt payment plan. Under the plan, Applicant pays the credit counseling company $315 each\nmonth whereupon the company then makes individual payments to each creditor. The plan includes\nthe debts listed in subparagraphs 1.a, 1.d, 1.e,  1.i, 1.r,  1.s through 1.u, 1.w, and 1.x. Applicant has\n1\n2\nbeen making payments since March 2007.\nThe debts listed in subparagraphs 1.f, 1.g, 1.j, 1.k through 1.m, 1.o, 1.p, and 1.q are not\nincluded in the payment plan. With respect to subparagraphs 1.f, 1.g, and 1.o, the government\nalleged the respective amounts of the delinquencies, but did not identify the creditors to whom they\nwere owed. Also, none of the debts not included in the payment plan were listed in the credit report\nthe financial counselor used when she helped Applicant to develop it (Exhibit 2, Credit Bureau\nReport, dated February 20, 2007, as included in Answers to Interrogatories, dated February 22, 2007,\nat 7). Subparagraphs 1.j, 1.l, and 1.m are collectively less than $450. Subparagraphs 1.p, 1.q and 1.k\nare owed to the same medical facility. The financial counseling agency will add any newly\ndiscovered delinquencies to the plan, and adjust the monthly amount due to reflect the additional\nbalance. (Tr. 53).\nApplicant and her husband have maintained health insurance since January 2007 (Tr. 31, 41).\nCurrently, they have approximately $1100 of monthly income remaining after expenses have been\npaid (Tr. 38-39; Exhibit H, Applicant\u2019s Budget, dated June 14, 2007).\nPOLICIES\nThe adjudicative guidelines, as revised December 29, 2005, and implemented September 1,\n2006, apply to the analysis of this case. In addition to brief introductory explanations for each\nguideline, they are divided into those that may be considered in deciding whether to deny or revoke\n\n4\nan individual\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information (disqualifying conditions) and those\nthat may be considered in deciding whether to grant an individual\u2019s eligibility for access to classified\ninformation (mitigating conditions).\nBecause the entire process is a scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person\nconcept,\u201d all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and\nunfavorable, should be considered in making a meaningful decision. Specifically these are: (1) the\nnature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding circumstances; (2) the frequency and recency\nof the conduct; (3) the age of the applicant; (4) the motivation of the applicant, and the extent to\nwhich the conduct was negligent, willful, voluntary, or undertaken with knowledge of the\nconsequences; (5) the absence or presence of rehabilitation; and (6) the probability that the\ncircumstances or conduct will continue or recur in the future.\nThe following adjudicative guideline is raised:\nGuideline F - Financial Considerations: Failure or inability to live within one\u2019s\nmeans, satisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control,\nlack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can\nraise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information.\nConditions pertaining to this adjudicative guideline that could raise a security concern and may be\ndisqualifying, as well as those which could mitigate security concerns, are set forth and discussed\nin the conclusions below.\nSince the protection of national security is the paramount consideration, the final decision\nin each case must be reached by applying the standard that the issuance of the clearance is \u201cclearly\nconsistent with the national interest\u201d (See generally, Directive, Sec. 2.3, Sec. 2.5.3, Sec. 3.2, and Sec.\n4.2). In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are based on the evidence\ncontained in the record.\nThe Government is responsible for presenting evidence to establish facts in the SOR that\nhave been controverted. The applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to rebut, explain,\nextenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by the Government, and has the\nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\nCONCLUSIONS\nApplicant\u2019s history of financial problems triggers the application of Financial Considerations\nDisqualifying Conditions (FC DC) 19(a): inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts, FC DC 19(c):\na history of not meeting financial obligations, and FC DC 19(e): consistent spending beyond one\u2019s\nmeans, which may be indicated by excessive indebtedness, significant negative cash flow, high debt-\nto-income ratio, and/or other financial analysis. \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems began when her husband left the military and experienced\ndifficulties finding steady, well-paying employment. At the same time, one of her children began\nstruggling with a serious health problem that generated costly medical bills which she was unable\n\n5\nto pay, in part, because her husband\u2019s employment problems had rendered her unable to afford health\ninsurance coverage. Financial Considerations Mitigating Condition (FC MC) 20(b): the conditions\nthat resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of\nemployment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce, or\nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances, applies.\nIn January 2007, shortly after her husband gained a good job, they purchased insurance\ncoverage, and began paying their delinquencies. With the help of a financial counselor, Applicant\ndeveloped a payment plan. Several of her delinquencies are consolidated in the plan, and she has\nbeen making payments since March 2007.\nA number of delinquencies were not included in the payment plan. Three of them, however,\nare owed to creditors that the government did not identify in the SOR. The remainder were not listed\nin the credit report the counselor used to develop the plan. Applicant\u2019s credit counselor anticipated\nthat the list of delinquencies that she consolidated into the payment plan may have been incomplete.\nMoreover, Applicant currently has ample after-expense income remaining to incorporate them into\nher payment plan, as the counselor recommended.\nFC MC 20(c): the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or\nthere are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control, and FC MC 20(d):\nthe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts,\napply. Applicant has mitigated the financial considerations security concern.\nWhole Person Concept\nApplicant accrued approximately $12,000 of delinquent debt in four years. This occurred\nbecause of her husband\u2019s employment struggles, and her daughter\u2019s health concerns. Moreover, none\nof the delinquencies constituted frivolous purchases. Her finances improved as her husband\u2019s\nemployment situation stabilized. Since then, she has developed a budget, consulted a counselor, and\nadhered to a payment plan. The income remaining after her debts have been paid renders the\nlikelihood of a recurrence of her financial problems minimal. This evidence of rehabilitation, in\nconjunction with Applicant\u2019s strong character, as demonstrated by her impressive work credentials,\nand the credibility displayed at the hearing, compel me to conclude that her past financial problems\nare no longer a security risk. Clearance is granted.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nParagraph 1 \u2013 Guideline F:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.y:\nFor Applicant\n\n6\nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.

    "summary": "FINDINGS OF FACT The Applicant is 30 years old. He has not completed high school nor does he have a GED.

Howry, Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nSYNOPSIS\nApplicant\u2019s history of criminal conduct has been mitigated by the passage of time, no\nrecurrence of criminal activity, remorse, restitution and a good employment record that shows\nevidence of successful rehabilitation.  His failure to reveal his complete criminal record on his\nsecurity clearance application in response to question 23(f) has not been mitigated by sufficient\nevidence of reform and rehabilitation.  Clearance is denied.\n\n2\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn a date uncertain, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to\nExecutive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2,\n1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant, which detailed reasons why DOHA\ncould not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant and\nrecommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether clearance should be denied\nor revoked.\nThe Applicant responded to the SOR in writing on March 16, 2007, and requested a hearing\nbefore a DOHA Administrative Judge.  The case was originally assigned to another Administrative\nJudge on May 22, 2007.  The case was transferred to the undersigned on June 14, 2007.  A notice\nof hearing was issued on June 6, 2007, scheduling the hearing for June 20, 2007.  At the hearing the\nGovernment called one witness and presented five exhibits.  The Applicant presented three exhibits\nand testified on his own behalf.  The official transcript (Tr.) was received on June 27, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nThe Applicant is 30 years old.  He has not completed high school nor does he have a GED.\nHe is employed by a defense contractor as a Senior Financial Analyst, and is seeking to retain his\nsecurity clearance in connection with his employment.\nThe Government opposes the Applicant's request for a continued security clearance, on the\nbasis of allegations set forth in the Statement of Reasons (SOR).  The following findings of fact are\nentered as to each paragraph and guideline in the SOR:\nParagraph 1 (Guideline J - Criminal Conduct).  The Government alleges that the Applicant is\nineligible for clearance because he has engaged in criminal conduct.\nThe Applicant admitted all of the allegations set forth in the SOR under this guideline.  The\nevidence demonstrates that the Applicant has an extensive past history of criminal conduct beginning\nin 1997 and continuing until at least 2005.  \nIn June 1997, the Applicant was charged with (1) Corporal Injury to Spouse and/or\nRoommate, and (2) Battery.  On October 1, 1997, a warrant was issued for his arrest for failure to\nappear.  He pled guilty and was ordered to pay fines and fees of $235.00 and was required to enroll\nand complete a one year Domestic violence program and perform ten days volunteer work.  (See\nGovernment Exhibits 2 and 5).  \nOn June 10, 1998, a bench warrant was issued against the Applicant for failing to appear and\nfailing to provide proof of progress in the Domestic Violence program.  \nOn January 11, 1999, a bench warrant was issued for failing to appear and/or pay fine or\nprovide proof of volunteer work.\n\n3\nOn May 24, 1999, a bench warrant was issued for failing to provide proof of progress in the\nDomestic Violence program and/or proof of ten days volunteer work.  He was sentenced to 180 days\nin custody with one day suspended. \nOn or about January 19, 2000, a bench warrant was issued for failing to provide proof of his\nprogress in the Domestic Violence program and proof of volunteer work, and the court ordered his\nprobation revoked.  The Applicant admitted to the probation violation, his probation was terminated\nand he was ordered to serve 90 days in custody.  He served eight days in jail and the bench warrant\nwas recalled.\nIn September 1997, the Applicant was arrested and charged with Driving Under the Influence\nof Alcohol.  He was found guilty and ordered to complete public work service and Driving Under\nthe Influence classes, and his driver\u2019s license was suspended.\nIn February 2001, the Applicant was charged with (1) Inflict Corporal Injury to Spouse and/or\nRoommate.  (See Government Exhibits 2 and 5).  \nIn June 2001, the Applicant was charged with (1) Obscene and Threatening Phone Call, (2)\nHarassing by Telephone, and (3) Criminal Threats.  A restraining Order was issued against him in\nNovember 2001, effective for 180 days.  In December 2001, he pled guilty to Count 1 and imposition\nof sentenced was suspended for three years on the condition that he pay $325.00 fine/fees, complete\n10 days of public service and participate in a Domestic Violence Rehabilitation program for 52\nweeks.  In January 2002, his probation was revoked and a bench warrant was issued.  He appeared\nin court and his probation was reinstated with the same terms and conditions.  In April 2002, he\nappeared in court due to his termination from the Domestic Violence program.  His probation was\ncontinued with the same terms and conditions.  In May 2003, the court ordered his probation revoked\nand a bench warrant was issued with bail set at $20,000,00.  In October 2003, he had not complied\nwith the Domestic Violence program, and he was ordered to serve 90 days in the custody of the\nSheriff.  He also failed to provide proof of the remaining six days of public service.  In December\n2004, the Applicant satisfied the courts requirements by providing proof that he attended 52 sessions\nof the Domestic Violence Program. At that time his 90 days in custody was dismissed and his\nprobation was terminated.  (See Government Exhibit 5).    \nParagraph 2 (Guideline E - Personal Conduct).  The Government alleges that the Applicant is\nineligible for clearance because his conduct involves questionable judgment, lack of candor,\ndishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations.\nThe Applicant admitted all of the allegations set forth in the SOR under this guideline, except\n2(h).  From 1998 through 2005, the Applicant was also charged with a number of minor criminal\noffenses.  In September 1998, he was charged with (1) Driving with a Suspended License, and (2)\nInvolved in an Accident/License Suspension based on alcohol conviction.  In February 2001, he was\ncharged with (1) Driving at a Speed with Disregard to Weather and Others, and (2) No Drivers\nLicense.  In August 2001, he was charged with (1) No Front Plates, and (2) Crack in the Windshield,\nand (3) No insurance.  The court imposed a civil assessment of $250.00 against the Applicant.  In\nJanuary 2002, he was charged with (1) Stop Sign Violation, and (2) No Insurance.  The court\nimposed a civil assessment of $678.00 against the Applicant.  In March 2004, he was charged with\n(1) Driving With a Suspended License, and (2) No Insurance.  In August 2005, he was charged with\n\n4\n(1) No Registration.  The court imposed a civil assessment of $501.00 against the Applicant.\n(Government Exhibit 5).    \nOn January 5, 2006, the Applicant completed a security clearance application (SF-86).\nQuestion 23 (f) of the application asked him if in the last 7 years, had he been arrested for, charged\nwith, or convicted of any offenses not listed in response to a, b, c, d, or e, above.  (Leave out traffic\nfines of less than $150.00 unless the violation was alcohol or drug related.); to which the Applicant\nanswered, \u201cNO\u201d.  (See Government Exhibit 1).  This was a false answer.  The Applicant failed to\nlist that he had been arrested, charged and/or convicted as set forth above.  He also failed to list his\ntraffic violations where the fine was more than $150.00.  He explained that at the time he answered\nthe question, he did not recall the dates and times of the offenses.  He did list his DUI in 1997 on the\nfollowing page but did not list the 2001 charge for Obscene and Threatening Phone Calls because\nhe was never arrested for it.  Anything else he thought occurred beyond seven years and that he was\nnot required to list.  Furthermore, he stated that he did not list his civil assessments because he did\nnot acquaint them as fines.  He states that he misinterpreted the question.  He now understands that\n\u201cfull disclosure is better than none\u201d.  (Tr. p. 50).  By failing to list his arrests, charges and\nconvictions, the Applicant violated Federal law, Title 18, United States Code Section 1001, a felony.\nThe Applicant contends that as a result of his tough upbringing he tended to jump the gun\nand had somewhat of a bad temper.  He did things in his past that he regrets and now realizes his\nmany mistakes.  During the periods where he simply did not pay the fines associated with his\noffenses, he had financial hardships and difficulty finding work.  Between 2001 and 2004, he\nbelieves that he made a transformation and really came to terms with who he was and what he\nwanted his life to become.  He is a much different person now than he was even two years ago.  He\nhas now grown up and matured.  He contends that he is highly respected at work and now conducts\nhimself in a responsible manner.  (Tr. p. 39).\nA letter of recommendation submitted on behalf of the Applicant by his direct supervisor,\nindicates that the Applicant is responsible and consistently \u201cmeets\u201d or \u201cexceeds\u201d the customer\u2019s and\nthe Government client\u2019s demanding expectations.  He is highly regarded and trusted by his peers and\npossesses personal integrity of the highest order.  (See Applicant\u2019s Exhibit A).\nA letter from \u201cA Helping Hand\u201d dated August 24, 2004,  indicates that the Applicant has\nattended 37 classes and should complete the program in November 2004.  (See Applicant\u2019s Exhibit\nC).  \nApplicant\u2019s Post-Hearing Exhibit contains several letters of recommendation submitted on\nbehalf of the Applicant by his professional colleagues and associates that attest to the Applicant\u2019s\ntenacious work ethic, good nature, intelligence, responsible and trustworthiness. \nApplicant\u2019s Post-Hearing Exhibit also contains performance appraisals of the Applicant dated\nOctober 19, 2006, and May 31, 2007 that reflect \u201cexcellent\u201d scores in each category.  \nApplicant\u2019s Post-Hearing Exhibit further contains copies of e-mails from the Vice President\nof Finance and a Senior Vice President complimenting the Applicant for his outstanding efforts in\nhis field at work.\n\n5\n     \nApplicant received the Employee of the Quarter Nomination in 2005.  (See Applicant\u2019s Post-\nHearing Exhibit).\nPOLICIES\nEnclosure 2 and Section E.2.2. of the Directive sets forth adjudication policies divided into\n\"Disqualifying Factors\" and \"Mitigating Factors.\"  The following Disqualifying Factors and\nMitigating Factors are found to be applicable in this case:\nGuideline J (Criminal Conduct)\n30.  The Concern.  Criminal activity creates a doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and\ntrustworthiness.  By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply\nwith laws, rules and regulations.\nConditions that could raise a security concern:\n30.(a) a single serious crime or multiple offenses;\n30.(c) allegation or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was\nformally charged, formally prosecuted or convicted;\n30.(e)  violation of parole or probation, or failure to complete a court-mandated rehabilitation\nprogram.\nCondition that could mitigate security concerns:\n30.(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but no limited to the passage\nof time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or restitution, job training or higher\neducation, good employment record, or constructive community involvement.\nGuideline E (Personal Conduct)\n15.  The Concern.  Conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions about an individual\u2019s\nreliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information.  Of special interest is any\nfailure to provide truthful and candid answers during the security clearance process or any other\nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\nConditions that could raise a security concern:\n16.  (a) Deliberate omission, concealment or falsification of relevant facts from any personnel\nsecurity questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations,\n\n6\ndetermine employment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance\neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities.\nConditions that could mitigate security concerns:\nNone.\nIn addition, as set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive at pages 16-17,  in evaluating the\nrelevance of an individual\u2019s conduct, the Administrative Judge should consider the following general\nfactors:\n a.  The nature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding circumstances\nb.  The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation\n \nc.  The frequency and recency of the conduct\nd.  The individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct\ne.  The voluntariness of participation\nf.  The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavior changes\ng.  The motivation for the conduct \nh. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress\ni.  The likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nThe eligibility criteria established in the DoD Directive identify personal characteristics and\nconduct which are reasonably related to the ultimate question, posed in Section 2 of Executive Order\n10865, of whether it is \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d to grant an Applicant\u2019s request\nfor access to classified information.\nThe DoD Directive states, \u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period\nof a person\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the person is an acceptable security risk.\nEligibility for access to classified information is predicted upon the individual meeting these\npersonnel security guidelines.  The adjudicative process is the careful weighing of a number of\nvariables known as the whole person concept.  Available, reliable information about the person, past\nand present, favorable and unfavorable should be considered in reaching a determination.\u201d The\nAdministrative Judge can draw only those inferences or conclusions that have reasonable and logical\nbasis in the evidence of record.  The Judge cannot draw inferences or conclusions based on evidence\nwhich is speculative or conjectural in nature.  Finally, as emphasized by President Eisenhower in\nExecutive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under this order . . . shall be a determination in terms\nof the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the Applicant\nconcerned.\u201d\n\n7\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn the defense industry, the security of classified industrial secrets is entrusted to civilian\nworkers who must be counted upon to safeguard such sensitive information twenty-four hours per\nday, seven days per week.  The Government is therefore appropriately concerned when available\ninformation indicates that an Applicant for clearance may be involved in criminal conduct and\ndishonesty that demonstrates poor judgment or unreliability.\nIt is the Government\u2019s responsibility to present substantial evidence to support the finding\nof a nexus, or rational connection, between the Applicant\u2019s conduct and the continued holding of a\nsecurity clearance.  If such a case has been established, the burden then shifts to the Applicant to go\nforward with evidence in rebuttal, explanation or mitigation, which is sufficient to overcome or\noutweigh the Government\u2019s case.  The Applicant bears the ultimate burden of persuasion in proving\nthat it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him a security clearance.\nIn this case the Government has met its initial burden of proving that the Applicant has\nengaged in criminal conduct (Guideline J), and violations of rules and regulations and dishonesty\n(Guideline E).  This evidence indicates poor judgment, unreliability and untrustworthiness on the\npart of the Applicant.  Because of the scope and nature of the Applicant's conduct, I conclude there\nis a nexus or connection with his security clearance eligibility.\nUnder Guideline J, Criminal Conduct, Disqualifying Condition 30(a) a single serious crime\nor multiple offenses, 30(c) allegation or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the\nperson was formally charged, formally prosecuted or convicted, and 30(e) violation of parole or\nprobation, or failure to complete a court-mandated rehabilitation program apply.  However,\nMitigating Condition 30(d), there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited\nto the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or restitution, job training\nor higher education, good employment record, or constructive community involvement also applies.\nThe Applicant\u2019s extensive criminal history, outlined above, that began in 1997 and continued\nuntil 2004, has been mitigated.  He has obviously matured, satisfied the court requirements\nconcerning each of his past violations and realizes his past mistakes.  His outstanding work record\nand favorable comments from superiors and other professional associates further demonstrates his\nefforts to improve himself and turn from his old ways.  Given the fact that the Applicant\u2019s problems\noccurred a number of years ago, and there is no indication of recent problems, sufficient\nrehabilitation and mitigation has been shown.  Accordingly Guideline J, is found for the Applicant.\nUnder Guideline E, Personal Conduct, Disqualifying Condition 16(a) Deliberate omission,\nconcealment or falsification of relevant facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal\nhistory statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment\nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness,\nor award fiduciary responsibilities applies.  None of the mitigating conditions apply.\nThere is no reasonable excuse for the Applicant\u2019s failure to answer the question 23(f) on his\nsecurity clearance application of January 5, 2006, truthfully.  Consequently, the evidence shows that\nthe Applicant has not been completely honest with the Government and that he sought to conceal\nthe truth.  He was obviously embarrassed by his extensive criminal record and did not want to reveal\n\n8\nit. None of the mitigating factors set forth in the Directive under Guideline E apply.  I find that the\nApplicant deliberately failed to reveal this information to the Government and that he violated Title\n18, United States Code, Section 1001 by doing so.  \nThe Government relies heavily upon the integrity and honesty of clearance holders.  It is a\nnegative factor for security clearance purposes when an Applicant has deliberately provided false\ninformation about material aspects of his personal background.  The Applicant has not provided this\nAdministrative Judge with sufficient evidence in mitigation that would negate the negative impact\nhis falsifications have on his security worthiness.  Although he has made some progress toward\nrehabilitation, he has not demonstrated that he is trustworthy, and does not meet the eligibility\nrequirements for access to classified information.  At this time, I cannot find that it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interests to grant the Applicant a security clearance. \nConsidering all of the evidence, the Applicant has not introduced persuasive evidence in\nrebuttal, explanation or mitigation that is sufficient to overcome the Government's case under\nGuideline E, Personal Conduct, of the SOR. Accordingly, I find against the Applicant under\nGuideline E (Personal Conduct).\nOn balance, it is concluded that the Applicant has failed to overcome the Government's case\nopposing his request for a  security clearance.  Accordingly, the evidence supports a finding against\nthe Applicant as to the factual and conclusionary allegations expressed in subparagraph 2(h) and\nParagraph 2 of the SOR.  Paragraph 1 is are found for the Applicant.  \nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal findings For or Against the Applicant on the allegations in the SOR, as required by\nParagraph 25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive are:\nParagraph 1: For the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.a.:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.b.:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.c.:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara   1.d.: \nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara   1.e.: \nFor the Applicant.\nParagraph 2: Against the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  2.a.:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  2.b.:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  2.c.:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara   2.d.: \nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara   2.e.: \nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara   2.f.: \nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  2.g.:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  2.h.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n\n9\nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant.\nDarlene Lokey Anderson\nAdministrative Judge\n",
