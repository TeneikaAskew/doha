Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn July 13, 2021, the Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency issued to \nApplicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under Guideline F, \nfinancial considerations. The action was taken under Executive Order (EO) 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDepartment of Defense (DOD) Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) effective within the DOD on June 8, 2017. \nOn July 30, 2021, Applicant answered the SOR, and he elected to have his case \ndecided on the written record in lieu of a hearing.

Applicant provided documents that are marked as Applicant\u2019s exhibits (AE) A \nthrough F. There were no objections and they are admitted into evidence. The case was \nassigned to me on October 26, 2021. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant denied the SOR allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.c, and admitted the \nallegation in \u00b6 1.d. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits \nsubmitted, I make the following findings of fact. \nApplicant is 55 years old. He married in 2004 and has four adult children and two \nstepchildren. He earned an Associate\u2019s degree in 1988. He has owned a home since \n1999, and moved to his current home in 2014. He has worked for the same employer \nsince 1995. From 1995 to 2015, he was employed by the corporation. In 2015, the \ncorporation outsourced Applicant\u2019s job, and he was hired by the new contractor and \nremained in the same location. He has held a security clearance since 2008. (Item 3) \nIn October 2020, Applicant completed a security clearance application (SCA). He \ndisclosed a delinquency on his mortgage and no other delinquent debts. He explained \nthat three significant events impacted his finances. When his job was outsourced in 2015, \nhe took a substantial reduction in income. Second, in September 2016, his wife resigned \nfrom her job due to illness. Third, in July 2016, his home was reassessed, which led to a \nsignificant increase in property taxes and his mortgage payment. He subsequently sought \na modification of the mortgage, took a part-time job, and worked overtime. (Item 3) \nApplicant did not disclose the alleged delinquent student loans on his SCA, but he \ndid acknowledge them during his November 2020 background interview. He told the \ngovernment investigator that the student loans were for his son\u2019s college education. He \ncould not provide an explanation for why he fell behind on repaying the loans, but \nacknowledged the debts and intended to look into them and resolve them. (SOR \u00b6 1.a-\n$52,536 and \u00b6 1.b-$36,849). An additional student loan was alleged (SOR \u00b6 1.c-$33,773) \nthat was for his daughter. It does not appear that loan was addressed during his \nbackground interview. (Items 3, 4, 5, 6) \nThe SOR alleges three delinquent student loans that total approximately $123,157 \nand a credit card delinquency of $2,798. In Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he explained \nthe student loans in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b were taken out for his son\u2019s education in August \n2015 and August 2016. The delinquent student loan in SOR \u00b6 1.c was obtained for his \ndaughter\u2019s education in September 2011. (Items 1 and 2) \nIn his answer, Applicant denies his own responsibility for the three student loans. \nThe credit reports reflect the loans as individual accounts in Applicant\u2019s name. Applicant \nindicated in his answer that the loans should be in his children\u2019s names and that his wife \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nhandled most of the financial issues associated with the children\u2019s college applications, \nand he was unaware that he was listed as solely responsible for the loans. He also \nindicated he was unaware the loans were delinquent and did not become aware until he \nwas confronted with them during his background interview. He stated in his SOR answer \nthat he was disputing all three student loans and he will pay them if his dispute is \nunsuccessful. Applicant admitted the credit card debt in SOR \u00b6 1.d. He explained that the \ncreditor for this debt changed its name, and he was unclear as to where to send his \npayments. He attempted to contact the old company and was unsuccessful. He then lost \ntrack of the debt. He said he planned on settling the debt with the creditor. (Items 2, 4, 5, \nand 6) \nIn Applicant\u2019s response to the FORM, he provided two statements (AE B, G). In \nthe first statement (AE G dated September 24, 2021) he said he was disputing the three \nstudent loans on his credit report. He contacted the Department of Education (DOE) and \nwas informed his loans were being handled through a collection agency under contract \nwith DOE. He was provided by DOE, a copy of the original promissory notes and an \napplication for forgery, in the event he believed the signatures were not his. He said he \nmade repayment arrangements with the DOE collection agency pending the resolution of \nhis dispute. Applicant further stated that he intended to assist his children with the student \nloans and said he did not know he was responsible for paying them. Regarding the credit \ncard debt, he provided a copy of a judgment entered against him in January 2021 ($2,925) \nand a copy of a garnishment order from June 2021, requesting a deduction be made from \nhis pay. (AE G, I) \nIn Applicant\u2019s second statement provided in his FORM response, dated October \n8, 2021, he explained various discrepancies indicating the signature of the promissory \nnotes did not belong to him. He stated: \nMy point is; I clearly did not review, fill out, sign, nor provide this information \nfor these applications. Was there verbal consent between my wife and I? \nYes, I\u2019m quite sure but, under the pretense we (my wife and I) would assist \nour children with these loans to help further their education. No details on \nthe loan amounts, whether they were approved, nor when payments were \ndue was shared with me. I did not know I was being held solely responsible \nuntil, this surfaced during my most recent clearance renewal. Again, I am \nnot denying responsibility nor, did I ignore it. This is something I just was \nnot aware of. Regardless, I\u2019m still committed to correcting this debt but, in \nmy opinion it should not be on my record as sole debtor. (AE B) \nApplicant further stated that he decided to forfeit and waive any claim of forgery since he \ndid not wish to discharge the loans. He said he contacted the DOE collection agency to \ninitiate a payment arrangement, but was waiting for his wife to provide her last two pay \nstubs, so an amount could be finalized. He provided no proof that any payments have \nbeen made at this time. (AE B) \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant provided a letter from DOE from September 2021 that states federal \nregulation provides the authority to discharge a borrower\u2019s loan if the borrower\u2019s eligibility \nto receive the loan was falsely certified as a result of the crime of identity theft. (AE E) It \nfurther stated:  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nA borrower is not eligible for loan discharge if it is determined that the \nstudent materially benefited from the proceeds of the loan. A student is \nconsidered to have materially benefitted from the proceeds of the loan if he \nor she attended the school for the period of the loan and incurred a tuition \nliability that was paid in whole or in part by the loan proceeds. (AE E) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set out \nin AG & 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handing and safeguarding classified \ninformation. See ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nAG \u00b6 19 provides conditions that could raise security concerns. The following are \npotentially applicable: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant has three delinquent student loans totaling approximately $123,157 and \na judgment for a delinquent credit card. There is sufficient evidence to support the \napplication of the above disqualifying conditions. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe persons control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \nApplicant\u2019s claim that he was unaware that he was responsible for the student \nloans for his children\u2019s education is disingenuous and not credible. He acknowledged the \nstudent loans when confronted with them during his background interview and indicated \nhe would address them. Applicant said his wife handled the children\u2019s college applications \nand the financial aspects. They had a \u201cverbal\u201d agreement, but \u201cunder a pretense we (my \nwife and I) would assist our children with these loans to help further their education.\u201d That \n\u201cpretense\u201d is not part of a student loan agreement. His failure to read the promissory note \nor make himself aware of his obligations does not bind the DOE to waive Applicant\u2019s \nobligations. His expectation of who would repay the loans within his family is a private \nmatter outside the scope of the loan agreement. Applicant did not provide a statement \nfrom his wife that she misled him, and he is not pursuing identity theft or forgery charges \nagainst her. His children received the proceeds from the student loans and attended \ncollege. Applicant did not provide any information that he made his children aware that \nthey would be responsible for paying the student loans he obtained for them. Regardless, \nhis name is on the promissory notes and he is responsible for paying them. Although he \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nis pursuing payment arrangements with the collection agency, they have not been \nfinalized and he has not made a payment. \nApplicant admitted the delinquent credit card debt. He said that when the creditor \nchanged names, he had difficulty paying it and then he lost focus on the debt. The debt \nwas reduced to a judgment and a garnishment order has been issued. \nAG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply to Applicant\u2019s debts because they are recent and \nongoing. Applicant\u2019s failure to pay the delinquent student loans and credit card were not \nbeyond his control. His failure to read the promissory note and understand that he had \nobligated himself to pay the student loans was within his control. He did not address his \ncredit card debt and it subsequently went to judgment. There is insufficient evidence to \nconclude that Applicant acted responsibly under the circumstances. AG \u00b6 20(b) does not \napply. No evidence was provided to show he has received financial counseling. There is \nsome evidence that Applicant has contacted the collection agency for the student loans \nto make payment arrangements, but that has not been finalized and no payments have \nbeen made to date. In addition, the credit card debt is subject to a garnishment order. \nGarnishment is not considered a good-faith effort to repay a creditor. At this juncture, AG \n\u00b6 20(c) has minimal application, and AG \u00b6 20(d) does not apply. \nApplicant stated he was going to dispute the student loans with the credit bureaus, \nbut then apparently decided not to. His expectation that his children should pay for the \nstudent loans that he obtained for their benefit is a family matter outside the terms of the \nloans. AG \u00b6 20(e) does not apply. \nIt is noted that Applicant\u2019s most recent credit report from March 2021 shows that \nstudent loans are in forbearance as a result of the pause in collection of student loans \nduring the COVID-19 pandemic. While the President\u2019s actions effectively place \nApplicant\u2019s student loans in deferment status, it does not excuse his past inactions in the \ncontext of security clearance eligibility. The loans in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b first became \ndelinquent in February 2018, two years before the COVID-19 deferment. Applicant \nprovided no evidence of steps he took to address the delinquencies prior to then. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline, F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \nApplicant failed to pay student loans he obtained for his children\u2019s education. The \ncreditor for his credit card obtained a judgment and garnishment order. At this time, he \nhas not established a reliable financial track record. He failed to meet his burden of \npersuasion. The record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s \neligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude \nApplicant failed to mitigate the security concerns raised under Guideline F, financial \nconsiderations. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.d: \n \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance.

After a review of the pleadings and evidence, I make the following additional \nfindings of fact. \nApplicant is a 48-year-old employee of a federal contractor performing \nadministrative duties. She began working for a federal contractor in October 2016. She \nhas worked in the medical administration field in some form since she was 16 years old. \nShe is a high school graduate who was taken some college courses.

(Tr. 6, 18, 20, 30; GE 1) \nThe SOR alleged 12 delinquent accounts (two debts arising from repossessed \ncars, a debt from an unexpired lease, and nine medical debts) totaling approximately \n$42,476. The debts are established by credit reports from January 2020, October 2020, \nand July 2022; Applicant\u2019s personal subject interview (PSI) with an investigator in \nFebruary 2020; her June 2020 answers to interrogatories; and her SOR admissions. \n(SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a \u2013 1.l) (GE 2-6; Answer to SOR) \nApplicant\u2019s financial difficulties began in January 2016 when she was terminated \nby her employer. She was told her termination was because of management changes. \nShe was earning approximately $60,000 at the time of her termination. She was given six \nweeks\u2019 severance pay by her former employer. She was unemployed from January 2016 \nuntil October 2016 when she was hired by a federal contractor. When she was hired in \nOctober 2016, her annual salary was approximately $20,000. She voluntarily surrendered \ntwo cars and moved to a cheaper home (described in detail below) to reflect her changed \ncircumstances. (Tr. 20-22) \nApplicant was without health insurance while unemployed and when she became \nreemployed, the health insurance she could afford required payment of high deductibles. \nShe underwent emergency surgery in 2017 when she was uninsured. When her husband \npassed away in 2021, she received the proceeds of two life insurance policies totaling \napproximately $50,000. After funeral expenses she received approximately $37,000. She \nused some of this money to pay her medical debts ($10,000). She also gave some to her \nson ($6,000) and daughter ($2,000), paid cash for a second car ($3,500), put some into \nher savings account ($3,500), helped her mother, and bought things for herself.

This debt resulted from the deficiency balance owed after the \nvoluntary surrender and sale of Applicant\u2019s car. The debt was assigned in September \n2015, it was voluntarily surrendered in 2017, and it was charged off by the creditor in \nMarch 2019. As of the hearing date, Applicant had not made any payment arrangements. \nShe provided a handwritten note on AE A3, indicating that she would begin making $100 \npayments on the 26th  of each month. She documented making one payment in August \n2022. This debt is unresolved. (Tr. 22, 35-36; GE 2-4; AE A2-A3, A6) \nSOR \u00b6 1.b-$10,314.

She documented making one payment \nin August 2022. This debt is unresolved. (Tr. 33; GE 2-4; AE A4-A6) \nSOR \u00b6 1.c-$4,000. Applicant admitted this debt. She incurred this unexpired-lease \ndebt when she vacated an apartment before the lease was up in 2017 because of health \nconcerns. She believed there was mold in the apartment that was affecting her family\u2019s \nhealth. She talked to management about moving to another apartment but nothing else \nwas available. She complained to the building owner but received no relief. She felt she \nhad to break the lease and leave for the safety of her family. She did not pursue legal \naction against the apartment complex. Applicant documented actions she took in August \n2022 to contact the apartment complex to learn the status of this debt. She failed to \npresent documentation supporting her assertion of an inhabitable apartment due to mold. \nThis debt is reflected as a third-party collection in her July 2022 credit report. This debt is \nunresolved. (Tr. 36-38; GE 6; AE A7) \nSOR \u00b6 1.d-$3,259. Applicant admitted this medical debt. She incurred this debt as \na result of 2017 surgery when she was without insurance coverage. She contacted the \ncreditor in June 2020. The creditor told Applicant that the minimum payment plan was \n$50 per month. Applicant could not pay that amount, but sent the creditor a $10 money \norder on June 11, 2020. There is no further evidence of payment until August 11, 2022, \nwhen Applicant documented a $50 payment. She also stated that she would continue $50 \nmonthly payments to this creditor.

(Tr. 38; AE A15; Answer\nto SOR) \n \nApplicant documented paying several other medical debts that were not alleged in \nthe SOR. Those payments efforts will be considered as they might relate to mitigation. \n(GE 3 (pp. 18, 20-21, 25-29, 31); AE A17-19) \nApplicant testified that her annual income is approximately $26,000. She recently \nmoved in with her boyfriend and no longer has housing expenses. She provided a monthly \nfinancial statement in June 2020 that showed a negative cash flow of $120 at the end of \nthe month. She has approximately $3,500 in a savings account. She has not received \nfinancial counseling. (Tr. 24-25, 48) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation about potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nAG \u00b6 18 expresses the security concern for financial considerations: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. I have \nconsidered all of them under AG \u00b619 and the following potentially apply: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant incurred 12 delinquent debts, with the highest-balanced accounts \nremaining unpaid. I find both disqualifying conditions are raised. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. I have considered all of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 \nand the following potentially apply: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and   \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the\npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented\nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions\nto resolve the issue. \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s debts are recent because they are ongoing and, although she paid six \nof the SOR-listed medical debts and some other medical debts, she failed to document \nany payments toward the remaining debts, except for two $100 payments toward the \nrepossessed cars in August 2022. AG \u00b6 20(a) is not applicable. \nApplicant\u2019s unemployment and subsequent pay reduction were circumstances \nbeyond her control. However, she did not act responsibly concerning the debts when she \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nfailed to attempt to resolve them in a timely fashion. Rather than using some of the \nproceeds of her husband\u2019s insurance policies to pay the larger accounts, she used the \nmoney for other things. She used some of the insurance proceeds to pay some medical \ndebts. None of her payments were made in a timely fashion. AG \u00b6 20(b) is not fully \napplicable.  \nApplicant presented no evidence of financial counseling. Moreover, her track \nrecord to date does not support a good financial picture and her financial worksheet \nshows a negative monthly balance. While she paid six medical debts, established a \npayment plan for one other medical debt and made two payments towards the car debts \nin August 2022, she has done very little to resolve her car debts or broken-lease debt. \nHer payment actions are too little, too late. Applicant\u2019s financial problems are not under \ncontrol. AG \u00b6 20(c) does not apply. AG \u00b6 20(d) applies only to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e, 1.f, and 1.i-\n1.l. \nApplicant did not provide written documentation to support her breaking her \napartment lease because of inhabitable conditions. AG \u00b6 20(e) does not apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guideline and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nrelevant facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 \n2(d) were addressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \nI considered Applicant\u2019s necessary medical procedures when she was without \ninsurance, her unemployment, her reduced income when she was reemployed, and her \ncivic contribution to the Girl Scouts program. However, I also considered that she has not \nadequately addressed her large-balanced delinquent debt. She has not established a \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nmeaningful track record of debt management, which causes me to question her ability to \nresolve her debts in the future. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with question and doubts about Applicant\u2019s \neligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude \nApplicant has not mitigated the financial considerations security concerns. I considered \nthe exceptions under Security Executive Agent Directive (SEAD) 4, Appendix C, dated \nJune 8, 2017, and determined they are not applicable in this case. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs: 1.a-1d, 1.g-1.h: Against Applicant \nSubparagraphs: 1.i-1.l: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

When Applicant responded to the SOR (Item 2), he admitted each of the debts, but asserted that he fell for a credit-repair scam. He enrolled in a debt-consolidation program and was told that he would have to allow his accounts to become delinquent for any settlement negotiations.

The \nDCSA CAF explained in the SOR why it was unable to find it clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue security clearance eligibility for him. The DCSA CAF \ntook the action under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information \nwithin Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense (DOD) Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines for \nDetermining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive \nPosition (AG) effective within the DOD on June 8, 2017. \n1 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nOn January 18, 2022, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations. He provided his \ncredit report and requested a decision on the written record in lieu of a hearing before a \nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) administrative judge. On February 17, \n2022, the Government submitted a File of Relevant Material (FORM), consisting of a \nstatement of its position, the pleadings (Items 1 and 2), and three documentary exhibits \n(Items 3 through 5). On March 2, 2022, DOHA forwarded a copy of the FORM to Applicant, \nand instructed him that any response was due within 30 days of receipt. Applicant received \nthe FORM on March 10, 2022. No response was received by the April 9, 2022 deadline. \nOn May 13, 2022, the case was assigned to me to determine whether it is clearly \nconsistent with the interests of national security to grant or continue a security clearance \nfor Applicant. I received the case file on May 23, 2022. \nEvidentiary Rulings \nDepartment Counsel submitted as Item 4 in the FORM a summary report of \npersonal subject interviews (PSI) of Applicant conducted on April 9, 2020, and April 13, \n2020, by an authorized investigator for the Office of Personnel Management (OPM). The \nsummary report was included in a DOD report of investigation (ROI) in Applicant\u2019s case. \nUnder \u00b6 E3.1.20 of the Directive, a DOD personal background ROI may be received in \nevidence and considered with an authenticating witness, provided it is otherwise admissible \nunder the Federal Rules of Evidence. The summary report in this case did not bear the \nauthentication required for admissibility under \u00b6 E3.1.20. \nIn ISCR Case No. 16-03126 decided on January 24, 2018, the DOHA Appeal Board \nheld that it was not error for an administrative judge to admit and consider a summary of a \nPSI where the applicant was placed on notice of his or her opportunity to object to \nconsideration of the summary; the applicant filed no objection to it; and there is no \nindication that the summary contained inaccurate information. In this case, Applicant was \nprovided a copy of the FORM and advised of his opportunity to submit objections or \nmaterial that he wanted the administrative judge to consider. In the FORM, Applicant\u2019s \nattention was directed to the following important notice regarding Item 4: \nThe attached summary of your [PSI] is being provided to the \nAdministrative Judge for consideration as part of the record evidence \nin this case. In your response to this [FORM], you can comment on \nwhether the PSI summary accurately reflects the information you \nprovided to the authorized OPM investigator(s) and you can make any \ncorrections, additions, deletions, and updates necessary to make the \nsummary clear and accurate. Alternatively, you can object on the \nground that the report is unauthenticated by a Government witness and \nthe document may not be considered as evidence. If no objections are \nraised in your response to the FORM, or if you do not respond to the \nFORM, the Administrative Judge may determine that you have waived \nany objections to admissibility of the summary and may consider the \nsummary as evidence in your case. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \nConcerning whether Applicant understood the meaning of authentication or the legal \nconsequences of waiver, Applicant\u2019s pro se status does not confer any due process rights \nor protections beyond those afforded him if he was represented by legal counsel. He was \nadvised in \u00b6 E3.1.4 of the Directive that he may request a hearing. In \u00b6 E3.1.15, he was \nadvised that he is responsible for presenting evidence to rebut, explain, or mitigate facts \nadmitted by him or proven by Department Counsel and that he has the ultimate burden of \npersuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision. While the Directive does not \nspecifically provide for a waiver of the authentication requirement, Applicant was placed on \nsufficient notice of his opportunity to object to the admissibility of the interview summary \nreport, to comment on the interview summary, and to make any corrections, deletions, or \nupdates to the information in the report. Applicant did not object to the FORM or indicate \nthat the PSI summary contained inaccurate information. \nApplicant has his bachelor\u2019s degree. He can reasonably be held to have read the \nPSI summary, and there is no evidence that he failed to understand his obligation to file \nany objections to the summary if he did not want the administrative judge to consider it. \nAccordingly, I find that he waived any objections. Government officials are entitled to a \npresumption of regularity in the discharge of their official responsibilities (See, e.g., ISCR \nCase No. 15-07539 (App. Bd. Oct. 18, 2018)), and there is nothing in the record to doubt \nthe accuracy of the summary. The SOR (Item 1) and Answer (Item 2) are incorporated in \nthe record as the pleadings. Items 3 through 5 are accepted into evidence as \nGovernment\u2019s exhibits, subject to issues of relevance and materiality in light of the entire \nrecord. \nFindings of Fact \nThe SOR (Item 1) alleges under Guideline F that, as of July 26, 2021, Applicant \nowed $19,599 in charged-off debt on ten credit-card accounts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.g, 1.i-1.j, and \n1.l) and $1,105 in collection debt on two accounts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.h and 1.k). When Applicant \nresponded to the SOR (Item 2), he admitted each of the debts, but asserted that he fell for \na credit-repair scam.

In response to an \nSF 86 inquiry concerning any delinquency involving routine accounts, Applicant listed nine \ncharged-off accounts with five different creditors totaling $21,078, including the debts in \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.g, and 1.i. He indicated that his financial issues primarily started around May \n2019, due to increases in his rent, other living expenses, and to \u201csudden large expenses.\u201d \nHe explained that he could not take any actions presently to resolve the debts because of \ninsufficient income and rent and other large expenses taking priority. He asserted that he \nplanned to pay the debts, when [he] secured increased income.\u201d (Item 3.) \nOn April 9, 2020, Applicant was interviewed by an authorized investigator for the \nOPM. He explained that his financial problems began when his monthly rent increased \nfrom $1,150 to $1,270 around May 2019, and he had to choose which bills to pay. His rent \nincreased again, in February 2020, to $1,310 per month. He explained that he tried to \nrepay his debts through a debt-consolidation company that took his money and made his \nsituation worse, so he dis-enrolled from the program and made some payments when he \ncould afford to do so. In addition to the debts disclosed on his SF 86, he discussed credit-\ncard accounts (SOR \u00b6 1.j and 1.i), with respective balances of $642 and $612, and stated \nthat he would make payments on them with his next COVID-relief stimulus check of \n$1,200. He did not plan to repay the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.e because it had been charged off. \nWhen asked about other debts on his credit report (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.g, 1.h, 1.k, and 1.l), he did \nnot dispute them and added that he would pay off the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.h and 1.k within \nthe next six months to one year. He planned in the future to be more financially responsible \nand stated that he would pay off his past-due accounts; impose daily limits on his accounts \nso that he stayed within his income; and use cash rather than credit for purchases. If \ngranted a clearance, he could take the job with the defense contractor, which could \nincrease his annual income by $3,000. (Item 4.) \nApplicant was re-contacted by the investigator on April 13, 2020, for additional \ninformation about his attempted debt repayment through the debt-consolidation process. \nHe gave estimated dates of October 2019 to January 2020 for when he paid into the plan. \nHe acknowledged that his accounts had been in collection before being charged off. He \nstated that he had no intention of repaying those debts that had been charged off. He \nadded that the $1,200 economic stimulus payment was pending deposit to his checking \naccount, and once it cleared, he would make minimum payments to bring some past-due \naccounts up-to-date. (Item 4.) \nA check of Applicant\u2019s credit on March 2, 2021, showed that the accounts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.a-1.g, 1.i-1.j, and 1.l had been opened between May 2015 and December 2018. Some \nreduction in balances was reflected with respect to three accounts: SOR \u00b6 1.h from $1,054 \nto $668 in collection; SOR \u00b6 1.k from $2,413 to $437 in collection; and SOR \u00b6 1.l from \n$795 to $284 charged-off after collection. His credit report showed that he made payments \naccording to terms on other debts: a car loan obtained in November 2015 for $27,870 with \nmonthly payments of $599 for 72 months (balance $8,685); a credit card obtained in \nDecember 2017 with a $900 credit limit (balance $858); two telecommunications accounts \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nopened in January 2019 and July 2020 (balances $175 and $135); and a utility account \nopened in August 2020 (balance $57). (Item 5.) \nAs of January 2022, Applicant was making timely payments of $496 per month on a \nnew car loan obtained in March 2021 for $26,111. He was also making payments \naccording to account terms on $6,501 in outstanding credit-card balances on five accounts \nopened between October 2017 and October 2021. None of the charged-off balances listed \nin the SOR were on his January 2022 credit report. (Item 2.) \nApplicant asserts in mitigation that the debt-consolidation firm told him that his \naccounts would have to be delinquent before the creditors would agree to any settlements, \nand by the time he realized he had fallen for \u201ca shady practice,\u201d he could not undo the \ndamage to his credit. He maintains that had he known the negative impact on his credit, he \nwould not have acquiesced to the debt-relief program. He cited his record of timely \npayments on his open accounts. As for his charged-off delinquencies, he stated, \u201cAt the \ntime of [his] investigation, all delinquent accounts had been charged off by the original \ncreditor.\u201d He expressed regret for trying the debt-relief program but did not indicate that he \nwould attempt to resolve his charged-off debts. (Item 2.) \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion the Executive \nBranch has in regulating access to information pertaining to national security, emphasizing \nthat \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, \nthe administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be considered in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. These guidelines \nare not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, \nthese guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative \nprocess. The administrative judge\u2019s overall adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative \njudge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, \nfavorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence \nto establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant \nis responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation about potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7 of EO 10865 \nprovides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section \n3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concerns about financial considerations are articulated in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness \nto abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or \nsensitive information. Financial distress can also be caused or exacerbated \nby, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other issues of personnel security \nconcern such as excessive gambling, mental health conditions, substance \nmisuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . . \nAn applicant is not required to be debt free, but is required to manage his or her \nfinances in a way as to exhibit sound judgment and responsibility. The Appeal Board \nexplained the scope and rationale for the financial considerations security concern in ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) (citation omitted) as follows: \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money in satisfaction of \nhis or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the totality of an \napplicant\u2019s financial history and circumstances. The Judge must consider \npertinent evidence regarding the applicant\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other \nqualities essential to protecting the national secrets as well as the \nvulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive presumes a \nnexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines and an \napplicant\u2019s security eligibility. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nGuideline F security concerns are established when an individual does not pay \nfinancial obligations according to terms. Applicant admits that he defaulted on the accounts \nin the SOR. As of July 2021, he owed approximately $20,704 in charged-off accounts or \ncollection balances. None of the debts are on Applicant\u2019s current credit report. There is no \nevidence that the creditors are pursuing Applicant for the unpaid balances, most of which \nhas been charged off. While the debts may no longer be a source of financial pressure for \nApplicant, the federal government is still entitled to consider the facts and circumstances \nsurrounding an applicant\u2019s conduct in incurring and failing to satisfy the debts in a timely \nmanner. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-03991 at 2 (App. Bd. Jul. 1, 2015.). The Appeal \nBoard has held that the administrative judge is not precluded from considering whether the \ncircumstances underlying a debt impugn an applicant\u2019s judgment or reliability. See, e.g., \nADP Case No. 14-02206 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 15, 2015). \nApplicant\u2019s record of unresolved delinquency establishes AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), \u201cinability to \nsatisfy debts,\u201d and 19(c), \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d He made some \npayments on three accounts, including the account in SOR \u00b6 1.l where a $284 balance had \nbeen charged off after collection, but made no payments since the SOR was issued. \nHowever, he stated during his PSI that he did not intend to repay the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.e \nbecause it had been charged off. It appears that attitude prevails with respect to his other \ncharged-off balances. AG \u00b6 19(b), \u201cunwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to \ndo so,\u201d is also established. \nThe burden is on Applicant to mitigate the negative implications for his financial \njudgment raised by his delinquent debts. Application of the aforesaid disqualifying \nconditions triggers consideration of the potentially mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20. \nOne or more of the following conditions may apply in whole or in part: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under \nsuch circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem from a \nlegitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit counseling service, \nand there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under \ncontrol; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a), which provides for mitigation of debts that happened \u201cso long ago,\u201d \ncannot reasonably apply. While available credit information does not provide much detail \nafter the delinquency history of the accounts, they were opened between 2015 and 2018 \nand had been charged off or were in collection by February 2021. Applicant indicated that \nhe began having financial issues around May 2019. His delinquencies are considered \nrecent because an applicant\u2019s ongoing, unpaid debts evidence a continuing course of \nconduct. See, e.g., ISCR 17-03146 at 2 (App. Bd. Jul. 31, 2018) (citing, e.g., ISCR Case \nNo. 15-08779 at 3 (App. Bd. Nov. 3, 2017)). \nRegarding AG \u00b6 20(b), Applicant explained during his PSI that he began to struggle \nfinancially due to an increase in his rent in May 2019, which was a circumstance outside of \nhis control. Yet, for AG \u00b6 20(b) to apply in mitigation, Applicant has to demonstrate that he \nacted responsibly under his circumstances to address his debts. While he may have acted \nin good faith on the advice of a debt-consolidation firm to stop paying on his credit-card \naccounts so that the creditors would consider settlements, he dis-enrolled from the debt-\nrelief program in approximately January 2020, after only a few months\u2019 time. He knew or \nshould have known as of his April 2020 PSI, if not as of his March 2020 SF 86, that the \ndelinquent accounts were of concern to the DOD. His credit report shows some reduction \nin the debt balances of three accounts prior to February 2021, but that is not enough in \nmitigation. The Appeal Board has held that an applicant must demonstrate \u201ca plan for debt \npayment, accompanied by concomitant conduct, that is, conduct that evidences a serious \nintent to resolve the debts.\u201d See ADP Case No. 17-00263 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2018), \nciting, e.g., ISCR Case No. 16-03889 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 9, 2018). There is no evidence \nthat Applicant made any attempt to contact his creditors or otherwise take action toward \nresolving or settling most of his delinquent debts. \nNeither AG \u00b6 20(c) nor AG \u00b6 20(d) is established by waiting until past-due balances \nare written off by creditors who may decide not to pursue a debt any longer, or until debts \ndrop from one\u2019s credit record because of the passage of time without activity or other \nreason. Applicant has not made any recent payments on his closed, past-due accounts. \nAlthough his record of timely payments on his open accounts weighs in his favor, it is not \nenough to mitigate his ongoing disregard of the delinquent balances alleged in the SOR. \nNone of the mitigating conditions are fully established. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of his conduct and \nall relevant circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative process factors in AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances \nsurrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the \nfrequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at \nthe time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) \nthe presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral \nchanges; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), \u201c[t]he ultimate determination of whether the granting or continuing \nof national security clearance eligibility is clearly consistent with the interests of national \nsecurity must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful consideration of \nthe [pertinent] guidelines\u201d and the whole-person concept. My comments under Guideline F \nare incorporated in my whole-person analysis. \nThe security clearance adjudication is not a proceeding aimed at collecting an \napplicant\u2019s personal debts. It is a proceeding aimed at evaluating an applicant\u2019s judgment, \nreliability, and trustworthiness with regard to his fitness or suitability to handle classified \ninformation appropriately. See ISCR Case No. 09-02160 (App. Bd. Jun. 21, 2010). It was \nincumbent on Applicant to show that his financial situation is sufficiently stable and not \nlikely to present an ongoing security concern. He indicated on his SF 86 that, in addition to \nthe sudden increase in his rent, he incurred additional unexpected expenses. He did not \nprovide any details about those expenses. He exhibited an unacceptable tendency to act in \nself-interest by continuing to take on new debt, including a $26,111 car loan, while ignoring \nthe debts in the SOR. He presented no employment or character references attesting to his \njudgment and reliability in handling his personal and work affairs that could weigh in his \nfavor under the whole-person concept. It is unclear whether Applicant could be counted on \nto make payments toward his delinquent debts were he to begin working for the defense \ncontractor sponsoring him for clearance eligibility. \nThe Appeal Board has repeatedly held that the government need not wait until an \napplicant mishandles or fails to safeguard classified information before denying or revoking \nsecurity clearance eligibility. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 08-09918 (App. Bd. Oct. 29, 2009, \nciting Adams v. Laird, 420 F 2d 230, 238-239 (D.C. Cir. 1969)). It is well settled that once a \nconcern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility, there is a strong \npresumption against the grant or renewal of a security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, \n913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th Cir. 1990). After applying the disqualifying and mitigating \nconditions to the evidence presented, I conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the \ninterests of national security to grant security clearance eligibility for Applicant. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.l: \nAgainst Applicant \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_______________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant eligibility for a security clearance for \nApplicant.

Or.) \n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960); \nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program, DoD Directive \n5220.6 (January 2, 1992) (Directive); and Security Executive Agent Directive 4, \nestablishing in Appendix A the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines for \nDetermining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to Hold a \nSensitive Position (AGs), effective June 8, 2017. \n1 \n\n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant responded to the SOR on August 17, 2021, and requested a hearing. \nThe case was assigned to me on January 31, 2022, as a case requiring an expedited \nhearing due to the Applicant\u2019s claimed need for a clearance as a condition for \nemployment without any mention of his sponsorship status. (HE 2). A hearing was \nscheduled for the afternoon of March 1, 2022. With sponsorship confirmed by Applicant \nin the morning of the date scheduled for hearing, a hearing was convened. Because \njurisdiction was satisfied by Applicant\u2019s documentation of his employer sponsorship \nprior to convening the hearing, any need to look to Section 4.4 of the DoD Directive for \njurisdictional guidance was negated. (HE 1) \nAt the hearing, the Government\u2019s case consisted of seven exhibits (GEs 1-7) and \nrequests for administrative notice of the countries of Syria and Lebanon. Department \nCounsel\u2019s administrative notice request for Syria covered six documents addressing the \ncountry of Syria; his request for administrative notice request for Lebanon covered ten \ndocuments addressing the country of Lebanon. Administrative notice was taken of \nGovernment source documents covered by each request for administrative notice \nwithout objection, in accordance with Federal Rules of Evidence 201(a). See ISCR \nCase No. 05-11292 at 4 (App. Bd. Apr. 12, 2007); ISCR Case No. 01-26893 at 10 n.2 \n(App. Bd. Oct. 16, 2020). \nAt my request, sua sponte, administrative notice was also taken, without \nobjection, of a U.S. Relations with Syria Bilateral Relations Fact Sheet, U.S. Dept. of \nState (April 2022) and a U.S. Relations with Lebanon Bilateral Fact Sheet, (U.S. Dept. \nof State (April 2022). Applicant relied on 13 exhibits and one witness (himself). The \ntranscript (Tr.) was received on March 11, 2022. \nSummary of Pleadings \nUnder Guideline E, Applicant allegedly (a) was fired from his employment with \nEmployer A in May 2018 for misconduct, and is not eligible for rehire; (b) was fired from \nhis employment with Employer B in January 2017 for numerous translation errors and \nperformance issues, and is not eligible for rehire; (c) was fired from his employment \nwith Employer C in 2011 for misconduct, and is not eligible for rehire; and (d) was \nterminated from his employment with Employer D in March 2009, and is not eligible for \nrehire. \nUnder Guideline B, Applicant allegedly (a) has a brother and four sisters who are \ncitizens and residents of Syria; and (b) has a brother who is a citizen and resident of \nLebanon. Allegedly, the brother referenced as a citizen of Syria and Lebanon is the \nsame brother. \nIn his response to the SOR, Applicant denied each of the Government\u2019s personal \nconduct allegations. He claimed he was responsible for remotely translating information \nfor individuals who were in need of medical information or who had insurance benefit-\nrelated questions. He claimed he never received any advance warnings or reprimands \nfrom any of the employers who terminated his services and never made any translation \nerrors. He denied any misconduct associated with any of his termination notices and \n2 \n\n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nclaimed that the linguist employer covered by SOR \u00b6 1.d rehired him after previously \nlisting him \u201cnot eligible for rehire,\u201d and re-sponsored him for a security clearance, after \nwhich Applicant voluntarily resigned his employment with this employer in 2018 for \npersonal reasons. \nAddressing the Government\u2019s foreign influence concerns, Applicant admitted \neach of the allegations covered by Guideline B with explanations. He claimed he has no \nconflicts (actual or potential) as the result of his brother and sisters being residents of \nSyria, or as the result of his having a brother who is a citizen and resident of both Syria \nand Lebanon. He claimed that he is estranged from his siblings and has had no contact \nwith them in many years, following the passing of his father. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is a 73-year-old civilian sponsored by a defense contractor who seeks \na security clearance. Allegations covered in the SOR and admitted by Applicant are \nincorporated and adopted as relevant and material findings. Additional findings follow. \nBackground \nApplicant married in March 1971 and divorced in December 1974. (GE 1; Tr. \n138) He has one child from this marriage, a son (age 58), who is a U.S. citizen by birth \nwith no known current whereabouts. (GEs 1-2; Tr. 139) Applicant\u2019s first wife was a U.S. \ncitizen, with family members who were all citizens of the United States and fluent in the \nEnglish language exclusively. (Tr. 48) By contrast, none of these family members spoke \nArabic. \nApplicant remarried in December 1998 and divorced in February 2000. (GEs 1-\n2\u2019; Tr. Tr. 138-139) Applicant maintains no contact with this ex-spouse. She resides in \nSyria and never immigrated to the United States. (GE 1; Tr. 138-139) \nApplicant earned a high school diploma from a private high school in Lebanon, \nwhere he became fluent in a Lebanese Arabic dialect that differed somewhat from the \nSyrian dialect he mastered in Syria. (GEs 1-2; Tr. 39-40) During his time in high school, \nhe also mastered his fluency in English. (Tr. 40) Applicant owns no property in Syria or \nLebanon, and has no financial interests (inclusive of inheritance rights, vested or \nexpected) in either country. (Tr. 76-77) By contrast, he has a 401(k) retirement account \nin the United States. \nFollowing his high school graduation in Lebanon, Applicant immigrated to the \nUnited States in June 1970 with a U.S. issued student visa. (GEs 1-7; Tr. 40-41) He has \nalways appreciated the freedoms of choice and tangible benefits that Americans enjoy \nand receive, and he arrived in the United States with a U.S. student visa with his goal of \npursuing advanced educational opportunities. (GE 1; Tr. 41-4, 74-76) Between 1971 \nand April 2015, Applicant attended several U.S. colleges and universities (mostly \nonline), where he took language and grammar classes to enhance his knowledge of the \nEnglish language. (GE 1) Applicant applied for and became a naturalized U.S. citizen in \nMay 1980 with the help of his first wife. (GEs 1 and 6; Tr. 49-51) He reported no Syrian \n3 \n\n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n          Between November 2008 and March 2009, Applicant worked for Company D \n(SOR \u00b6 1.d) as an Arab linguist. (GEs 1-7; Tr. 84-85) The job required his acceptance of \nassignments at dangerous work sites in Iraq, which Applicant declined to accept after \nreceiving inadequate explanations of the job assignments from his employer. (GEs 1-7; \nTr. 92-93 and 159-164) After refusing to accept the site assignments, he was fired in \nMarch 2009 for reasons his employer would not provide, and was told he was not \neligible for rehire. (GEs 1-7; Tr. 92-93,164) Reasons cited by Company D for Applicant\u2019s \nMarch 2009 termination were (a) his refusal to report to an Iraqi air base (for which he \nwas reprimanded) and (b) his subsequent declination to accept his assignment to a \nlocal Iraqi gas station pending further instructions from his employer.

(Tr. 77) However, he is registered with the U.S. Selective Service, and he has \nexercised his right to vote in U.S. elections. (AE L; Tr. 51-52) \nApplicant\u2019s employment history \nBefore immigrating to the United States, Applicant worked numerous temporary \njobs as a translator. (GEs 1-2) These jobs all called for fluency in both English and \nArabic. (Tr. 151-159) Over the course of the ensuing 20 years, Applicant worked for \nprivate translation firms, never spending more than a year in any one job assignment. \n(GEs 1-7; Tr. 151-159) Applicant\u2019s linguist assignments included close working \nrelationships with U.S. mission coordinators throughout the Operation Freedom \ncampaign (2005-2009) in Iraq. (GE 1 and AEs C-D) In none of these linguist \nassignments that involved translating Arabic to English did he encounter any \ndisciplinary problems, cited instances of misbehavior, or criticism over his ability to \ntranslate Arabic to English. (Tr. 54-72). Consistently, he was credited with following the \nlinguist rules and guidelines he was tasked to apply. (Tr. 62-74) \nIn September 2017, Applicant was furnished an exploratory offer letter covering \npotential employment as an Arab linguist by Company D. (AE B) The exploratory offer \nincluded contingencies: language testing, medical and psychological evaluations, \npolygraph screening, and receipt of a security clearance. (AE B) Company D furnished \na follow-up contingency offer to Applicant in February 2018 that included papers for \nApplicant to complete. (GE 1 and AE B; Tr. 94-95) Whether Applicant ever completed \nthe employment papers furnished him by Company D is unclear. \nIn the electronic questionnaires for investigation processing (e-QIP) Applicant \ncompleted in January 2018, he listed Company D as his employer of record since June \n2017. (GE 1) Whether the result of a simple timing mistake or misunderstanding, this \nstart date cannot be reconciled with the September 2017 contingency offer from \nCompany D. Compare GE 1 with AE B. While entries in DOHA\u2019s case tracking system \ncarry a June 2017 Company D sponsorship date for Applicant, they provide no \ninformation as to whether or when he was re-employed by Company D, or when the \ncompany ceased sponsoring him. (H1) All that is known is that Company D notified \n4 \n\n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nDOHA\u2019s tracking system in March 2021 that the company was no longer sponsoring \nApplicant for a security clearance. (H1) \nApplicant\u2019s employment records document his employment with Company C \nbetween April 2011 and July 2011. (GE 7; Tr. 95-104) After completing training with this \nemployer, he was told that he was not a good fit and was terminated without any \ndocumented eligibility for rehire. (GE 7) While he was never told of specific reasons for \nhis termination, misconduct was never cited by the employer as a reason for his \ntermination. (GE 7; Tr., 95-104) \nFor a brief period spanning December 2016 and January 2017, Applicant was \nemployed as an Arab linguist for Company B. (GEs 1-7 and AEs A and J; Tr. 106-107, \n179-183). In January 2017, Applicant was told that a customer complained that a word \nhe translated from Arabic to English, \u201cMuatajaz,\u201d did not represent the translated word \n\u201cdetained\u201d in English that Applicant furnished, and the word as translated by Applicant \nrepresented such a serious interpretation error that it that it could have placed lives at \nrisk. (GEs 3-7 and AE A; Tr. 108) Applicant assured that the term does not have a direct \nEnglish synonym and most closely resembles the English word detained (or against a \nperson\u2019s will). (Tr. 108-110) no reason for firing him for a poor translation. (Tr. 108-114) \nApplicant continues to believe his translation of the word \u201cMuatajaz\u201d was the correct \none. (Tr. 108-114) Even if he was mistaken, a translation mistake was no justifiable \nreason for firing him. \nNo one from Company B ever explained to him what the correct translation word \nwas supposed to be, or how his translation (even if mistaken) could put lives at risk. (Tr. \n110-112) Before receiving his termination letter with no provision for eligibility for rehire \nin March 2017, he was never furnished an explanation from his Company B \nsupervisors. (GE 3 and AE A; Tr. 112-115) \nIn a subsequent letter to Applicant in September 2017, a Company B recruiter \napproached Applicant about bringing Applicant back to the company as an Arab linguist. \n(AE E) Surprised that Company B would consider Applicant for future employment \nopportunities after terminating him and causing his loss of his security clearance and \nother employment opportunities, he paused initially before responding to Company B\u2019s \nletter. (GE 3 and AE G) After giving Company B\u2019s letter some thought, Applicant came \naround to expressing his interest in reuniting with Company B, if such were feasible. \n(AE E) Emails ensued between Applicant and Company B throughout September and \nOctober 2017. (AE E) Ultimately, the company could not find a current fit for Applicant \nwith its current contracts and placed his application on hold for possible future \nemployment. (AE E; Tr. 122-23) \nIn a subsequent letter to Applicant in April 2018, Company B reached out to \nApplicant for a second time to gauge his interest in accepting an Arab linguist \nassignment with the company. (AE F) The company enclosed an application for \nApplicant to complete and reserved any formal job offer pending a background \ninvestigation. (AE F; Tr. 122-123) Media reports confirmed that Company B was later \n5 \n\n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nsued by the U.S. Government for cheating before completing a large settlement with the \nGovernment. (AEs H-I) Rehire offers from Company B never materialized. \nIn May 2018, Applicant was hired by Company A as an Arab linguist. (GEs 1-7) \nThe job lasted less than a month before he was summarily terminated for cited \nmisconduct (interpreted to mean rudeness to a customer in a hospital room who needed \na translation). (GEs 1-7) \nBased on Applicant\u2019s understanding of the May 2018 incident, he simply could \nnot understand the customer in his telephone conversation with her and terminated the \ncall without being rude to her. (GE 2; Tr. 132-35) The company\u2019s stated reason for firing \nApplicant was his reported failure to understand the customer\u2019s request who had \ncommunicated with Applicant from her hospital room. (GE 2; Tr. 132-135) \nFrom past emails furnished by Applicant\u2019s attorneys, his current sponsoring \nemployer (Company E) has not to date added him to its employee payroll. See H1 and \nH2 emails from Applicant\u2019s counsel. Whether and how Applicant was engaged in \nemployment activities between August 2019 and March 1, 2022, and beyond is \nunknown. \n \nApplicant\u2019s family members \nApplicant has a number of family members who are citizens and residents of \nSyria and Lebanon, respectively. (GEs 1-7; Tr. 80-82) While both of his parents are \ndeceased (1987 for his mother and 1988 for his father) (Tr. 77-78), he has four younger \nsisters and a younger brother who are citizens of Syria. (GEs 1-7; Tr. 78-82, 147-148) \nApplicant\u2019s brother is a citizen and resident of Lebanon as well, and is known by \nApplicant to have spent time in both countries. (GEs 1-2; Tr. 80-81) This brother once \nserved in the Syrian Army as a conscripted enlistee. (GE 2) \nApplicant has not maintained any contact with his four sisters residing in Syria in \nover 20 years and has no close relationships with any of the sisters that could bind him \nby affection or obligation. (GEs 1-2; Tr. 81-84, 148-150) While he feels no animosity or \nill will towards any of his sisters, they engage in too much backbiting and gossip to \nmotivate him to engage them in any way.

These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe AGs list guidelines to be considered by judges in the decision-making \nprocess covering DOHA cases. These guidelines take into account factors that could \ncreate a potential conflict of interest for the individual applicant, as well as \nconsiderations that could affect the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified information. These guidelines include conditions that could raise a \nsecurity concern and may be disqualifying (disqualifying conditions), if any, and all of \nthe conditions that could mitigate security concerns, if any. \nThese guidelines must be considered before deciding whether or not a security \nclearance should be granted, continued, or denied. Although, the guidelines do not \nrequire judges to place exclusive reliance on the enumerated disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions in the guidelines in arriving at a decision. \nIn addition to the relevant AGs, judges must take into account the pertinent \nconsiderations for assessing extenuation and mitigation set forth in \u00b6 2(a) of the AGs, \nwhich are intended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and impartial, commonsense \ndecision based on a careful consideration of the pertinent guidelines within the context \nof the whole person.

AG \u00b6 15. \nBurdens of Proof \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation.

The Government has the burden \nof establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d   See v. \nWashington Metro.

The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd.

Additional security concerns \nare raised over a series of terminations (four in all) attributable to cited instances of \nreported misconduct and a lack of demonstrated professionalism. \nForeign influence concerns \nThe status of Applicant\u2019s four sisters and brother as citizens and residents of \nSyria and Lebanon raise serious national security questions about Applicant\u2019s being \nplaced in a position in which he could be manipulated, pressured, or coerced by Iraqi \nmilitary and terrorist organizations operating in Ira. These concerns present heightened \nsecurity risks covered by two disqualifying conditions. (DC) \u00b6 7(a) of the AGs for foreign \ninfluence: \u201ccontact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business or \nprofessional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a foreign \ncountry if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, \nmanipulation, pressure, or coercion\u201d; and DC \u00b6 7(b), \u201cconnections to a foreign person, \ngroup, government, or country that create a potential conflict of interest between the \nindividual\u2019s obligation to protect classified or sensitive information or technology and the \nindividual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing that \ninformation or technology,\u201d apply to Applicant\u2019s situation. \nGenerally, the AGs governing collateral clearances do not dictate per se results \nor mandate particular outcomes for applicants with relationships and contacts with \n13 \n\n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \npersons who are citizens and residents of foreign countries in general.

See ISCR Case No. 06-24575 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 9, 2007) \nSummarized, the AGs do take into account the country\u2019s demonstrated relations \nwith the United States as an important consideration in gauging whether the particular \nrelative, friend, or contact with citizenship and residency elsewhere, create a heightened \nsecurity risk. Syria and Lebanon are countries occupied by terrorist organizations and is \nconsidered a country with a poor human rights record and ones that are unsafe for \ntravel by U.S. citizens despite the countries\u2019 having generally positive bilateral relations \nwith the United States. \nAppeal Board precedents hold that there is a rebuttable presumption that a \nperson has ties of affection for, or obligation to, his or her own immediate family \nmembers as well as to those of his or her spouse. ISCR Case No. 17-04208 at 4 (App. \nBd. Aug. 7, 2019); ISCR Case no. 12-00084 at 2 (App. Bd. May 22, 2014); ISCR Case \nNo. 10-09986 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 15 2011). Infrequency of contact with the family \nmember (as is the case with Applicant\u2019s siblings) is not necessarily enough to rebut the \npresumption an applicant has ties of affection for, or obligation to, his or her own \nimmediate family, as well as his or her spouse\u2019s family. See ISCR Case No. 17-01979 \nat 4 (App. Bd. July 31, 2019). \nIn Applicant\u2019s case, he has convincingly rebutted any presumption of affection or \nobligation that could or might exist between himself and his siblings residing in Syria \nand Lebanon, respectively. Whatever bonds of affection or obligation previously existed, \nor may have existed during Applicant\u2019s childhood and adolescent years have long since \nbeen extinguished. Since the early 2000s, Applicant has had no contact with or interest \nin any of these siblings. Based on the information supplied in this evidentiary record, \nApplicant has persuasively demonstrated that he has no personal relationships with any \nof his siblings in Syria in Lebanon that could place Applicant or any of his siblings at risk \nto coercion, pressure, or influence from Syrian or Lebanese military or government \nofficials. \nMitigating conditions (MCs) available to Applicant are as follows: MC \u00b6\u00b6 8(a), \u201cthe \nnature of the relationships with foreign persons are located , or the positions or activities \nof those persons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in \na position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, group, \norganization, or government and the interests of the United States\u201d; 8(b), \u201c there is no \nconflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of loyalty or obligation to the \nforeign person, or allegiance to the group, government, or country is so minimal, or the \nindividual has such deep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in the United \nStates, that the individual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of \nth government\u201d; and 8(c), \u201c contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual \nand infrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign influence \nor exploitation.\u201d See ISCR Case No. 06-24575, supra. \n14 \n\n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSo, although, infrequency of contact with family members residing in high risk \ncountries may not be enough by itself to rebut the presumption an Applicant has ties of \naffection for, or obligation to, his immediate family members residing in a heightened \nrisk country, the proven absence of any ties of affection, or obligation to, any of his \nsiblings in Syria and Lebanon (as here) is enough to rebut any presumption of affection, \nor obligation to the siblings. See ISCR Case No. 17-01979 at 4 (App. Bd. July 31, \n2019). \nPersonal conduct concerns \nSecurity concerns are raised as well over Applicant\u2019s severed employment \nrelationships over a 10-year span. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.d) Each of the cited employment \nrelationships resulted in involuntary terminations following brief periods of employment. \nCited reasons for the terminations were misconduct, translation errors, and declinations \nto accept assignments at identified dangerous sites in Iraq. In each instance, Applicant \nwas determined to be ineligible for rehire. \nFor sure, the Government has the right to require those who have access to \nclassified information to adhere to core tenets of trust, reliability, and good judgment. \nSee Snepp v. United States, 444 U.S. 507, 511n.6 (1980) Serious infractions by an \napplicant with access to classified information raise security concerns over an \napplicant\u2019s willingness to comply with rules and regulations. See ISCR Case No. 14-\n03701, at 3-4 (App. Bd. April 12, 2017). In cases of cited serious misconduct even \nfavorable opinions of supervisors (past and present) and coworkers may not be enough \nto surmount findings of serious Applicant misconduct. See id.  \nNothing in this case, however, reveals any acts of dishonesty, misconduct, or \nmeretricious behavior on the part of Applicant. None of the cited instances of \nmisconduct and a lack of professionalism reflect any breaches of trust and reliability, or \neven displays of poor judgment. Each of the terminations of employment relationships \nApplicant incurred with his SOR-covered employers involved either refusals to accept \nperceived dangerous assignments, disputes over translations, communication \nmisunderstandings, and in some instances poor fits. Allegations of misconduct and the \nlack of professionalism are unsubstantiated. \nWhole-person assessment \nWhole-person \nassessment \nof \nApplicant\u2019s \nclearance \neligibility \nrequires \nconsideration of whether his siblings who are citizens and residents of Syria and \nLebanon, respectively, are free from heightened risks of coercion, pressure, and \ninfluence from exploitation by military and terrorist organizations operating in Syria and \nLebanon, consistent with safeguarding U.S. security interests. Additional security \nconcerns are associated with Applicant\u2019s cited instances of misconduct and lack of \nprofessionalism. \nTaking into account Applicant\u2019s past contributions to the U.S. defense mission as \na linguist in Iraq (2005-2009) supporting Iraq coalition forces, and the absence of any \n15 \n\n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n        \n \n  \n        \nclose family relationships in either Syria or Lebanon, any heightened risks associated \nwith these family members are minimal at best. Applicant\u2019s cited acts of misconduct are \nunsubstantiated and do not reflect any lapses in candor, misconduct, or \nprofessionalism. \nI have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518 (1988), Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, and the AGs, to the facts and \ncircumstances in the context of the whole person.

On December 20, 2021, Applicant agreed to a \nhearing date of January 25, 2022. (HE 1) On January 10, 2022, the Defense Office of \nHearings and Appeals issued a Notice confirming the hearing date of January 25, 2022. \n(Id.) His hearing was held as scheduled in the vicinity of Arlington, Virginia using the DOD \nMicrosoft Teams video teleconference system. (Id.) \nDuring the hearing, Department Counsel offered four exhibits, which were admitted \nwithout objection. (Tr. 27-28; Government Exhibits (GE) 1-GE 4) Applicant did not offer \nany documents at his hearing. (Tr. 18-19) On February 4, 2022, DOHA received a \ntranscript of the hearing. Four documents were received after Applicant\u2019s hearing, and \nthey were admitted into evidence without objection. (Applicant Exhibit (AE) A-AE D) The \nrecord closed on February 22, 2022. (Tr. 76, 81) Applicant mentioned during his hearing \nthat he intended to submit Power Point slides; however, after his hearing he indicated he \ncould not locate them. (AE E) He covered the content of the slides during his statement \nat his hearing. \nSome details were excluded to protect Applicant\u2019s right to privacy. Specific \ninformation is available in the cited exhibits and transcript.  \nFindings of Fact \nIn Applicant\u2019s SOR response, he admitted parts of the SOR allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a \nthrough 1.c, and he denied other parts of the SOR allegations. (HE 3) He also provided \nmitigating information. (Id.) His admissions are accepted as findings of fact. Additional \nfindings follow. \nApplicant is 37-year-old senior logistician. (Tr. 6; GE 1) In 2006, he received a \nbachelor\u2019s degree with a major in political science, and in 2013, he was awarded a \nmaster\u2019s degree in data and supply chain management. (Tr. 7; GE 1) He served on active \nduty for nine years in the Marine Corps, and then continued in the Marine Corps Reserve. \n(Tr. 7-8) He is currently a major. (Tr. 8, 34) In 2006, he married, and his four children are \nages six, seven, eight, and ten. (Tr. 8-9) \nFinancial Considerations \nApplicant\u2019s current annual salary is $135,000, and his spouse\u2019s annual salary is \n$155,000. (Tr. 55) He has an additional annual income of about $20,000 from other \nsources. (Tr. 55-56) He has substantial funds in the bank. (Tr. 56; AE C) From 2016 to \n2022, Applicant and his spouse\u2019s gross annual income averaged from $250,000 to \n$300,000. (Tr. 68) He estimated his net worth to be about $650,000. (Tr. 69) His net \nmonthly remainder is about $8,000. (Tr. 57) Several years ago, Applicant spent $42,000 \nin medical and legal expenses to adopt a child. (Tr. 25) The adoption expenses reduced \nApplicant\u2019s available funds. Applicant\u2019s spouse is a physician\u2019s assistant.

(Tr. 36-37) Around 2014 to 2015, he spent about \n$180,000 to expand the house from 1,400 square feet to 3,500 square feet. (Tr. 16, 21, \n25, 36, 38) He contracted with a construction company (CC) and agreed to pay $119,495 \nto CC to remodel his residence. (Tr. 38, 41) He had $80,000 cash, and he borrowed the \nremainder on credit cards. \nApplicant paid the final payment to the CC before the work was completed, and \nthen CC left without completion of the work. (Tr. 16, 41) CC closed their company, and \nApplicant was unable to recover the funds paid to CC to complete the contract. (Tr. 16, \n26, 42) He acknowledged he made a poor decision to pay CC before the work was \ncompleted. (Tr. 41) He paid other construction companies or individuals $57,000 to \ncomplete the construction. (Tr. 17, 26) Completion of construction was necessary to \nenable Applicant\u2019s family to live in the residence. (Tr. 17-18) \nApplicant was unsuccessful in getting an insurance company to pay to complete \nthe construction or to recover the funds paid to CC. (Tr. 26, 42-43) He did not provide \ndetails about why his insurance policy might pay for his losses. Applicant was unsure \nabout why he did not sue CC; however, it may have been an inability to collect from CC \nand a reluctance to pay litigation costs when CC might not pay any judgment obtained \nfrom a court. (Tr. 59) In 2021, Applicant sold the house and made a $130,000 profit after \nthe mortgage was paid. (Tr. 33) \nThe SOR alleged Applicant has three charged-off debts totaling $44,471 as \nfollows: SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a ($3,136), 1.b ($21,335), and 1.c ($20,000). \nIn October 2015, Applicant hired a debt reduction company (DRC) to help resolve \nfive delinquent debts. (AE A) He paid DRC $580 monthly. (Tr. 52) The debt in SOR \u00b6 1.a \noriginated from a store charge card, and the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.b originated from a financial \ncredit card. (Tr. 46, 49) DRC wrote the creditors in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b; however, DRC \nsaid the creditors \u201cdid not respond and chose not to pursue the accounts so now the \nstatute of limitations has expired, and they cannot legally collect these debts. We will now \nbe challenging the accounts on the credit report to be removed.\u201d (Tr. 46; AE A) DRC \nadvised Applicant not to pay the creditors in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b. (Tr. 49) \nApplicant did not provide the correspondence DRC sent to the creditors in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.a and 1.b. He did not receive an IRS Form 1099-C (cancellation of indebtedness) from \nthe creditors in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b. (Tr. 47) He never made an offer to settle the debt in \nSOR \u00b6 1.b because DRC was handling the settlement negotiations. (Tr. 61-62) Applicant \ndid not indicate that DRC ever offered a specific settlement amount to the creditors in \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b. (Tr. 63-64) He had the funds available to pay the debt owed to SOR \n\u00b6 1.b in full if he chose to do so. (Tr. 69-70) Applicant provided a February 17, 2022 \nTransUnion credit report which did not include the delinquent debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and \n3 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n1.b; however, his December 7, 2021 Equifax credit report lists the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.b, but \nnot the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.a. (GE 4 at 5, AE B) \nApplicant said the three-year statute of limitations barred collection of the debts in \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b, and he believed the debt was \u201cno longer valid.\u201d (Tr. 32-33) The \nstatute of limitations for a credit card debt in the state where his residence was located in \n2015 and 2016 is five years. Applicant did not indicate the state with the three-year statute \nof limitations or provide information about why that state would have jurisdiction over his \ndebts. \nDRC said the creditor in SOR \u00b6 1.c \u201cchose not to respond and then charged off the \naccount and did not pursue it despite our attempts and it is now past the statute of \nlimitations and cannot legally be enforced.\u201d (Id.) In 2015, the creditor in SOR \u00b6 1.c issued \nan IRS Form 1099-C indicating the creditor cancelled a debt owed by Applicant for \n$18,093. (SOR response at 7) Applicant said the debt was \u201cpaid off in full per negotiated \nsettlement amount.\u201d (SOR response at 3) Actually, he paid the settlement amount, and \ndeclared the $18,093 as income on his federal income tax return. (Tr. 61) \nApplicant explained that he did not pay the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, and 1.c \nbecause CC should have repaid the funds Applicant borrowed and paid to CC to complete \nwork that was not performed. (Tr. 53) Applicant wanted DRC to convince some of his \ncreditors to seek repayment from CC rather than from him. (Tr. 44) He was \u201cunder the \nimpression\u201d from DRC that the creditors could seek repayment from CC and when the \ncreditors elected not to do so, Applicant elected not to repay the creditors in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a \nand 1.b. (Tr. 54) \nApplicant said he paid the debts he believed to be legitimate, and he did not pay \nthe debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b because he questioned their validity. (Tr. 60) Applicant \nconceded that the lack of privity made enforcement by the creditors unlikely, that is, the \ncontract between Applicant and CC is only binding on Applicant and CC (the actual parties \nto the contract), and creditors did not have a contractual basis to enforce the contract. \n(Tr. 65-66) \nTwo non-SOR creditors responded to DRC\u2019s request for information, and DRC \nsettled both debts on Applicant\u2019s behalf. (AE A) Applicant established payment plans for \nsome of his other debts. (Tr. 45-46) One non-SOR creditor obtained a judgment against \nApplicant for $9,822. (Tr. 61) Applicant made $2,000 monthly payments required by the \njudgment, and he resolved the debt. (Tr. 61) \nAside from the two debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b, Applicant has excellent credit. \n(Tr. 75; AE B) As to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b, he relied on the DRC\u2019s advice, which was to \nallow DRC to negotiate settlement of his debts.

Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The President \nhas authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicant\u2019s eligibility for \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Clearance \ndecisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \nThus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that it is based, in whole or \nin part, on any express or implied determination about applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or \npatriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the \nPresident, Secretary of Defense, and Director of National Intelligence have established \nfor issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 \n(App. Bd. May 2, 1996). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \n5 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nfacts.

Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).  \nAnalysis \nFinancial Considerations \nAG \u00b6 18 articulates the security concern for financial problems: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nThe Appeal Board explained the scope and rationale for the financial \nconsiderations security concern in ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) \n(citation omitted) as follows: \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might \nknowingly compromise classified information in order to raise money in \nsatisfaction of his or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the \ntotality of an applicant\u2019s financial history and circumstances. The Judge \nmust consider pertinent evidence regarding the applicant\u2019s self-control, \njudgment, and other qualities essential to protecting the national secrets as \nwell as the vulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive \npresumes a nexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines \nand an applicant\u2019s security eligibility. \nAG \u00b6 19 includes disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern and \nmay be disqualifying in this case: \u201c(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the \nability to do so\u201d; and \u201c(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d \nIn ISCR Case No. 08-12184 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan. 7, 2010), the Appeal Board \nexplained: \nIt is well-settled that adverse information from a credit report can normally \nmeet the substantial evidence standard and the government\u2019s obligations \n6 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nunder [Directive] \u00b6 E3.1.14 for pertinent allegations.

The record establishes the disqualifying conditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n19(a) and 19(c), requiring additional inquiry about the possible applicability of mitigating \nconditions. Discussion of the disqualifying conditions is contained in the mitigation \nsection, infra. \nThe financial considerations mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are as follows: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and  \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \n \nIn ISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013), the DOHA Appeal \nBoard explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for proving the applicability of mitigating \nconditions as follows:  \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of \na security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government \npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the \napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The \nstandard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in \nEgan, supra. \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access \n7 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nto classified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nDirective, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 2(b). \nApplicant described two circumstances beyond his control, which adversely \naffected his finances. He and his spouse adopted a child and spent $42,000 in medical \nand legal expenses. He was the victim of an unscrupulous construction company (CC) \nwhen his home was under construction, which cost about $57,000 to remedy.  However, \n\u201c[e]ven if Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to \ncircumstances outside his control, the Judge could still consider whether Applicant has \nsince acted in a reasonable manner when dealing with those financial difficulties.\u201d ISCR \nCase No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. Bd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 03-13096 at \n4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005); ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR \nCase No. 99-0012 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999)). Applicant did not file a lawsuit against \nCC. Applicant did not establish privity between CC and the creditors in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and \n1.b. His dispute with CC does not provide a reasonable reason for him not to pay his debt \nowed to the creditors in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b.   \nAnother component under AG \u00b6 20(a) is whether Applicant maintained contact with \ncreditors and attempted to negotiate partial payments to keep debts current. Applicant \ndid not provide supporting documentary evidence that he maintained contact with the \ncreditors in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b. He did not provide the letters that DRC sent to the \ncreditors. He did not provide any evidence of any payments or settlement offers sent to \nthese two SOR creditors after 2015. For example, if a debtor knows a valid debt is owed \nto a creditor, it does not show good faith to write the creditor, ask for a copy of the contract, \nand then refuse to pay the debt until the creditor provides a copy of the contract. A creditor \nmust provide a copy of the contract to enforce a debt in court; however, in security \nclearance cases, the Applicant has the burden of providing proof a debt is invalid once it \nappears on their credit report. \nApplicant\u2019s debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b do not appear on his February 17, 2022 \nTransUnion credit report. These two debts may have been dropped from his credit report. \n\u201c[T]hat some debts have dropped off his [or her] credit report is not meaningful evidence \nof debt resolution.\u201d ISCR Case No. 14-05803 at 3 (App. Bd. July 7, 2016) (citing ISCR \nCase No. 14-03612 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 25, 2015)). The Fair Credit Reporting Act requires \nremoval of most negative financial items from a credit report seven years from the first \ndate of delinquency or the debt becoming collection barred because of a state statute of \nlimitations, whichever is longer. See Title 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681c. See Federal Trade \nCommission website, Summary of Fair Credit Reporting Act Updates at Section 605, \nhttps://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/pdf-0111-fair-credit-reporting-act.pdf. Debts may \nbe dropped from a credit report upon dispute when creditors believe the debt is not going \nto be paid, a creditor fails to timely respond to a credit reporting company\u2019s request for \ninformation, or when the debt has been charged off. \nDRC provided reasonable financial advice to Applicant about state statutes of \nlimitations. State statutes of limitations for various types of debts range from 2 to 15 years. \nSee Nolo Law for All website, Chart: Statutes of Limitations in All 50 States, \nhttp://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/statute-of-limitations-state-laws-chart-29941. \n8 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nhtml. According to the Federal Trade Commission, Consumer Information webpage, it is \nillegal under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act for a creditor to threaten to sue to \ncollect a time-barred debt. http://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/0117-time-barred-debts. \nThe South Carolina Court of Appeals succinctly explained the societal and judicial value \nof application of the statute of limitations: \nStatutes of limitations embody important public policy considerations in that \nthey stimulate activity, punish negligence and promote repose by giving \nsecurity and stability to human affairs. The cornerstone policy consideration \nunderlying statutes of limitations is the laudable goal of law to promote and \nachieve finality in litigation. Significantly, statutes of limitations provide \npotential defendants with certainty that after a set period of time, they will \nnot be [haled] into court to defend time-barred claims. Moreover, limitations \nperiods discourage plaintiffs from sitting on their rights. Statutes of \nlimitations are, indeed, fundamental to our judicial system. \nCarolina Marine Handling, Inc. v. Lasch, 363 S.C. 169, 175-76, 609 S.E.2d 548, 552 (S.C. \nCt. App. 2005) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). South Carolina case law \nis not binding on state courts in other states. However, the South Carolina Court of \nAppeals\u2019 description of the basis for this long-standing legal doctrine is instructive. See \nalso Tulsa Professional Collection Services, Inc. v. Pope, 485 U.S. 478, 486 (1988) \n(where the U.S. Supreme Court noted that \u201cThe State\u2019s interest in a self-executing statute \nof limitations is in providing repose for potential defendants and in avoiding stale claims.\u201d). \nDRC said the state statute of limitations was three years; however, the home under \nconstruction was in a state with a statute of limitations for credit card debt of five years. \nSee Credit.Com website, \nhttps://www.credit.com/debt/statutes-of-limitations/. Once \nApplicant stopped making payments, the creditor had to file suit within the statute of \nlimitations to maintain the collectability of their debt. There is no evidence that the \ncreditors in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b took judicial action in court to pursue collection of these \ntwo debts. Assuming Applicant\u2019s debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b are collection barred, they \nare still relevant to financial considerations security concerns: \nApplicant\u2019s argument concerning the unenforceability of the largest debt \ndue to the running of the statute of limitations fails to demonstrate the Judge \nerred. First, security clearance decisions are not controlled or limited by \nstatutes of limitations. Second, absent an explicit act of Congress to the \ncontrary, the Federal Government is not bound by state law in carrying out \nits functions and responsibilities. Applicant does not cite to any Federal \nstatute that requires the Federal Government to be bound by state law in \nmaking security clearance decisions. Third, a security clearance \nadjudication is not a proceeding aimed at collecting an applicant\u2019s personal \ndebts. Rather, it is a proceeding aimed at evaluating an applicant\u2019s \njudgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. Accordingly, even if a delinquent \ndebt is legally unenforceable under state law, has been discharged in a \nbankruptcy, or is paid, the Federal Government is entitled to consider the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding an applicant\u2019s conduct in incurring and \n9 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n     \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nfailing to satisfy the debt in a timely manner.

In this case, the Judge\u2019s consideration \nof the unenforceable debt in making her security clearance eligibility \ndetermination was not arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. \n \nISCR Case No. 15-02326 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 14, 2014).  The Appeal Board has \u201cheld that \nreliance on a state\u2019s statute of limitations does not constitute a good-faith effort to resolve \nfinancial difficulties and is of limited mitigative value.\u201d ISCR Case No. 15-01208 at 3 (App. \nBd. Aug. 26, 2016) (citing ADP Case No. 06-18900 at 5 (App. Bd. Jun. 6, 2008); ISCR \nCase No. 03-04779 at 4 (App. Bd. Jul. 20, 2005); ISCR Case No. 01-09691 at 2-3 (App. \nBd. Mar. 27, 2003)). See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 08-01122 (App. Bd. Feb. 9, 2009) \n(reversing grant of security clearance); ADP Case No. 06-14616 (App. Bd. Oct. 18, 2007)  \n(reversing grant of security clearance and stating \u201creliance upon legal defenses such as \nthe statute of limitations does not necessarily demonstrate prudence, honesty, and \nreliability; therefore, such reliance is of diminished probative value in resolving \ntrustworthiness concerns arising out of financial problems\u201d (citing ISCR Case No. 03-\n20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006)). \nApplicant did not describe any financial counseling. Applicant had ample financial \nresources over the last five years to resolve the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b. There is no \nclear evidence that these two debts are being resolved. I have assumed that Applicant \ncould not be held financially responsible for the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b because of \nthe statute of limitations. However, he did not provide sufficient documentation about why \nhe was unable to make greater documented progress resolving these two debts. He did \nnot show that the creditors would refuse payment notwithstanding the statute of \nlimitations. There is insufficient assurance that this financial problem is being resolved. \nUnder all the circumstances, he failed to establish mitigation of financial considerations \nsecurity concerns. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), \u201c[t]he ultimate determination\u201d of whether to grant a security \nclearance \u201cmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \n10 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \nof the guidelines\u201d and the whole-person concept. My comments under Guideline F are \nincorporated in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that guideline but some warrant additional comment. \nApplicant is 37-year-old senior logistician. In 2006, he received a bachelor\u2019s \ndegree with a major in political science, and in 2013, he was awarded a master\u2019s degree \nin data and supply chain management. He served on active duty for nine years in the \nMarine Corps, and then continued in the Marine Corps Reserve. He is currently a major. \nHe is clearly intelligent and has greater than average financial acumen. \nApplicant provided important financial mitigating information. His finances were \nharmed by several circumstances beyond her control. All of his debts are current, except \nfor the debt in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b. He and his spouse have ample income to pay their \ndebts and maintain their financial responsibilities. \nThe evidence against grant of a security clearance is more substantial at this time. \nApplicant did not provide documentation about why he was unable to make greater \ndocumented progress resolving the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b. Applicant did not \nprovide a persuasive reason why he did not make specific and reasonable offers to settle \nthe two debts. His lack of responsible financial action in regard to the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.a and 1.b over the last seven years raises unmitigated questions about his reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information. See AG \u00b6 18.  \nIt is well settled that once a concern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s security \nclearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption against granting a security clearance. \nSee Dorfmont, 913 F. 2d at 1401. \u201c[A] favorable clearance decision means that the record \ndiscloses no basis for doubt about an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation.\u201d ISCR Case No. 18-02085 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan. 3, 2020) (citing ISCR Case \nNo.12-00270 at 3 (App. Bd. Jan. 17, 2014)). \nThis decision should not be construed as a determination that Applicant cannot or \nwill not attain the state of reform necessary for award of a security clearance in the future. \nWith more effort towards documented resolution of his past-due debt, and a better track \nrecord of behavior consistent with his obligations, he may well be able to demonstrate \npersuasive evidence of his security clearance worthiness. \nI have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Egan, Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, \nthe AGs, and the Appeal Board\u2019s jurisprudence to the facts and circumstances in the \ncontext of the whole person. Applicant failed to mitigate financial considerations security \nconcerns. \n11 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_________________________ \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT  \nSubparagraphs 1.a and 1.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.c: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances in this case, it is not clearly consistent with the \ninterests of national security to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance.

After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant is 54 years old. He was married from 1987 to 1989 and from 1990 to February 2020. He has four adult children. In his government interrogatories he stated he began working for a federal contractor in August 2020. (Items 3, 4) In Applicant\u2019s July 2020 security clearance application (SCA), he disclosed he failed to timely file his 2017 and 2018 federal income tax returns. He attributed this to his ex-wife\u2019s failure to timely file the returns when he was working overseas in 2017 and 2018. He estimated he owed $40 for each tax year and his accountant was making payment arrangements with the IRS. He also attributed his other financial problems to his ex-wife who did not pay the bills while he was overseas and instead was using their money for other purposes. They are now divorced. (Items 2, 3) The SOR alleges that Applicant is indebted to the federal government for delinquent taxes of approximately $26,439 for tax years 2015, 2016, 2017, and 2018. In his answer to the SOR, Applicant attributes his tax debts due to malfeasance by his accountant in approximately 2008, and when his wife failed to timely file their federal income tax returns for 2017 and 2018.

The \nGovernment\u2019s evidence is admitted. The case was assigned to me on March 2, 2022. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant admitted the SOR allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.d, 1.e, 1.f, 1.g, 1.h, 1.i and 1.j. \nHe partially admits SOR \u00b6 1.o and denies \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.c, 1.k, 1.l, 1.m.1.n, 1.p and 1.q. After \na thorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the \nfollowing findings of fact. \nApplicant is 54 years old. He was married from 1987 to 1989 and from 1990 to \nFebruary 2020. He has four adult children. In his government interrogatories he stated he \nbegan working for a federal contractor in August 2020. (Items 3, 4) \nIn Applicant\u2019s July 2020 security clearance application (SCA), he disclosed he \nfailed to timely file his 2017 and 2018 federal income tax returns. He attributed this to his \nex-wife\u2019s failure to timely file the returns when he was working overseas in 2017 and 2018. \nHe estimated he owed $40 for each tax year and his accountant was making payment \narrangements with the IRS. He also attributed his other financial problems to his ex-wife \nwho did not pay the bills while he was overseas and instead was using their money for \nother purposes. They are now divorced. (Items 2, 3) \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant is indebted to the federal government for \ndelinquent taxes of approximately $26,439 for tax years 2015, 2016, 2017, and 2018. In \nhis answer to the SOR, Applicant attributes his tax debts due to malfeasance by his \naccountant in approximately 2008, and when his wife failed to timely file their federal \nincome tax returns for 2017 and 2018. He stated that he owed federal income taxes in \n2008 because his accountant did not take care of his taxes. He believed he owed about \n$3,000, but then found out it was $10,000. He said he made payment arrangements with \nthe IRS, and that he and his wife \u201cwould chip away at the taxes but every year I had to \nroll the amount over.\u201d He said he had been working with the IRS since 2009 and when he \nwent overseas his ex-wife skipped making payments and then stopped. (Items 2, 3) \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR and interrogatory response, he provided \ndocuments from his current accountant stating that as of October 2021, Applicant owes \n$26,479 for tax years 2015 through 2018. His accountant was in communication with the \nIRS to set up a recurring monthly payment. Applicant has been making payments of $380 \nto the IRS since January 2021, and his accountant says he has satisfied his 2015 federal \nincome tax debt. Applicant\u2019s federal tax transcript from August 2021 shows a balance \nowed of $720. Presumably his additional payments would have satisfied the balance for \ntax year 2015. In September 2021, Applicant submitted a request for an installment \nagreement to the IRS for monthly payments of $380 for tax years 2015 through 2018. \nThere is no documentation to show the IRS has agreed to an installment agreement with \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nthe proposed payment amount. Other tax years\u2019 transcripts show inconsistent payments \ntoward tax debts owed for tax years that were not alleged in the SOR. (Items 2, 4, 8) \nI have not considered any derogatory evidence that was not alleged in the SOR \nfor disqualifying purposes. I may consider this information when making a credibility \ndetermination, in the application of mitigating conditions, and in my whole-person \nanalysis. \nApplicant provided a document from the creditor in SOR \u00b6 1.q verifying that he is \nnot responsible for this debt and it will be removed from his credit report. This debt is \nresolved. (Item 2) \nApplicant provided a receipt to show he made a $50 payment to a creditor, but it \nis unclear which creditor on the SOR this payment applies to. (Item 2) \nApplicant denies the medical debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b ($367), 1.k ($79), 1.l \n($77), 1.m ($39), 1.n ($33) and 1.p ($250). He stated he was unable to determine their \norigin. He did not provide any information as to what actions he took to dispute the debts. \nHe indicated they may belong to his son, but did not provide information as to whether he \ncontacted his son to resolve them. The debts are listed on his credit reports. These debts \nare unresolved. \nIn Applicant\u2019s SOR answer he states the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.c ($2,251) originated \nfrom a rental agreement and a dispute he has with the landlord. He said he is trying to \nresolve it. He did not provide any documents or information regarding efforts he has \nmade. It is unresolved. \n \nApplicant admits owing the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d ($1608), 1.e ($947), 1.f ($3,202), \n1.h ($807), 1.i ($1,275), 1.j $5,571), and 1.o ($1,100). He stated in his SOR answer that \nhe was making $100 payments toward the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.e. He did not provide evidence \nto substantiate his payments or actions he may be taking to resolve any of these alleged \ndebts. (Item 2)  \nApplicant partially admitted the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.g ($39,516). He stated in his SOR \nanswer that this debt is for two car loans. He said he is paying a portion of the debt based \non the vehicle he has, and that his ex-wife had the other vehicle that was financed and it \nwas repossessed. Applicant did not provide any documentation to substantiate that he is \nnot responsible for the whole amount or that he is making payments on the amount he \nbelieves he owes. He did not provide a copy of a divorce settlement which reflects his ex-\nwife would be responsible for this portion of the loan. (Items 5, 6, 7) \nCredit reports from July 2020, March 2021, and September 2021 substantiate the \ndelinquent debts alleged in the SOR are individual accounts or joint accounts belonging \nto Applicant.

He stated that prior to being employed \noverseas he was an active participant in community activities with the Rotary Club, fire \ndepartment and high school, and was considered a person in good standing. (Item 2)  \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set out \nin AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handing and safeguarding classified \ninformation. See ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nAG \u00b6 19 provides conditions that could raise security concerns. The following are \npotentially applicable: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \nApplicant failed to timely pay his 2015 through 2018 federal income taxes and \nowed approximately $26,439. He also accumulated numerous delinquent consumer and \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nmedical debts totaling approximately $57,022. There is sufficient evidence to support the \napplication of the above disqualifying conditions. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; \n(e) the individual had a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of action \nto resolve the issue; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nApplicant failed to timely pay his 2015 through 2018 federal income taxes. \nAlthough he attributes his tax issues to his wife who failed to timely file his 2017 and 2018 \ntax returns, it is clear from the evidence that his tax issues were a problem before then. \nHe said he and his wife would \u201cchip away\u201d at their tax debt, but subsequently rolled the \nbalance over to the next year. In January 2021, he began making monthly payments to \nthe IRS and in September 2021, he requested an installment agreement with them. No \nevidence was provided to show an agreement was accepted and he is in compliance with \nit. AG \u00b6 20(g) does not apply. \nSome of Applicant\u2019s financial problems can be attributed to his ex-wife, but \nApplicant\u2019s tax issues were apparent before he went overseas. Applicant trusted his wife \nto take care of the bills while he was gone. He claimed she did not and their debts became \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ndelinquent. This circumstance was beyond his control. Applicant has had sufficient time \nto address the delinquent debts he accumulated, but has not provided documentation to \nshow he is acting responsibly by making regular payments on debts, attempting \nsettlements, or disputing debts he believes do not belong to him. AG\u00b6 20(b) partially \napplies. \nApplicant did not provide evidence he has participated in financial counseling, or \ninitiated a good-faith effort to resolve his debts. He is given credit for making consistent \npayments since January 2021 toward his tax debt, but he did not provide proof of \npayments towards other debts. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(c) and 20(d) do not apply. He disputed the debt \nin SOR \u00b6 1.q and the creditor acknowledged it did not belong to him. It is resolved. He \nalso disputes other debts, but failed to provide evidence to substantiate his actions \nregarding his disputes or to resolve the debts. AG \u00b6 20(e) does not apply. \nApplicant did not provide evidence he maintains a current budget or of his financial \nresources and ability to resolve his delinquent debts. His delinquent debts and tax issues \nare ongoing and remain unresolved. The evidence is insufficient to conclude future issues \nare unlikely to recur. AG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. \nApplicant has not established a reliable financial track record at this time and has \nnot met his burden of persuasion. The record evidence leaves me with questions and \ndoubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nreasons, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns arising under \nGuideline F, financial considerations. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.o: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.q: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance.

Eligibility for \naccess to classified information is granted. \nStatement of the Case \nOn June 1, 2021, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued a Statement of \nReasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under Guideline I \n(psychological conditions). Applicant responded to the SOR on June 26, 2021, and \nrequested a hearing before an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on \nNovember 18, 2021. \nThe hearing was convened as scheduled on December 15, 2021. Government \nExhibit (GE) 1 was admitted in evidence without objection. The objections to GE 2 \nthrough 4 (Office of Personnel Management reports of investigation (OPM ROI)) were \nsustained. GE 5 is a report of a psychological evaluation requested by the Department \nof Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility (DOD CAF). Applicant objected to the \nreport because it relied on information that was inadmissible at the hearing (e.g. GE 2-\n4).

The objection will go to the weight given to those facts not the admissibility of \nthe exhibit. \nApplicant testified and submitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AE) A through H, which \nwere admitted without objection.

When he was \nin high school, he took his father\u2019s gun and hid it in his room. He stated that he thought \nhe was a failure and his father was abusing him. He told a teacher who reported it to the \npolice. He was hospitalized for three days in 1999 when he was about 18 or 19 years \nold, after suffering from depression.

He asserted that he stabbed the co-\nworker in self-defense to stop the choking. He went to a hospital and reported he had \nsuicidal thoughts. He was hospitalized for three days. He may have been diagnosed \nwith bipolar disorder and borderline personality disorder.1 In his December 2018 \n1 The evidence of the borderline personality disorder comes from the DOD records that were reviewed by \nthe psychologist for the DOD CAF but not offered into evidence.

He pleaded nolo \ncontendere and was sentenced to probation for three years. He continued taking \nmedication until about 2005. Applicant stated it was the last time he was in a fight. (Tr. \nat 28-36, 47, 50-58; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1, 5; AE F) \nApplicant worked for a large federal contractor, primarily overseas, from 2013 \nuntil he was terminated in January 2018 after allegations of misconduct. He stated that \nthe termination letter contained words to the effect that he was \u201cterminated for \naggressive behavior.\u201d He stated that he was dealing with bullies at work, and there was \nan incident where they pulled his pants down. They took a video of his private parts and \nposted it on social media. On another occasion, he was recovering from surgery and \nhad to wear adult diapers because of the bleeding. His co-workers pulled his pants \ndown exposing the diapers and again posted the video on social media. Applicant \nkicked a drawer out of embarrassment and frustration with his co-workers. He \ncomplained to management, but \u201cit was kind of swept under the rug.\u201d He asserted that \nhis tormentors falsely accused him of unprofessional conduct, including racism, arguing \nwith customers, and creating a hostile work environment. He stated that his tormentors \nwere doing to him exactly what they reported that he was doing. Applicant stated that he \nwas the subject of racial remarks by several employees. (Tr. at 37-43, 59-63; \nApplicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1, 5; AE F, H) \nApplicant also stated that he refused to lie to cover up management\u2019s unethical \npractices and systemic security violations. He complained to management as early as \nJanuary 2017. He also stated a subordinate confronted him, would not comply with \nApplicant\u2019s directives, shouted at Applicant, and tried to block Applicant from leaving his \noffice. Applicant was terminated after an internal company investigation. Applicant filed \na complaint with a defense agency\u2019s inspector general (IG). He reported several \nemployees for unethical conduct; fraud, waste, and abuse; and violating security \nprocedures. The investigation is apparently still pending. (Tr. at 37-43, 59-63; \nApplicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1, 5; AE F, H) \nApplicant returned to counseling after the termination. He moved at one point \nand saw several therapists, including an online therapist for about four to six months. \nThe online therapist thought Applicant was non-compliant,2 but Applicant stated it was \nbecause he had started seeing his current physician who prescribed his medication. (Tr. \nat 47, 63-65; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 5; AE F) \n2 The evidence that Applicant was noncompliant comes from a statement by the therapist that was in the \nDOD records reviewed by the psychologist for the DOD CAF, but not offered into evidence. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nDOD CAF Psychological Evaluation - February 2021 \nThe DOD CAF requested that Applicant undergo a psychological evaluation. The \nevaluation was conducted on February 1, 2021, by a licensed psychologist (hereinafter \nreferred to as psychologist or DOD CAF psychologist) who was contracted from private \npractice by the DOD CAF. A report of the evaluation was prepared on February 28, \n2021. The psychologist was provided with a \u201cDOD CAF Psych Consult,\u201d Applicant\u2019s \nDecember 2018 SF 86, and \u201cInvestigative Results Report 20190516.\u201d The SF 86 is in \nevidence; the other two documents are not. The Psych Consult is apparently the \nrequest for the evaluation and the Investigative Results Report is apparently the OPM \nbackground investigation. \nThe psychologist used the DOD records at her disposal to interview Applicant \nabout his history. No actual medical records were available to the psychologist. They \ndiscussed his hospitalizations in 1999 and 2003. She reported that he \u201cwas diagnosed \nwith Bipolar Disorder and Borderline Personality Disorder, according to DOD records, \nalthough he reported only Bipolar Disorder.\u201d She did not explain when he was \ndiagnosed and under what circumstances. She reported: \nDue to the lack of records and data, it is unclear if [Applicant\u2019s] previous \ndiagnoses are accurate, if there are other diagnoses present, and/or if he \ncontinues to experience significant mental health issues, as he was not \nforthcoming \nand \nprovided \ncontradictory \ninformation \nabout \nhis \npsychological status. [Applicant\u2019s] behavioral presentation could suggest a \nmood or personality disorder, but further data is needed to confirm these \ndiagnoses. Regardless of the fact that specific diagnoses are unclear, his \nhistory suggests that there have been serious mood issues. Currently, \nhowever, [Applicant] reported experiencing anxiety symptoms related to \nstress. \nThe psychologist also noted that Applicant received counseling from February \n2018 through May 2019. She indicated that a statement from the therapist \u201cindicated \nthat he was not compliant with most of the therapist\u2019s recommendations, including \nseeking psychiatric care; however, no records were able to be obtained.\u201d The \npsychologist provided the following diagnosis:  \nAdjustment Disorder with anxiety \nR/O Bipolar Disorder (by history) \nR/O Borderline Personality Disorder (by history) \nIn psychological evaluations, the term \u201cR/O\u201d followed by a disorder does not \nmean that the individual is diagnosed with that disorder. It means the evaluator has to \n\u201crule out\u201d that diagnosis. See e.g., https://www.medfriendly.com/rule-out-diagnosis.html: \nRule out means to eliminate as a possibility. For example, a doctor may \nhave a patient\u2019s blood pressure tested to rule out high blood pressure. \nThat is, the doctor wants to know if the results from the test will eliminate \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nthe possibility that the patient has high blood pressure. Rule out is \ncommonly abbreviated as R/O in medical charts. In the example above, \nthe doctor\u2019s note to the health care worker that performs the test may say: \nR/O high blood pressure. It is important to note that this does not mean \nthat the patient has been diagnosed with high blood pressure. In doctor \nnotes, rule outs are typically listed underneath diagnoses that have \nalready been established. \nThe psychologist concluded: \n[Applicant] presents with a psychiatric condition that could pose a \nsignificant risk to his judgment, reliability or trustworthiness concerning \nclassified information. [Applicant] reported that he is not and has not \nexperienced significant mood symptoms, although his history suggests \notherwise. Throughout the evaluation process, [Applicant] has been a poor \nhistorian and has provided conflicting information, and he has minimized \nhis condition. The fact that [Applicant] attacked a coworker and kicked an \nobject while at work is extremely concerning. He was terminated, but he \nfeels that this was unjustified. These are the only scenarios that he has \nadmitted to, while there were allegations of \u201cunprofessional conduct, \nfighting with customers, targeting employees, racism, and creating a \nhostile work environment.\u201d These all suggest poor judgment, which would \nonly be exacerbated by the fact that [Applicant] is not in treatment; and if \nhis previous diagnoses are accurate, his current medication is not \naddressing those symptoms. [Applicant\u2019s] mental health status appears to \nhave had negative impacts on his work performance and his ability to \nmaintain working relationships with others. \nFor the reasons stated above, [Applicant\u2019s] prognosis is guarded to poor. \nHis denial of mental health issues only further demonstrates his poor \njudgment, which was evident behaviorally at his last job. His symptoms \nhave required hospitalization in the past, and his online therapist indicated \nthat he was noncompliant. While [Applicant] does not appear willing to \nengage in psychotherapy, it could potentially improve his prognosis. \nApplicant\u2019s Psychological Evaluation - August 2021 \nApplicant sought his own evaluation from a licensed clinical forensic psychologist \n(hereinafter psychologist or Applicant\u2019s psychologist) with extensive experience in \nforensic psychology. The psychologist considered documents provided by Applicant, \nincluding the DOD CAF evaluation, the SOR, and a \u201cDefense Legal Services Agency, \nletter to [Applicant] dated August 13, 2021,\u201d which I assume is the \u201cdiscovery\u201d letter \nfrom Department Counsel to Applicant. The psychologist conducted a psychological test \non Applicant and interviewed him for about two hours. The report of that evaluation is \ndated August 30, 2021.

The report included a lay description of depression from the Mayo \nClinic: \nDepression is a mood disorder that causes a persistent feeling of sadness \nand loss of interest. Also called major depressive disorder or clinical \ndepression, it affects how you feel, think and behave and can lead to a \nvariety of emotional and physical problems. You may have trouble doing \nnormal day-to-day activities, and sometimes you may feel as if life isn\u2019t \nworth living. \nMore than just a bout of the blues, depression isn\u2019t a weakness and you \ncan\u2019t simply \u201csnap out\u201d of it. Depression may require long-term treatment, \npsychological counseling or both. \nSymptoms of depression include (some symptoms not included in this decision \nbut available in the report and the DSM-5): \n\uf0b7 Feelings of sadness, tearfulness, emptiness or hopelessness \n\uf0b7 Angry outbursts, irritability or frustration, even over small matters \n\uf0b7 Anxiety, agitation or restlessness \n\uf0b7 Trouble thinking, concentration, making decisions and remembering things \n\uf0b7 Frequent or recurrent thoughts of death, suicidal thoughts, suicide attempts or \nsuicide \nThe psychologist concluded: \n[Applicant] has experienced several episodes of depression, all of which \nhave responded well to medication. During one such episode, [Applicant], \nas a result of his depressed mood, engaged in criminal behavior involving \nan assault. That was in 2003. [Applicant] has as far as is known, been free \nfrom criminal behavior subsequently. \nAlthough [Applicant] is subject to depression, he is able to seek \nappropriate treatment and has responded well to prescribed medications. \n[Applicant] is insightful regarding his need for treatment and his need for \nmedication compliance to maintain his stability. \nApplicant\u2019s psychologist agreed with the DOD CAF psychologist\u2019s evaluation that \nApplicant suffers from a mental health disorder and that he needs ongoing medication \ntreatment. He disagreed with the DOD CAF psychologist\u2019s \u201cimplication that all \nallegations against [Applicant] are, in fact, accurate and that allegations with which \nApplicant has disagreed are merely instances of [Applicant] not having \u2018admitted\u2019 to \nthem.\u201d He noted that the fact that the DOD CAF psychologist had \u201cno basis for \ndetermining which allegations are accurate yet forges ahead with the conclusion that \nthe worst beliefs about [Applicant] are correct demonstrates such an extreme degree of \nbias that her report should be discarded.\u201d \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nDiagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5) \n \n \nAdjustment Disorder with Anxiety \nAccording to the DSM-5, the essential feature of adjustment disorders is the \npresence of emotional or behavioral symptoms in response to an identifiable stressor. \nBy definition, the disturbance in adjustment disorders begins within three months of \nonset of a stressor and lasts no longer than six months after the stressor or its \nconsequences have ceased. A stressor may be a single event (e.g., a termination of a \nromantic relationship), or there may be multiple stressors (e.g., marked business \ndifficulties and marital problems). Stressors may be recurrent (e.g., associated with \nseasonal business crises, unfulfilling sexual relationships) or continuous (e.g., a \npersistent painful illness with increasing disability, living in a crime-ridden \nneighborhood). \nSymptoms or behaviors are clinically significant, as evidenced by one or both of \nthe following: \n1.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Marked distress that is out of proportion to the severity or intensity of the \nstressor, taking into account the external context and the cultural factors that \nmight influence symptom severity and presentation. \n2. Significant impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of \nfunctioning. \nFor adjustment disorder with anxiety, the symptom of nervousness, worry, \njitteriness, or separation anxiety is predominant. \n \nMajor Depressive Disorder \nThe criterion symptoms for major depressive disorder must be present nearly \nevery day to be considered present, with the exception of weight change and suicidal \nideation. Fatigue and sleep disturbance are present in a high proportion of cases; \npsychomotor disturbances are much less common but are indicative of greater overall \nseverity, as is the presence of delusional or near-delusional guilt. \nThe essential feature of a major depressive episode is a period of at least two \nweeks during which there is either depressed mood or the loss of interest or pleasure in \nnearly all activities. Many individuals report or exhibit increased irritability (e.g., \npersistent anger, a tendency to respond to events with angry outbursts or blaming \nothers, an exaggerated sense of frustration over minor events). \nA major depressive episode that occurs in response to a psychosocial stressor is \ndistinguished from adjustment disorder with depressed mood by the fact that the full \ncriteria for a major depressive episode are not met in adjustment disorder. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nIn full remission means that during the past two months, no significant signs or \nsymptoms of the disturbance were present. \nApplicant\u2019s Current Treatment  \nApplicant is seeing a therapist.

(AE B-E) \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline I: Psychological Conditions \nThe security concern for psychological conditions is set out in AG \u00b6 27: \nCertain emotional, mental, and personality conditions can impair \njudgment, reliability, or trustworthiness. A formal diagnosis of a disorder is \nnot required for there to be a concern under this guideline. A duly qualified \nmental health professional (e.g., clinical psychologist or psychiatrist) \nemployed by, or acceptable to and approved by the U.S. Government, \nshould be consulted when evaluating potentially disqualifying and \nmitigating information under this guideline and an opinion, including \nprognosis, should be sought. No negative inference concerning the \nstandards in this guideline may be raised solely on the basis of mental \nhealth counseling. \nAG \u00b6 28 provides conditions that could raise security concerns. AG \u00b6 29 provides \nconditions that could mitigate those security concerns. The following are potentially \napplicable: \n28(a) behavior that casts doubt on an individual\u2019s judgment, stability, \nreliability, or trustworthiness, not covered under any other guideline and \nthat may indicate an emotional, mental, or personality condition, including, \nbut not limited to, irresponsible, violent, self-harm, suicidal, paranoid, \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nmanipulative, impulsive, chronic lying, deceitful, exploitative, or bizarre \nbehaviors; \n28(b) an opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional that the \nindividual has a condition that may impair judgment, stability, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness; \n28(c) voluntary or involuntary inpatient hospitalization; \n28(d) failure to follow a prescribed treatment plan related to a diagnosed \npsychological/psychiatric condition that may impair judgment, stability, \nreliability, or trustworthiness, including, but not limited to, failure to take \nprescribed medication or failure to attend required counseling sessions; \n29(a) the identified condition is readily controllable with treatment, and the \nindividual has demonstrated ongoing and consistent compliance with the \ntreatment plan; \n29(b) the individual has voluntarily entered a counseling or treatment \nprogram for a condition that is amenable to treatment, and the individual is \ncurrently receiving counseling or treatment with a favorable prognosis by a \nduly qualified mental health professional; \n29(c) recent opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional \nemployed by, or acceptable to and approved by, the U.S. Government that \nan individual\u2019s previous condition is under control or in remission, and has \na low probability of recurrence or exacerbation; \n29(d) the past psychological/psychiatric condition was temporary, the \nsituation has been resolved, and the individual no longer shows \nindications of emotional instability; and \n29(e) there is no indication of a current problem. \nSOR \u00b6 1.a \nSOR \u00b6 1.a alleges that Applicant received mental health treatment in 2003 for \nsuicidal tendencies, and that he was diagnosed with bipolar I without psychosis and \nborderline personality disorder. SOR \u00b6 1.b alleges that Applicant received mental health \ntreatment in 2019 following his termination for misconduct. Both allegations suffer from \nthe same problem - that receiving mental health treatment raises a security concern. It \ndoes not. See AG \u00b6 27(a): \u201cNo negative inference concerning the standards in this \nguideline may be raised solely on the basis of mental health counseling.\u201d \nApplicant denied receiving mental health treatment for \u201csuicidal tendencies.\u201d \nHowever, that is not a medical term; the language came directly from Applicant\u2019s SF 86. \nThere is no dispute that Applicant was hospitalized for three days in 2003.

AG \u00b6 28(c) is applicable. \nThere is some evidence in the DOD CAF psychological evaluation that Applicant \nwas diagnosed at some point with bipolar disorder and borderline personality disorder. \nShe based that on \u201cDOD records\u201d that were not made available for Applicant\u2019s hearing. \nShe did not explain when he was diagnosed and under what circumstances. She also \nreported that \u201c[d]ue to the lack of records and data, it is unclear if [Applicant\u2019s] previous \ndiagnoses are accurate.\u201d There is some evidence that AG \u00b6 28(b) may have been \napplicable at some point, but there is no evidence that Applicant currently suffers from \nthose disorders. To the extent that AG \u00b6 28(b) was applicable; it is also mitigated. \nSOR \u00b6 1.b \nSOR \u00b6 1.b alleges that Applicant received mental health treatment in 2019 \nfollowing his termination for misconduct. As previously indicated, the mental health \ntreatment does not raise a security concern. Workplace misconduct can constitute \nbehavior that casts doubt on an individual\u2019s judgment, stability, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. However, that behavior is covered under the personal conduct \nguideline, and by definition under AG \u00b6 28(a) it cannot be \u201cbehavior that casts doubt on \nan individual\u2019s judgment, stability, reliability, or trustworthiness, not covered under any \nother guideline.\u201d As such, the workplace misconduct cannot be used to establish AG \u00b6 \n28(a) as a disqualifying condition. SOR \u00b6 1.b is concluded for Applicant. \nSOR \u00b6 1.c \nSOR \u00b6 1.c alleges the DOD CAF evaluation. It arguably also alleges the \nhospitalizations, the workplace misconduct that is already alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b, and \nthat Applicant was noncompliant with his online therapist\u2019s recommendations. \n \n  \nHospitalizations - AG \u00b6 28(c) \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 28(c) is established by Applicant\u2019s hospitalizations in 1999 and 2003. \n \n \nWorkplace Misconduct - AG \u00b6 28(a) \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAs discussed above, workplace misconduct cannot be used to establish AG \u00b6 \n28(a) as a disqualifying condition. \n  \n \nNoncompliance - AG \u00b6 28(d) \nSOR \u00b6 1.c has the following language: \u201cyour online therapist indicated that you \nwere noncompliant with her recommendations.\u201d There is a slight, but important \ndifference between the language in the allegation and the language in AG \u00b6 28(d), \nwhich requires \u201ca prescribed treatment plan\u201d and not just a recommendation.

She also reported \u201c[Applicant] presents with a psychiatric condition that could \npose a significant risk to his judgment, reliability or trustworthiness concerning classified \ninformation.\u201d On its face, that statement is enough to establish AG \u00b6 28(b). \nAG \u00b6 28(b) requires 1) an opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional \nthat the individual has a condition; and 2) that the condition may impair judgment, \nstability, reliability, or trustworthiness. Some conditions, such as schizophrenia and \ndelusional disorder (not present in this case), clearly impair judgment, stability, \nreliability, and trustworthiness, and can be accepted as such without further elaboration \nby the mental health professional. Other conditions may require elaboration by the \nmental health professional as to how the condition may impair the individual\u2019s judgment, \nstability, reliability, or trustworthiness. \nThere are several issues with the DOD CAF psychologist\u2019s opinion. It is unclear \nwhat condition the psychologist is referring to. I can only assume it is the diagnosis of \nadjustment disorder with anxiety. That disorder requires the presence of emotional or \nbehavioral symptoms in response to an identifiable stressor, with the disturbance in \nadjustment disorders beginning within three months of onset of a stressor and lasting no \nlonger than six months after the stressor or its consequences have ceased. The DOD \nCAF psychologist never identified a stressor. The psychologist also never indicated \nwhy, unless the stressor was recurrent (e.g., associated with seasonal business crises, \nunfulfilling sexual relationships) or continuous (e.g., a persistent painful illness with \nincreasing disability, living in a crime-ridden neighborhood), it would still be a problem \nafter more than six months have passed. \nFor adjustment disorder with anxiety, the DSM-5 states that the symptom of \nnervousness, worry, jitteriness, or separation anxiety is predominant. The DOD CAF \npsychologist made a conclusory statement, but she never explained why a disorder with \nthose symptoms is a condition that may impair judgment, stability, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness. \nApplicant\u2019s psychologist agreed with the DOD CAF psychologist\u2019s evaluation that \nApplicant suffers from a mental health disorder, and that he needs ongoing medication \ntreatment. He disagreed with the DOD CAF evaluator\u2019s diagnosis and diagnosed \nApplicant with major depressive disorder, recurrent episode, in full remission (with \nmedication). I \n am satisfied that Applicant has a mental health disorder, and I believe it is \nmore likely major depressive disorder than adjustment disorder.  \nOf note, from a security clearance perspective, major depressive disorder may \nraise more concerns than adjustment disorder. The DSM-5 reports that many \nindividuals with major depressive disorder report or exhibit increased irritability (e.g., \npersistent anger, a tendency to respond to events with angry outbursts or blaming \nothers, an exaggerated sense of frustration over minor events). This is consistent with \n12 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s psychologist\u2019s statement that in 2003, Applicant \u201cas a result of his \ndepressed mood, engaged in criminal behavior involving an assault.\u201d \nThe two psychologists differ on Applicant\u2019s conduct, as apparently contained in \nROIs that were available to the DOD CAF psychologist and possibly Applicant\u2019s \npsychologist, but not to me. Applicant\u2019s psychologist took issue with the \u201cimplication that \nall allegations against [Applicant] are, in fact, accurate and that allegations with which \nApplicant has disagreed are merely instances of [Applicant] not having \u2018admitted\u2019 to \nthem.\u201d I do not agree that it is inappropriate for an evaluating psychologist to use other \ninformation to form an opinion or even arrive at conclusions about the accuracy of that \ninformation. Unfortunately, in this case I do not have any of those records that would \nenable me to form my own opinion. Additionally, even if Applicant committed the \nworkplace misconduct, it is difficult for me to attribute that conduct to adjustment \ndisorder. I also note that criminal conduct and workplace misconduct should not be \nalleged under Guideline I, and the conduct was not alleged under any other guidelines. \nI further note that Applicant was terminated in January 2018, and he has worked \nfor his current employer since about September 2018, but there is no evidence of the \nrecurrence of any problematic conduct. There is evidence that he was a good employee \nthrough 2017, and he reported other employees in January 2017, a full year before he \nwas terminated. I also note there is evidence that he has been a good employee for his \ncurrent company. \nConclusion  \nI am satisfied that Applicant has suffered from some form of depression since at \nleast high school. He was hospitalized in 1999 and was arrested and hospitalized in \n2003. He was terminated from a job in 2018, but it is unclear if his mental health \ncondition had anything to do with the termination. His work record is otherwise good. I \ndo not find that he was noncompliant with his therapist\u2019s recommendations; he simply \nchanged providers. He is currently in counseling and is prescribed medication. I find that \nthe identified condition is readily controllable with treatment, and Applicant has \ndemonstrated ongoing and consistent compliance with his treatment plan. AG \u00b6 29(a) is \napplicable. Psychological conditions security concerns are mitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \n13 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline I in my whole-person analysis. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant \nmitigated the psychological conditions security concerns.  \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline I: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.c: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Recognizing the complexities of \nhuman behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the \nadjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, \nimpartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a \nconscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d \nThe administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the \nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours. The Government reposes a high degree of \ntrust and confidence in those granted access to classified information. Decisions \ninclude, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the applicant may deliberately or \ninadvertently fail to safeguard such information. Decisions shall be in terms of the \nnational interest and do not question the loyalty of an applicant. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe security concern for this guideline is set forth in AG \u00b6 24, where it is noted \nthat the illegal use of a controlled substance, and the use of other substances that can \ncause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner inconsistent with their \nintended purpose, can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability and \ntrustworthiness. This is because such behavior may lead to physical or psychological \nimpairment and because it raises questions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to \ncomply with laws, rules, and regulations. Such use also raised questions about a \nperson\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \nApplicant\u2019s admissions establish that he purchased and used marijuana as \nalleged in the SOR. The record also establishes that Applicant used illegal drugs after \nbeing granted a security clearance in 2018 and he used after completing his security \nclearance application. Applicant\u2019s use of marijuana after he knew that his position with a \nfederal contactor required him to refrain from drugs shows a recklessness. This is \nsufficient to raise AG \u00b6 25(a): any substance misuse, AG \u00b6 25(c) illegal possession of a \ncontrolled substance, including \u2026 purchase or sale; AG \u00b6 25(f): any illegal drug use \nwhile granted access to classified information or holding a sensitive position; and AG \n25(g) expressed intent to continue drug involvement and substance misuse, or failure to \nclearly and convincingly commit to discontinue such misuse. The Government\u2019s \nsubstantial evidence, as provided by Applicant\u2019s admissions, thus raises security \nconcerns under Guideline H. Therefore, the burden shifts to Applicant to produce \nevidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate related security concerns. \nUnder Guideline H, conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising from \ndrug involvement and substance misuse are enumerated. The following mitigating \nconditions under AG \u00b6 26 potentially apply to Applicant\u2019s case: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \nand  \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions to overcome this problem, \nand has established a pattern of abstinence, including but not limited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; (2) changing \nor avoiding the environment where drugs were used; and (3) providing a \nsigned statement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, acknowledging that any future involvement or misuse \nis grounds for revocation of national security eligibility.   \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s last use of marijuana, an illegal substance, took place in 2020. At the \ntime he was holding a security clearance. He has not identified any circumstances that \nwould suggest the drug use is unlikely to recur. This casts doubt about his judgment \nand reliability because he used marijuana while holding a security clearance and \nprovided misleading false statements about her marijuana use. I find that none of the \nmitigating conditions apply. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nThe security concern for personal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 15: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. \nApplicant admitted that he intentionally falsified his e-QIP regarding his most \nrecent drug use. He admitted in his subject interview that he did that to enhance his \nchance in getting a clearance. Between 2014 and 2019, Applicant made nine conflicting \nstatements to the Government about his illegal drug use and purchase of marijuana. I \nfind that Applicant intentionally falsified material facts on his 2020 e-QIP regarding his \ndrug use and purchase of illegal drugs while holding a security clearance. \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying conditions are potentially applicable: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine national security \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities, and \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole \nperson \nassessment \nof \nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the person may not \nproperly safeguard classified or sensitive information. \nApplicant provided false information. He has not identified any efforts that he made to \ncorrect the falsifications. The offenses are not minor, and he has not expressed any \nremorse. His lack of candor and inconsistent statements do not persuade me that his \nillegal drug use will not recur. It casts doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, and good \njudgment. He has not presented sufficient evidence to mitigate the personal conduct \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n        \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nconcerns.

Any \ndoubts must be resolved in favor of the Government. Under these circumstances, I find \nApplicant has not mitigated the security concerns raised under drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, nor under personal conduct due to intentional falsification of his e-\nQIP.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant, age 52, is married with two minor children. His educational history was not indicated in the record. He has been employed since October 2017 by the defense contractor sponsoring his SCA. This is his first application for a security clearance. He was initially hired as a security officer and is now working as an Emergency Communications Center (ECC) dispatcher. (Items 3, 4; Item 5 at 34) The SOR, as amended, alleged a mortgage foreclosure (SOR \u00b6 1.e) and seven delinquent debts totaling $57,088, including two state tax liens totaling $17,390 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b); two repossession-related consumer debts totaling $32,140 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c., 1.d); a $809 state tax debt (SOR \u00b6 1.i); and two federal tax debts totaling $6,749 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.j, 1.k). It also alleged that Applicant failed to timely file his federal and state income tax returns for tax years 2008 through 2019 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f \u20131.h), which he deliberately failed to disclose on his SCA (SOR \u00b6 2.a). In his answer to the original SOR, Applicant admitted SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.c and 1.f through 1.h. He did not address SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d and 1.e, which I construed as denials. Although he answered \u201cI admit\u201d to SOR \u00b6 2.a, I construed it as a denial because his accompanying explanation equivocated on the issue of intent.

Eligibility for access to classified \ninformation is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on November 16, 2017. \nOn July 13, 2021, the Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency Consolidated \nAdjudications Facility (CAF) sent him a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging security \nconcerns under Guidelines F and E. The CAF acted under Department of Defense (DOD) \nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) \nimplemented by the DOD on June 8, 2017. \nApplicant answered the SOR on August 2, 2021, and requested a decision on the \nwritten record in lieu of a hearing. On October 15, 2021, the Government sent Applicant \na complete copy of its written case, a file of relevant material (FORM), including pleadings \nand evidentiary documents identified as Items 1 through 7. He was given an opportunity \nto submit a documentary response setting forth objections, rebuttal, extenuation, \nmitigation, or explanation to the Government\u2019s evidence.

Applicant\u2019s SOR answer included documents that are admitted \ninto evidence collectively as Applicant Exhibit (AE) A. The case was assigned to me on \nJanuary 7, 2022. \nProcedural Matters \nThis matter was inadvertently mischaracterized as an automated data processing \n(ADP) case. I administratively amended the caption of the SOR to reflect this matter as \nan ISCR case, and disregarded any other ADP-related references in the SOR and \nelsewhere in the record. \nOn February 28, 2022, the Government submitted copies of documents that were \ninadvertently missing from Item 5 of the FORM, with notice to Applicant. I appended those \ndocuments to the record, marking the pages as Item 5 at 17 a through c (given that they \nare the referenced attachments to page 17 of Item 5). I also advised the parties that, \nalthough the record remained closed, I would consider a motion to reopen it filed by either \nparty on or before March 3, 2022. Neither party filed such a motion. On March 1, 2022, \nApplicant advised that he did not wish to reopen to the record, but queried whether \nDOHA\u2019s jurisdiction continued following a change in his job position and clearance need. \nOn March 4, 2022, after the Government confirmed that DOHA retained its jurisdiction, \nand in the absence of evidence to the contrary from Applicant, I notified the parties that \nthe case would proceed. I appended to the record copies of the related email \ncommunications collectively as Administrative Exhibit (AX) I. \nSOR Amendment \nIn the FORM, the Government amended the SOR by modifying five existing \nallegations and by adding three new allegations under paragraph 1, Guideline F. \nApplicant was provided with reasonable notice of, and an opportunity to respond to, the \namended SOR allegations. He failed to respond to either the FORM or the amended SOR \nallegations, and did not otherwise object to the amended SOR allegations. \nThe SOR was amended to modify the existing Guideline F allegations under \nparagraph 1, as follows: \na. You are indebted to [State A] for a tax lien entered against you in 2012, \nin the approximate amount of $14,839.00. \nb.

As of the date of this statement of Reasons, it remains unpaid. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant, age 52, is married with two minor children. His educational history was \nnot indicated in the record. He has been employed since October 2017 by the defense \ncontractor sponsoring his SCA. This is his first application for a security clearance. He \nwas initially hired as a security officer and is now working as an Emergency \nCommunications Center (ECC) dispatcher. (Items 3, 4; Item 5 at 34) \nThe SOR, as amended, alleged a mortgage foreclosure (SOR \u00b6 1.e) and seven \ndelinquent debts totaling $57,088, including two state tax liens totaling $17,390 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.a, 1.b); two repossession-related consumer debts totaling $32,140 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c., 1.d); \na $809 state tax debt (SOR \u00b6 1.i); and two federal tax debts totaling $6,749 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.j, \n1.k). It also alleged that Applicant failed to timely file his federal and state income tax \nreturns for tax years 2008 through 2019 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f \u20131.h), which he deliberately failed to \ndisclose on his SCA (SOR \u00b6 2.a). \nIn his answer to the original SOR, Applicant admitted SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.c and \n1.f through 1.h. He did not address SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d and 1.e, which I construed as denials. \nAlthough he answered \u201cI admit\u201d to SOR \u00b6 2.a, I construed it as a denial because his \naccompanying explanation equivocated on the issue of intent. He explained: \u201cThis item \non my [SCA] was a mistake on my part.\u201d It is unclear whether he meant that he mistakenly \nomitted the information or that it was a mistake for him to deliberately omit the information. \n(Item 3) \nSince Applicant did not respond to the amended SOR, I construed his \nnonresponses to the new allegations, SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.i through 1.k, as denials. Despite his \nearlier admissions, I also construed his nonresponses to the five modified allegations, \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, and 1.f through 1.h, as denials because the changes were substantive. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n---\nSCA \nApplicant answered \u201cno\u201d to all of the financial questions on his November 2017 \nSCA, including whether, in the last seven years, he: 1) failed to file or pay federal or state \ntaxes when required by law; 2) had a lien placed against his property for failing to pay \ntaxes; 3) had any possessions or property voluntarily or involuntarily repossessed or \nforeclosed; 4) defaulted on any type of loan; or 5) had been 120 days or more delinquent \non any debt. The SCA also asked whether he was then 120 days or more delinquent on \nany debt, to which he also answered \u201cno.\u201d Applicant did not otherwise disclose his \ndelinquent returns or other derogatory financial history on the SCA. He affirmed his \u201cno\u201d \nresponses to the financial questions on the signature form of the SCA by certifying that: \nMy statements on this form . . . are true, complete, and correct to the best \nof my knowledge and belief and are made in good faith . . . . I understand \nthat intentionally withholding, misrepresenting, falsifying . . . may have a \nnegative effect on my security clearance, employment prospects, or job \nstatus, up to and including denial or revocation of my security clearance . . \n. . (Item 4) \nApplicant was interviewed five times during the security clearance background \ninvestigation initiated by his November 2017 SCA. During Interview 1 (November 28, \n2018), he was confronted with delinquent debts that were developed from a review of his \nDecember 2017 credit report (Item 6), including two utility debts ($174 and $325) and the \ndebts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.d. While he provided information about the two \nutility accounts, he denied that either of them were delinquent. He denied knowledge of \nthe SOR debts, but promised to investigate them and the two utility accounts, and pay \nthose deemed valid. He then volunteered information about the foreclosure alleged in \nSOR \u00b6 1.e. (Item 5 at 6-9) \nDuring Interview 1, Applicant claimed that he answered \u201cno\u201d to questions about his \nfinancial record because he either misunderstood the question or did not know about a \nparticular debt. He also asserted that any known bills had been paid. It is unclear whether \nhe meant that he knew he had delinquent debts, but did not list them because they had \nbeen paid; or whether he denied having any delinquent debts because he paid all of his \nbills on time. I inferred the latter because he subsequently declared that he thought his \nfinances were excellent prior to being confronted with the developed debts, and that he \nwould not have deliberately failed to pay a debt. He planned to resolve any delinquent \ndebts for his own personal responsibility and promised to stay on top of his financial \nobligations in the future. (Item 5 at 6-9) \nDuring Interview 2 (June 19, 2019), Applicant described his financial situation as \ngood. He asserted that he paid cash for everything and had no credit cards or credit-card \ndebts to his knowledge. He reviewed an April 2019 credit report (which was not included \nin the record), and was asked about the status of the debts with which he had been \nconfronted during Interview 1. He paid the $174 utility debt via phone during Interview 2. \nHe maintained that he could not provide specific details about the $325 utility debt and \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nthe four debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.d, but promised to speak with his wife and \nattempt to gather documentation about them. (Item 5 at 11-12, 17c) \nDuring Interviews 3 (June 30, 2019) and 4 (July 1, 2019), Applicant provided the \ndetails he learned about the $325 utility account and the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a \nthrough 1.d, and proffered plans to resolve them. He provided evidence that he paid the \n$325 utility account on June 20, 2019, which was apparently deemed sufficient enough \nthat it was not alleged in the SOR. (Item 5 at 13-17) \nApplicant did not discuss his failure to file 2008 through 2019 federal and state \nincome tax returns until Interview 5 (July 3, 2019). During Interview 5, he was asked why \nthe state tax liens alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b had not been offset by his federal \nrefunds. In response, he disclosed that he had not filed any federal or state returns since \napproximately 2008. He then proffered plans to file his delinquent returns, with the help \nof a tax accountant, and pay any outstanding tax obligations resulting therefrom. He did \nnot specify a date for compliance with his filing and payment obligations, but anticipated \nthat his returns would be filed as soon as the tax accountant received information \nrequested from the IRS. (Item 5 at 18) \nDuring Interview 5, Applicant could not give a reason for why he omitted his tax \ncompliance failures from his SCA, but asserted his belief that he had been compliant with \npaying his taxes because they were deducted from his paychecks. In his SOR answer, \nhe explained: \u201cWe simply found ourselves overwhelmed and did not file.\u201d (Item 4 at 18; \nItem 3) \nTax Returns \nApplicant failed to timely file his federal income tax returns for tax years 2008 \nthrough 2019; his State A income tax returns for tax years 2008 through 2015; and his \nState B income tax returns for tax years 2015 through 2019 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f through 1.h). On \na date not indicated in the record, he hired a tax accountant to assist him with preparing \nand filing his delinquent returns and resolving any outstanding tax obligations. (AE A; Item \n5 at 18) \nApplicant provided copies of 11 cover letters, dated August 2019, which indicated \nthat the tax accountant finalized his 2008 through 2018 federal and state returns. He also \nprovided a copy of an October 2020 cover letter, which indicated that the tax accountant \nfinalized his 2019 federal and state returns. The letters instructed Applicant to sign the \n2008 through 2016 returns and mail them to the respective federal and state agencies at \nthe addresses provided. The letters indicated that the tax accountant would file the 2017 \nthrough 2019 returns electronically upon receipt of signed authorization forms from \nApplicant. (AE A) \nThere was no evidence in the record that Applicant obtained extensions for filing \nhis 2008 through 2019 federal and state returns.

However, in his SOR answer, Applicant \nasserted that all of his delinquent tax returns had been filed. (Item 3) \nTaxes \nState A filed tax liens against Applicant for $2,551 in January 2011 (SOR \u00b6 1.b); \nand $14,839 in December 2012 (SOR \u00b6 1.a). When he contacted State A\u2019s tax agency in \nJune 2019 about the liens, Applicant was informed that they were for personal income \ntaxes associated with a former business, Company A, that he owned from 2004 through \n2009. Applicant claimed that the tax accountant referenced above discovered that \nCompany A\u2019s business accountant made a mistake on the K-1 filed for Company A in tax \nyears 2008 and 2009. Applicant also claimed that both liens were removed when his \ndelinquent returns were filed, and that no liens or delinquencies were on file with State \nA\u2019s tax agency as of 2020. However, Applicant did not provide any documents \ncorroborating his claims. (Item 3 at 2; Item 4; Item 5 at 11, 15, 16, 38; Item 6 at 5) \nAccording to the 12 cover letters referenced above, Applicant expected to receive \nrefunds for each of the federal and state returns filed for tax years 2008 through 2019, \nexcept for the following years when he expected to owe taxes: $809 to State A for tax \nyear 2009 (SOR \u00b6 1.i); and a combined $6,749 to the IRS for tax years 2018 and 2019 \n(SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.j and 1.k). Neither party proffered any documents to establish Applicant\u2019s \nactual federal and state income tax liability for tax years 2008 through 2019, including any \nrefunds received or payments made. (AE A) \nIn his SOR Answer, Applicant claimed that he paid all state and federal income \ntaxes during the years in which he had not filed a tax return; presumably based on the \nsame rationale he expressed during Interview 5 \u2013 i.e., not from direct payments to the tax \nagencies, but from his payroll deductions. He also asserted: \u201cwhen our most recent tax \naccountant got us caught up on our filings, we found that we were actually due over \n$60,000 in [refunds] dating back to 2009.\u201d He explained that he only received \u201cabout \n$8,000\u201d because he was only entitled to refunds from the prior three years. The record \ndid not indicate what happened to any refunds he may have received. (Item 3) \nRepossessions \nApplicant financed the purchase of a recreational vehicle (RV) in April 2007 with a \n$70,742 loan. A balance of $25,884 was reported on Applicant\u2019s 2017 credit report (SOR \n\u00b6 1.c). The last activity on the account was reportedly May 2012. When Applicant \ncontacted the creditor in June 2019, he was informed that the balance was the amount \ndue after the RV was sold at auction following a repossession. The creditor told him that \nhe could repay the full amount via a payment plan, or settle it via a one-time lump sum \n$14,000 payment. Applicant acknowledged that he never made any payments following \nthe June 2019 conversation due to the possibility of unemployment in connection with his \nsecurity clearance adjudication. In his SOR answer, he indicated that he considered the \ndebt resolved because it no longer appeared on a credit report he reviewed, but did not \nprovide for the record.

Applicant negotiated a settlement with \nthe original creditor for a lump-sum payment of $2,500 on July 1, 2019, which he paid on \nJuly 5, 2019. (Item 5 at 17, 17a, 17b, 38; Item 6 at 6) \nApplicant attributed the RV and ATV repossessions to being unable to make \npayments on the loans due to not having income in 2013.

He did not \nproffer any documents concerning his relevant income and expense history or his ability \nto repay his debts. His SCA revealed one period of unemployment from May 2017 through \nAugust 2017. During Interview 2, Applicant reported that his income decreased by \n$48,000 between 2009 and 2015. During that period, he juggled three part-time jobs: 1) \nself-employment with Company A, from May 2004 through July 2009; 2) self-employment \nwith another company he owned (Company B), from February 2009 through February \n2016; and 3) employment with an individual employer, from March 2011 through June \n2015. (Item 4; Item 5 at 4, 5, 8, 11, 38) \nFor some unspecified period, Applicant co-owned Company A with two friends who \neventually bought him out. He stated that the buyout occurred over the course of one to \nthree years, and that he received approximately $3,000 per month from the buyout. \nHowever, he did not specify the total amount of the buyout, or what happened to any \nfunds he received. He maintained that Company B had no profit. Applicant travelled to \nMexico for tourism for six to ten days in June 2016. The record did not indicate how that \ntrip was funded.

The loan\u2019s monthly payment was $2,400. After \nApplicant defaulted on the loan, the lender foreclosed on the loan in 2013 (SOR \u00b6 1.e). \n(Item 5 at 8-9) \nApplicant did not address the foreclosure in his SOR answer. However, he \ndiscussed the following facts and circumstances of the foreclosure during Interview 1. In \nabout 2012, Applicant contacted his lender to request a loan modification. Although he \ndid not specify a reason for the request, he mentioned that an appraisal of his home (in \nconnection with a business-related loan) revealed that his mortgage loan was underwater. \nAn agent for the lender told Applicant that they could not proceed with the loan \nmodification until he was 90 days behind on his loan payments. After he stopped making \npayments and was 90 days behind, Applicant called his lender again, but was told by \nanother agent that he could be no more than 30 days behind. So, he made payments on \nhis account to bring it back to 30 days behind only to be told by another agent that he had \nto be 90 days behind.

He maintained that he was unable to obtain any \ncorroborating documentation. The Government proffered a document that did not resolve \nthe issue of whether there was a deficiency balance. The loan did not appear on his 2017 \ncredit report. (Item 5 at 38; Items 6, 7) \nPolicies \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d (Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988)). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d (Egan at 527). \nThe President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant \napplicants eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d (EO 10865 \u00a7 2) \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the AG. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, \nrecognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies these \nguidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available and reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d (EO 10865 \u00a7 \n7). Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant has \nnot met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established \nfor issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. (Egan, 484 U.S. at 531). \u201cSubstantial \nevidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d (See v. Washington \nMetro.

Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. (Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15). An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. (ISCR Case No. 02-31154 \nat 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005)) \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d (ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002)). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if\nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d (Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; AG \u00b6 2(b)) \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline F (Financial Considerations) \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . . .  \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. (ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012)) \nThe record evidence established the following disqualifying conditions (DC) under \nthis guideline: AG \u00b6 19(b) (unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do \nso); AG \u00b6 19(c) (a history of not meeting financial obligations); and AG \u00b6 19(f) (failure to \nfile or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income tax returns or failure to pay \nannual Federal, state, or local income tax as required). Because they are established by \nsubstantial evidence, the DC apply to SOR allegations \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.h. \nBy contrast, because they were not established substantial evidence, the DC do \nnot apply to SOR allegations \u00b6\u00b6 1.i through 1.k.

There\nwas neither an admission by Applicant nor other evidence in the record sufficient to\nestablish the actual amount of taxes due to State A or the IRS or that those taxes\nremained unpaid, as alleged. Accordingly, I find SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.i though 1.k in Applicant\u2019s\nfavor.  \n \n \n \n \n \nHaving considered all of the factors set forth in AG \u00b6 20 that could mitigate the \nconcern under this guideline, I find the following relevant: \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \nAG \u00b6 20(g): the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nApplicant is credited with paying two unalleged utility accounts in June 2019, \nnegotiating a settlement agreement in June 2019 for the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.c, and \nengaging the services of a tax accountant to assist with his tax compliance obligations. \nWhile accounting mistakes in 2008 and 2009, and a lack of income in 2013, could be \ndeemed circumstances beyond his control, Applicant did not provide sufficient evidence \nto establish them as such. He also did not sufficiently develop how his period of \nunderemployment between 2009 and 2015 may have affected his ability to meet his \nfinancial obligations. Without documentary proof, I am unable to conclude that the tax \nliens alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b have been resolved. Applicant neither paid the debt \nalleged in SOR \u00b6 1.c, nor established that he is no longer legally liable for repayment. \nThe mere disappearance of a debt from a credit report does not establish that the debt \nwas either paid or forgiven. Unpaid debts are routinely removed from credit reports after \nseven years. \nApplicant paid the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.d in July 2019, well before the issuance \nof the SOR and within a reasonable timeframe of when he was placed on notice that it \nwas delinquent and a security concern. Thus, I find SOR \u00b6 1.d in his favor. \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \nThe record did not establish that a deficiency balance remained on the mortgage \nloan underlying the foreclosure alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.e. Thus, the concern is not with the \nforeclosure itself, but with the facts and circumstances surrounding it. The record \nsuggests that Applicant strategically defaulted on the loan despite having the means to \npay it. His decision not to pay the loan because he was frustrated with the manner in \nwhich the lender handled his loan modification request demonstrates a willingness to \nprioritize his own self-interest above his obligations, which casts doubt as to whether he \nmay also act similarly in the context of his security obligations. \nBecause the facts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f through 1.h are based upon Applicant\u2019s \nself-report, his self-report that they were filed as of the date he answered the SOR carries \nmore weight. Thus, I find that Applicant\u2019s 2008 through 2018 federal and state tax returns \nwere filed sometime between August 2019 and August 2021; and his 2019 return \nbetween October 2020 and August 2021. Given that there is no evidence that Applicant \nwas granted any filing extensions, I find that none of the returns were timely filed. \nApplicant\u2019s only explanation for his extended period of delinquent returns was a \nbare assertion that he and his wife \u201csimply found [them]selves overwhelmed and did not \nfile.\u201d His failure to timely file his returns for 12 tax years without a justifiable excuse does \nnot demonstrate responsible action and calls into question his suitability for access to \nclassified information. A person who fails repeatedly to fulfill his or her legal obligations, \nsuch as filing income tax returns when due, does not demonstrate the high degree of \ngood judgment and reliability required of those granted access to classified information. \n(See ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015)). \u201cFailure to file income tax \nreturns suggests that an applicant has a problem with complying with well-established \ngovernment rules and systems. Voluntary compliance with such rules and systems is \nessential for protecting classified information.\u201d (ISCR Case No. 01-05340 at 3 (App. Bd. \nDec. 20, 2002)). \nIn light of the record as a whole, Applicant\u2019s indebtedness and his repeated failure \nto timely file tax returns call into question his suitability for access to classified information. \nI am left with doubts about Applicant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and judgment. AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n20(a) and 20(b) do not apply. The partial applications of AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(d) and 20(g) do not \nsuffice to mitigate the ongoing Guideline F concerns. \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 15: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes.

Arguably, the seven-year reporting window applied to his returns for tax years 2010 \nthrough 2016. And, his 2017 through 2019 returns were not yet due to be filed, and thus, \nnot reportable. Therefore, I have construed the reference to any non-reportable years as \nan inadvertent drafting error. Even if the non-reportable years were referenced \nintentionally, then I would find the portion of SOR \u00b6 2.a referencing those years in \nApplicant\u2019s favor. \nBecause the falsification allegation is controverted, the Government has the \nburden of proving it. An omission, standing alone, does not prove a deliberate falsification. \nAn administrative judge must consider the record evidence as a whole to determine an \napplicant\u2019s state of mind at the time of the omission. An applicant\u2019s level of education and \nbusiness experience are relevant to determining whether a failure to disclose information \non a security clearance application was deliberate. \nApplicant knew that he had not filed any federal or state returns in at least the \nseven reportable years preceding the date that he certified his November 2017 SCA. Yet, \nhe answered \u201cno\u201d to a plain-language question about it on his SCA. It is doubtful that the \nomission was a simple mistake in light of the record as a whole, including his business \nexperience. I find substantial evidence of an intent by Applicant to omit security-significant \nfacts from his SCA. Therefore, AG \u00b6 16(a) is established. \n12 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nHaving considered all of the factors set forth in AG \u00b6 17 that could mitigate the \nconcern under this guideline, I find the following relevant: \nAG \u00b6 17(a): the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the \nomission, concealment, or falsification before being confronted with the \nfacts; and \nAG \u00b6 17(c): the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the \nbehavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances \nthat it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's \nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. \nAn applicant's completion of a security questionnaire is the initial step in requesting \na security clearance and the investigative process is contingent upon the honesty of the \napplicant. The Appeal Board has explained that beginning with an applicant\u2019s responses \nin the application, \nThe security clearance investigation is not a forum for an applicant to split \nhairs or parse the truth narrowly. The Federal Government has a compelling \ninterest in protecting and safeguarding classified information. That \ncompelling interest includes the government's legitimate interest in being \nable to make sound decisions (based on complete and accurate \ninformation) about who will be granted access to classified information. An \napplicant who deliberately fails to give full, frank, and candid answers to the \ngovernment in connection with a security clearance investigation or \nadjudication interferes with the integrity of the industrial security program. \n(ISCR Case No. 01-03132 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 8, 2002)) \nNot only did Applicant omit information about his delinquent returns from his SCA, \nbut he also failed to avail himself of the opportunity to voluntarily disclose it during the first \nfour of his five security clearance interviews between November 2018 and July 2019. By \nNovember 2018, he had not filed a tax return in ten years; and by July 2019, eleven years. \nIt is unlikely that this extended period of noncompliance with his tax filing obligation would \nhave escaped his mind not only while he completed his SCA, but also throughout four \nseparate interviews, during which the topics of state tax liens, his financial record, and \nother SCA omissions were discussed. \nWhen Applicant finally disclosed the information during Interview 5, he did so only \nin response to a question asking him why his state tax liens had not been offset by federal \nrefunds. Further undermining mitigation was his omission of the other derogatory financial \ninformation that was reportable on his SCA. Although those omissions were not alleged \nin the SOR, they remain relevant in this context. \nIt is implausible that Applicant reasonably believed that his finances were in \nexcellent condition prior to being confronted during Interview 1. Regardless of whether he \nhad been aware of his specific debts, he should have recalled that he lost his RV, ATV, \nand home after defaulting on the associated loans due to nonpayment.

I did \nnot find credible Applicant\u2019s explanations for answering \u201cno\u201d to all of the financial record \nquestions on his SCA, especially about his delinquent returns. I have doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and judgment. Thus, I cannot conclude that he has \nmitigated the Guideline E concerns. AG \u00b6\u00b6 17(a) and 17(c) do not apply. \nWhole-Person Analysis \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether the granting or continuing \nof national security eligibility is clearly consistent with the interests of national security \nmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nadjudicative guidelines, each of which is to be evaluated in the context of the whole \nperson. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors \nlisted at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation\nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct;\n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the\nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nI have incorporated my comments under Guidelines F and E in my whole-person \nanalysis, and I have considered the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). After weighing the disqualifying \nand mitigating conditions under Guidelines F and E, and evaluating all the evidence in \nthe context of the whole person, I conclude that Applicant has not mitigated the security \nconcerns raised by his indebtedness, failure to timely file federal and state income tax \nreturns over an extended period, and deliberate falsification of his SCA. Accordingly, \nApplicant has not carried his burden of showing that it is clearly consistent with the \ninterests of national security to grant him eligibility for access to classified information. \n14 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by Section \nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.c:  \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.d: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.e \u2013 1.h: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.i \u2013 1.k: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:   \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the interests of national security to \ngrant or continue Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.

She is not incurring any new \ndebts. Applicant\u2019s regular monthly expenses include her rent of $1,500 monthly, her car \npayment of $439, car insurance is $129, food is $200. If she does not work overtime, at \nthe end of the month after paying her regular monthly expenses she has about $100 left \nin discretionary funds. (Tr. p. 42.) She has no savings account. (Tr. p. 43.) She has \nabout $5,000 in her company\u2019s 401(k). She is currently looking for a second job to help \nher address her delinquent debts. She also hopes to enroll in college and further her \neducation to get promoted at work. (Tr. p. 45.) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance \ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to \npotential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F -  Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for Financial Considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. Three are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; and  \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations, and \nApplicant has a long history of financial hardship. Her actions or inactions both \ndemonstrate a history of not addressing her debt and an inability to do so. The evidence \nis sufficient to raise the above disqualifying conditions. \nThe following mitigating conditions under the Financial Considerations are \npotentially applicable under AG \u00b6 20. \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g. loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce, or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and  \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \nIt is noted that Applicant went through a divorce that probably caused some \nfinancial difficulties. However, Applicant testified that the debts listed in the SOR were \nher debts, not her ex-husband\u2019s, and that she incurred them after the divorce. Applicant \nstates that she has recently directed her focus at resolving his delinquent debts. \nHowever, she has not yet started the process. Applicant\u2019s financial irresponsibility and \ninaction for so long casts doubt on her current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment. At this time, Applicant needs time to show the Government that she will \ncontinue to properly resolve her financial delinquencies with regular systematic \npayments and consistency. None of the mitigating conditions are applicable. \nThere is insufficient evidence in the record to show that Applicant\u2019s delinquent \ndebts have been resolved. Overall, Applicant shows no progress towards resolving her \ndebts. She owes a significant amount of money to her creditors that she obviously \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ncannot afford to pay. There is insufficient evidence in the record to show that the \nApplicant has carried her burden of proof to establish mitigation of the government \nsecurity concerns under Guideline F. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nIn the event that \nApplicant follows through with her commitment to show financial responsibility, \nsometime in the future she may be found to be sufficiently reliable to properly protect \nand access classified information. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nrelevant facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I conclude Applicant has not \nmitigated the Financial Considerations security concern. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a.  through 1.y. \nAgainst Applicant \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for \na security clearance.

(AE F-H, N) \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe security concern for drug involvement and substance misuse is set out in AG \n\u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d \nas defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term \nadopted in this guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 25. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); and \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \nApplicant possessed and used marijuana, cocaine, Adderall, and narcotic \npainkillers. Marijuana and cocaine are illegal controlled substances. Adderall and \nnarcotic painkillers are available with a prescription, but Applicant obtained them without \na prescription. He was cited in 2009 and 2010 for possession of drug paraphernalia and \npossession of marijuana. AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a) and 25(c) are applicable. \nAG \u00b6 26 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following \nare potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \nand \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; \nand \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility.  \nThere is no evidence of any illegal drug use after March 2020, and there is no \nreason to disbelieve Applicant. However, his illegal drug use involved multiple drugs \nover an extended period, and it did not end until shortly before he started his current \nposition. It is sometimes easy to forget, particularly for drugs like Adderall and \nmarijuana, that Applicant committed a crime every time he possessed and used \ncontrolled substances. There are no bright-line rules for determining when conduct is \nrecent, and Applicant\u2019s disregard of the law remains troubling. AG \u00b6 2(b) requires that \n\u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security eligibility will \nbe resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nApplicant\u2019s history of illegal drug use continues to cast doubt on his current \nreliability, trustworthiness, good judgment, and willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. The above mitigating conditions, individually or collectively, are \ninsufficient to alleviate those concerns. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline H in my whole-person analysis. I also considered \nApplicant\u2019s favorable character evidence. Applicant appears to have moved on to the \nnext phase of his life, which does not involve illegal drugs. If he continues on his present \ncourse, a security clearance could be in his future, but that time is not yet here. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant did not \nmitigate the security concerns under Guideline H (drug involvement and substance \nmisuse). \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.d: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.e: \nWithdrawn \nSubparagraph 1.f: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.g: \nWithdrawn \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \na security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nEdward W. Loughran \nAdministrative Judge \n7 \n",

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \nApplicant has a history of failing to pay his state income taxes. The evidence is \nsufficient to raise the above disqualifying conditions. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred\nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast\ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment;  \n \n \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control;   \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and  \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements.  \nApplicant\u2019s aforementioned divorces, unemployment, and underemployment \nwere beyond his control. Applicant\u2019s poor money management, lack of awareness of his \nfinances, and reliance upon his ex-spouse to file and pay his state taxes were within his \ncontrol. \nWith respect to the SOR debts, there is no documentary evidence of payments to \nor payment arrangements with the relevant state taxing authority. It is reasonable to \nexpect Applicant to present documentation about the resolution of specific debts. See, \ne.g., ISCR Case No. 15-03363 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 16, 2016). Applicant stated that he \nintends to pay the SOR debts. However, intentions to pay debts in the future are not a \nsubstitute for a track record of debt repayment or other responsible approaches. See \nISCR Case No. 11-14570 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 23, 2013). \nThere is insufficient evidence for a determination that Applicant\u2019s financial \nproblems will be resolved within a reasonable period of time. He has owed the SOR \ndebts for about a decade. Despite having hired a tax consultant, there is insufficient \nevidence that he is resolving his delinquent state tax debt. Without corroborating \ndocumentation detailing his efforts to make payment arrangements or payments with his \nstate taxing authority, I am unable to find that he acted responsibly under the \ncircumstances or that he made a good-faith effort to pay his debts. While he ultimately \npaid off at least some of his delinquent federal taxes, he failed to pay several other \nsignificant charged-off debts that were not listed in the SOR. His financial issues are \nongoing. They continue to cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good \njudgment. Financial considerations security concerns are not mitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant did not \nmitigate the financial considerations security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \na security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nBenjamin R. Dorsey \nAdministrative Judge \n6 \n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact In Applicant\u2019s SOR response, she admitted all of the allegations in SOR (\u00b6\u00b6 1.a, through 1.h). Her admissions are accepted as findings of fact. Applicant is a 28-year-old employee of a DOD contractor who has worked for this employer since February 2019. Her job title is aircraft modification electrician. She served in the Army National Guard from December 2010 until January 2019, when she received an honorable discharge. She earned an associate\u2019s degree in 2019. She has held a DOD security clearance since 2011. She was married in 2013, and has an 8-year-old son with special needs. (Tr. 10-11, 21; GE 1) Financial Considerations The SOR alleges eight delinquent debts totaling approximately $51,700.

Guideline F (financial considerations) security concerns are \nnot mitigated. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn July 28, 2020, Applicant completed her Questionnaires for Investigations \nProcessing or security clearance application (SCA). (Government Exhibit (GE) 1) On April \n30, 2021, the Department of Defense (DOD) Consolidated Adjudications Facility (CAF) \nissued a statement of reasons (SOR) to Applicant under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) \n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960); DOD \nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(Directive) (January 2, 1992), as amended; and Security Executive Agent Directive 4, \nestablishing in Appendix A the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining \nEligibility for Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position \n(AGs), effective June 8, 2017.  \nThe SOR detailed reasons why the DOD CAF did not find under the Directive that \nit is clearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant or continue a security \nclearance for Applicant and recommended referral to an administrative judge to \ndetermine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. \nSpecifically, the SOR set forth security concerns arising under Guideline F. On May 11, \n\n \n2 \n                                         \n \n2021, Applicant provided two documents with her response to the SOR, and she \nrequested a hearing.   \n \nOn September 7, 2021, Department Counsel was ready to proceed. On September \n17, 2021, the case was assigned to me. On March 9, 2022, the Defense Office of \nHearings and Appeals issued a Notice setting the hearing date for April 5, 2022. Her \nhearing was held as scheduled using the DOD Microsoft Teams video teleconference \nsystem.      \n \nDuring the hearing, Department Counsel offered 6 exhibits; Applicant did not offer \nany exhibits, but I labeled the two documents provided with her SOR response as \nApplicant Exhibit (AE) A and B; and all proffered exhibits were admitted into evidence \nwithout objection. I held the record open for two weeks in the event either party wanted \nto supplement the record with additional documentation, but no other documents were \nsubmitted. On April 13, 2022, DOHA received a copy of the transcript (Tr.).  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s SOR response, she admitted all of the allegations in SOR (\u00b6\u00b6 1.a, \nthrough 1.h). Her admissions are accepted as findings of fact. \n \nApplicant is a 28-year-old employee of a DOD contractor who has worked for this \nemployer since February 2019. Her job title is aircraft modification electrician. She served \nin the Army National Guard from December 2010 until January 2019, when she received \nan honorable discharge. She earned an associate\u2019s degree in 2019. She has held a DOD \nsecurity clearance since 2011. She was married in 2013, and has an 8-year-old son with \nspecial needs. (Tr. 10-11, 21; GE 1) \n \nFinancial Considerations \n \nThe SOR alleges eight delinquent debts totaling approximately $51,700. The \nmajority of the debt is from two repossessed vehicles in the amount of $48,372, with the \nmost recent vehicle purchased in 2020 and repossessed shortly thereafter. (\u00b6\u00b6 1.f and \n1.h) Applicant stated that she suffered financial issues after she received a significant cut \nin pay after she was required to move for her job in February 2021. In addition, she was \nunemployed for a period of time taking care of her disabled son and step-father. Her \ncurrent annual salary is $88,100, and her husband\u2019s salary is approximately $54,000.  \nBeginning in June 2022, her husband will be earning approximately $95,000 annually with \nhis new employer. (Tr. 59; GE 2, GE 6) \n \nIn September 2020, Applicant participated in a background interview with a DOD \ninvestigator. Her delinquent debts were discussed and she stated that she was catching \nup on the overdue bills, and that some of the outstanding accounts from her credit report \nwere being disputed. (GE 6) \n \nApplicant lived with her parents from June 2013 to April 2019. She testified that \nshe and her spouse suffered financial problems beginning in 2017, when she attended \n\n \n3 \n                                         \n \ncollege full-time until 2019. During this two-year period, she took care of their disabled \nson during the day, worked part-time, and her husband\u2019s hours were reduced from his \nemployer. These circumstances caused them financial issues and they were unable to \npay all of their bills. (Tr. 21-25, 28-29, 54-55; GE 1) \n \nApplicant was hired by her current employer in February 2019. At the request of \nher employer, she moved from State A to live a month or two in State B to establish \nresidency, and then she returned to State A for her employment duties. Her move \nincreased her salary by 15% and she received a monthly housing stipend of about $3,000. \nShe believed that she would stay in State A for the next decade, but the pandemic hit the \ncountry, and in about December 2020, her employer notified her that she would return to \nState B in about February 2021. Upon her return to State B, Applicant lost the 15% pay \nincrease and the $3,000 monthly housing stipend, which negatively impacted her \nfinances. (Tr. 13, 21-25, 28-29, 54-55; GE 1) \n \nThe SOR includes the following financial allegations:  \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.a alleges Applicant is indebted for an unpaid medical account in the \namount of $662. Applicant stated that the insurance paid this medical bill and she was \ndisputing the account. Department Counsel asked her if she could provide supporting \ndocumentation while I held the record open for two weeks, and Applicant agreed. No \ndocumentation was submitted and this debt remains unresolved. (Tr. 32, 58; GE 6)    \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.b alleges a charged-off Bank of America account in the amount of $783. \nApplicant testified that this was a credit card that became delinquent in 2017. The creditor \nrecently offered a settlement of $200 to resolve the outstanding balance, and she is \ncurrently working on paying that settlement. Department Counsel asked her to provide \nsupporting documentation if she settled the account while the record was held open, and \nApplicant agreed. No documentation was submitted and this debt remains unresolved \n(Tr. 34-37, 61)  \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c and 1.d allege two unpaid accounts with Credit One Bank, one account \nis $100 past due with a balance of $630, and the second account is delinquent in the \namount of $545. Applicant stated that she is in the process of paying the first account, \nand the second account remains unpaid. She agreed to submit documentation while the \nrecord was held open, but she failed to provide any. Both accounts remain unresolved. \n(Tr. 38-39, 61-62; SOR response at 3; AE 2-3)  \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.e alleges a charged-off account with Suncoast Credit Union in the amount \nof $489. Applicant stated that she contacted the creditor to see if she could settle the \naccount, or arrange a payment plan. She had not received a response from the creditor \nas of the date of the hearing. This account remains unresolved. (Tr. 42-43) \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.f alleges a delinquent account with American Credit Union in the amount \nof $27,059, the balance due after a vehicle was repossessed in about February 2021. \nApplicant stated that this was for her motorcycle. When she received notification from her \nemployer that she would be relocated in State B, she voluntarily called the bank to have \n\n \n4 \n                                         \n \nthe motorcycle repossessed. At the hearing, she claimed that the motorcycle was \nauctioned and the proceeds paid the outstanding balance in full. Department Counsel \nrequested supporting documentation be submitted while the record was held open, and \nApplicant agreed. No documentation was submitted and this account has not been \nresolved. (Tr. 25-29, 61; AE 4) \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.g alleges a delinquent account with Fingerhut Webbank in the amount of \n$216. Applicant testified that she had contacted the creditor to see if a settlement could \nbe arranged, or set-up a payment plan, but as of the date of the hearing, she had not \nheard from the creditor. No post-hearing documentation concerning the status of this \naccount was received. This account remains unresolved. (Tr. 42-43) \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.h alleges a delinquent account with Chrysler Capital in the amount of \n$21,313, the balance due after a vehicle was repossessed in about October 2017. \nApplicant stated that the document provided with her SOR response, a single page taken \nfrom a credit report, showed that Chrysler Capital sold the account to another agency and \nthe balance reflected a zero. Applicant claimed that the loan balance of $21,313 was the \ntotal loan balance, and not the actual amount of approximately $4,000 owed after the \nvehicle was repossessed and later auctioned. She also stated that she had not been \ncontacted by a collection agency pursuing the deficit loan balance. Department Counsel \nrequested supporting documentation be submitted while the record was held open, and \nApplicant agreed. No documentation was submitted to support her claims. This account \nhas not been resolved.  (Tr. 43-44, 50-51; AE A) \n \nApplicant stated that she and her spouse have worked with a debt resolution \nagency in the past, but for \u201cwhatever reason\u201d, they were dropped from the program. The \ndebt agency\u2019s repayment schedule attached to her SOR response showed that the debts \nalleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.c, and 1.g were the same amount as alleged in the SOR or \nhigher. Applicant testified that they are currently working with a new debt resolution \nagency. She participated in financial counseling classes with her current bank, through \nher employer, and she also took personal finance courses while attending college. \nApplicant offered to send supporting documentation to show that she was working with \nthe debt resolution agency to pay off their debts. She also stated that when her husband \nreturns to State B in June 2022, he will be employed at a new job with a significantly \nhigher salary. He is currently enrolled in school and their son will complete his school in \nJune 2022. Department Counsel asked Applicant to provide a monthly budget, to show \nher current status, and also a monthly budget that incorporates her husband\u2019s anticipated \nearnings. Applicant did not provide any documentation. (AE A; Tr. 39, 45-46, 49-52, 56-\n57, 65-68)  \n \nApplicant stated that their son is significantly disabled and has been through 86 \nsurgeries to date. State A paid for his medical care until she was hired by her current \nemployer in February 2019. Her employer\u2019s insurance now covers almost all of his \nmedical costs, so they have \u201cminimal copays\u201d for their son\u2019s medical care. (Tr. 57-58) \n \nApplicant and her spouse received approximately a $3,000 to $4,000 federal tax \nrefund last year. She used the money to move to State B. She also admitted that her \n\n \n5 \n                                         \n \nemployer provided her a moving stipend, but it did not cover \u201cdeposits\u201d she was required \nto pay in State B.  She also received this year\u2019s tax refund of approximately $14,000. She \nused the money to pay some late car payments and about $5,000 of unpaid medical \nexpenses. She admitted that despite the April 2021 SOR putting her on notice of the \nGovernment\u2019s concerns about her financial issues, she did not use any money from their \ncombined 2020 and 2021 tax refunds totaling over $17,000 to voluntarily pay, settle, or \nresolve any of the debts alleged in the SOR, which included six accounts under $800. (Tr. \n59-61, 64-66) \n \nApplicant admitted upon questioning that she had a delinquent account with \nVerizon in the amount of approximately $3,000. This debt developed after they left \nVerizon in January 2021, and the balance owed is for the devices that they kept. This \ndebt is not resolved. She did not think to mention this debt when specifically asked if she \nhad any other outstanding delinquent debts because she thought this debt was already \nalleged in the SOR. Applicant purchased a 2020 vehicle and has a $600 monthly car \npayment, and her husband has a 2019 vehicle with a $500 monthly payment. She claimed \nthat she could not get a used vehicle with a lower monthly payment due to her poor credit \nscore. (Tr. 59-64, 68-71; AE B) \n \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The President \nhas authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicant\u2019s eligibility for \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended.  \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable.  \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Clearance \ndecisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \n\n \n6 \n                                         \n \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \nThus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that it is based, in whole or \nin part, on any express or implied determination about applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or \npatriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the \nPresident, Secretary of Defense, and Director of National Intelligence have established \nfor issuing a clearance. \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 \n(App. Bd. May 2, 1996). \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his [or her] security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of \ndisproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nFinancial Considerations \n \nAG \u00b6 18 articulates the security concern for financial problems: \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.    \n \nThe Appeal Board explained the scope and rationale for the financial \nconsiderations security concern in ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) \n(citation omitted) as follows: \n \n\n \n7 \n                                         \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might \nknowingly compromise classified information in order to raise money in \nsatisfaction of his or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the \ntotality of an applicant\u2019s financial history and circumstances. The Judge \nmust consider pertinent evidence regarding the applicant\u2019s self-control, \njudgment, and other qualities essential to protecting the national secrets as \nwell as the vulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive \npresumes a nexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines \nand an applicant\u2019s security eligibility. \n \n  \nAG \u00b6 19 includes disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern and \nmay be disqualifying in this case: \u201c(a) inability to satisfy debts\u201d; and \u201c(c) a history of not \nmeeting financial obligations.\u201d    \n \n  \nIn ISCR Case No. 08-12184 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan. 7, 2010), the Appeal Board \nexplained: \n \nIt is well-settled that adverse information from a credit report can normally \nmeet the substantial evidence standard and the government\u2019s obligations \nunder [Directive] \u00b6 E3.1.14 for pertinent allegations. At that point, the burden \nshifts to applicant to establish either that [he or] she is not responsible for \nthe debt or that matters in mitigation apply. \n \n(internal citation omitted). The SOR alleges eight delinquent debts totaling approximately \n$51,700. The majority of the debt is from two repossessed vehicles in the amount of \n$48,372, with the most recent vehicle purchased in 2020 and repossessed shortly \nthereafter. The record establishes the disqualifying conditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c), \nrequiring additional inquiry about the possible applicability of mitigating conditions. \nDiscussion of the disqualifying conditions is contained in the mitigation section, infra.  \n \nThe financial considerations mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are as follows:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n \n\n \n8 \n                                         \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n  \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \n \nApplicant described several circumstances beyond her control, which adversely \naffected her finances. In December 2020, she received an unexpected notice from her \nemployer that she needed to move to State B in February 2021. This move caused her \nto lose her $3,000 monthly housing stipend and reduced her salary by 15%. Another \ncircumstance beyond her control is her disabled son who requires intensive medical care \nand therapy. Since February 2019, she has been responsible for paying the medical co-\npayments not covered by insurance. Some of the factors adversely affecting her finances; \nhowever, were within her control, such as choosing to reduce her employment to part-\ntime while attending college full-time. She admitted that from 2013 to early 2019, she and \nher spouse lived with her parents. However, \u201c[e]ven if applicant\u2019s financial difficulties \ninitially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances outside his [or her] control, the \njudge could still consider whether applicant has since acted in a reasonable manner when \ndealing with those financial difficulties.\u201d ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. Bd. Jan. \n12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 03-13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005); ISCR Case No. \n99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, \n1999)).    \n \nThere is no requirement that an applicant immediately resolve all financial issues \nor make payments on all delinquent debts simultaneously. Rather, a reasonable plan and \ngood-faith efforts to pay delinquent debts, or resolution of such issues, one at a time, is \nsufficient. An applicant\u2019s mere promises to pay debts in the future, without further \nconfirmed action, are inadequate. \n \nAn administrative judge is \u201crequired to examine all the circumstances surrounding \nthe debts and their eventual satisfaction\u201d including the timing of any settlements, \napplicant\u2019s salary for the past several years, and whether a debt or debts \u201chad already \nbeen reduced to judgment.\u201d ISCR Case No. 20-01656 at 5 (App. Bd. Mar. 31, 2022) (citing \nISCR Case No. 03-04704 at 4 (App. Bd. Sep. 21, 2005)). The Appeal Board has noted, \n\u201can applicant who resolves financial problems after being placed on notice his or her \nsecurity clearance may be in jeopardy may lack the judgment and self-discipline to follow \nrules and regulations over time or when there is no immediate threat to his [or her] own \ninterests.\u201d ISCR Case No. 17-01213 (App. Bd. June 29, 2018) (citing ISCR Case No. 14-\n05476 at 4 (App. Bd. Mar. 25, 2016)). \n \nApplicant did not provide a budget or other documentation about her financial \nresources or show why she was unable to make greater progress resolving her delinquent \nSOR debts before the SOR was issued. The combined salaries of her and her husband \ntotaled in the six-figure range following her employment in February 2019. At the hearing, \nshe admitted that she had not voluntarily paid, settled, or resolved any of the debts alleged \n\n \n9 \n                                         \n \nin the SOR, despite the fact that she and her spouse received tax refunds totaling \napproximately $17,000 the last two years. Her recent purchase of a newer model vehicle \nis also troubling after considering that she had two vehicles repossessed in 2017 and \n2021. There is insufficient assurance or supporting documentation in the record that her \nfinancial problems are under control and will not recur in the future. Under all the \ncircumstances, Applicant failed to establish mitigation of financial considerations security \nconcerns. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n     \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), \u201c[t]he ultimate determination\u201d of whether to grant a security \nclearance \u201cmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines\u201d and the whole-person concept. My comments under Guideline F are \nincorporated in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under those guidelines but some warrant additional comment. \n \nApplicant is a 28-year-old employee of a DOD contractor who has worked for this \nemployer since February 2019. She served in the Army National Guard from December \n2010 until January 2019, when she received an honorable discharge. In 2019, she \nreceived an associate\u2019s degree. She and her spouse have an 8-year-old son who is \nseverely disabled.   \n \nAlthough Applicant did provide some mitigating information of circumstances \nbeyond her control, the evidence against grant of a security clearance is more substantial \nat this time. She did not provide documentation about why she was unable to make \ngreater documented progress resolving any of the delinquent SOR debts. Her financial \nhistory raises unmitigated questions about her reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified information. See AG \u00b6 18.  \n \nIt is well settled that once a concern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s security \nclearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption against granting a security clearance. \nSee Dorfmont, 913 F. 2d at 1401. \u201c[A] favorable clearance decision means that the record \ndiscloses no basis for doubt about an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \n\n \n10 \n                                         \n \ninformation.\u201d ISCR Case No. 18-02085 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan. 3, 2020) (citing ISCR Case \nNo.12-00270 at 3 (App. Bd. Jan. 17, 2014)).  \n \nThis decision should not be construed as a determination that Applicant cannot or \nwill not attain the state of reform necessary for award of a security clearance in the future. \nWith more effort towards establishing a track record of financial responsibility, and a better \nrecord of behavior consistent with her obligations, she may well be able to demonstrate \npersuasive evidence of her security clearance worthiness.  \n \nI have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Egan, Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, \nthe AGs, and the Appeal Board\u2019s jurisprudence to the facts and circumstances in the \ncontext of the whole person. Applicant failed to mitigate financial considerations security \nconcerns.   \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n  \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:   \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT  \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.h: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances in this case, it is not clearly consistent with the \ninterests of national security to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n_________________________ \nPamela C. Benson \nAdministrative Judge \n",

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 \n2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national \nsecurity eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7 of Exec. Or. \n10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall \nin no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also \nExec.

Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . .. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant was unable to pay his debts. The evidence is sufficient to raise AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n19(a) and 19(c). \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConditions beyond Applicant\u2019s control contributed to his financial problems.

I find that Applicant\u2019s finances are under \ncontrol, and they do not continue to cast doubt on his judgment, trustworthiness, and \nreliability. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances \nsurrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-\nperson analysis. Overall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as \nto Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant \nmitigated the financial considerations security concerns. \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.b: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance. \nEligibility for access to classified information is granted. \nCandace Le\u2019i Garcia \nAdministrative Judge \n9 \n",

Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn June 18, 2021, the Department of Defense (DOD) Consolidated Adjudications \nFacility (CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security \nconcerns under Guideline B (foreign influence). This action was taken under Executive \nOrder (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, \n1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nadjudicative guidelines implemented by the DOD on June 8, 2017. Applicant responded \nto the SOR and requested a hearing. \nOn April 7, 2022, a notice of hearing was issued, scheduling the hearing for April \n27, 2022. The video-teleconference hearing proceeded as scheduled using Microsoft \nTeams. Department Counsel submitted three documents, which I admitted into evidence \nas Government Exhibits (GE) 1, 2, and 3, without objection. Department Counsel \n1 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nsubmitted a request for administrative notice of facts concerning the Republic of Iraq with \nsupporting documents. I admitted the entire packet as Administrative Notice (AN) I, \nwithout objection. Applicant testified but did not submit any documents. The hearing \ntranscript was received on May 4, 2022. \nFindings of Fact \nThe SOR alleges foreign influence security concerns based on Applicant\u2019s mother-\nin-law (SOR \u00b6 1.a.), sister-in-law, and four brothers-in-law (who are citizens and residents \nof Iraq). (SOR \u00b6 1.b.) In his response to SOR, Applicant admitted all of the allegations \nunder Guideline B. His admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a \ncareful review of the pleadings, hearing transcript, and exhibits, I make the following \nfindings of fact: \nApplicant is 48 years old. He was born in Mosul, Iraq, and he obtained his \nbachelor\u2019s degree in that country in 1997. He entered the United States illegally in \nDecember 2001, and he was held in a detention center by U.S. immigration until his \nhearing in May 2002. He requested political asylum at his hearing due to threats and three \ndetainments by members of the Ba\u2019ath Party, of which he was not a member. His asylum \nwas granted. Beginning in March 2007, he served in the U.S. Army National Guard as a \nmilitary translator with the rank of Specialist (E-4). He deployed to Iraq in October 2008, \nand returned to the U.S. in June 2009. He received an honorable discharge in March \n2010. He became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 2009. His current translator employment \noffer with a federal contractor is contingent based on his eligibility for a DOD security \nclearance. (GE 1, GE 2, GE 3; Tr. 18-23, 30-31, 52-53) \nApplicant was hired by a federal contractor for a linguist position in August 2006 \nand was terminated in February 2007. He told his supervisor that he needed to be moved \nto another military base in Iraq because the current base was too dangerous. His \nsupervisor told him he was needed at that base, but Applicant told him he could not stay \nthere. Applicant was fired by his employer and sent home. He was also hired by another \nfederal contractor in March 2010 to work in Iraq as a translator. He was fired by his \nemployer in August 2010, for violation of company policy and creating a hostile workplace. \nApplicant admitted he was aware that he was not to have any type of relationship with \nany foreign nationals in Iraq, but he became romantically involved with an Iraqi woman. \nThey discussed becoming engaged and eventually married. He failed to report his \nrelationship to his employer. (Tr. 53-59; GE 2, GE 3) \nIn September 2010, he travelled to Damascus, Syria after his family arranged a \nmarriage for him with an Iraqi woman. He married his new wife in Syria and sponsored \nher for a Visa to the U.S., which she entered in June 2011. When questioned by \nDepartment Counsel as to why he chose to travel to Syria to arrange a marriage with an \nIraqi woman rather than marry a U.S. citizen, Applicant stated \u201cin our culture, you have to \nmarry [someone from the same tribe].\u201d His wife is now a naturalized U.S. citizen, and they \nhave two daughters, ages seven and ten months. His wife returned to Iraq to visit family \nin 2012 and 2015. He and his wife returned to Iraq in 2017 to attend the marriage of his \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nbrother-in-law. They stayed at his mother-in-law\u2019s house. (Tr. 18-19, 24-29, 31-32, 43-44, \n58-59) \nApplicant\u2019s mother-in-law is a citizen and resident of Iraq. During his background \ninterview in October 2017, he told the authorized DOD investigator that he had contact \nwith her two times per week via telephone. He and his spouse regularly send her financial \nassistance, about $250 every three or four months. She occasionally works as a \nhousekeeper and is not affiliated with the Iraqi government or military. (Tr. 28, 36-37, 42, \n50-51) \nApplicant\u2019s spouse\u2019s two older brothers (B-in-law 1 and 2) are citizens and \nresidents of Iraq. During his background interview in October 2017, he told the authorized \nDOD investigator that he and his wife have contact with them about every two or three \nmonths. One of her brothers is employed as a soldier with the Nineveh Protection Unit \n(NPU), which is affiliated with the Iraqi military. One of his wife\u2019s younger brothers (B-in-\nlaw 3) moved to Canada and married in 2019. He is an Iraqi citizen currently residing in \nCanada. Her other younger brother (B-in-law 4) and her sister (S-in-law) are citizens and \nresidents of Iraq. Applicant reported to the investigator that he and his wife have contact \nwith these family members weekly, and they are not affiliated with any foreign government \nor military. The investigator questioned Applicant as to why he failed to list his wife\u2019s \nsiblings on the security clearance application (SCA) or during his counterintelligence (CI) \ninterview in August 2017. Applicant stated that he intentionally failed to report these \nindividuals because he did not want his security clearance investigation to take any longer \nthan necessary. (GE 1, GE 2, GE 3; Tr. 37-41) \nContact with: (M-in-law) (B-in-law 1) (B-in-law 2) (B-in-law 3) (B-in-law 4) (S-in-law) \nSCA \n8/2017 \nAnnually \nNot \nreported \nNot \nreported \nNot \nreported \nNot \nreported \nNot \nreported \nCI \ninterview \n8/2017 \nNot \nreported \nNot \nreported \nNot \nreported \nNot \nreported \nNot \nreported \nAnnually \nBkground \ninterview \n10/2017 \nTwo times \nper week \nOnce \nevery \n3 \nmonths \nOnce \nevery \n2 \nmonths \nOnce \nevery \nweek \nOnce \nevery \nweek \nOnce \nevery \nweek \nBkground \ninterview \n6/2018 \nNot \ndiscussed \nOnce \nevery \n6 \nmonths \nOnce per \nyear \nOnce \nevery \n6 \nmonths \nOnce per \nyear \nOnce \nevery six \nmonths \nApplicant was interviewed again by two DOD authorized investigators in June \n2018. There were discrepant facts reported in his previous background investigations that \nrequired additional information. During the course of the interview, the reporting \ninvestigator noticed that Applicant was getting irritable with their questions. Applicant \nrepeatedly stated that the investigators were asking too many questions. Also, on a few \noccasions, he extended his arm and pointed his finger very close to an investigator\u2019s face, \nstating in a very loud voice, \u201cYou\u2019re asking too many questions.\u201d At one point during \nquestioning, the investigator abruptly stopped the interview after Applicant got up from \nhis chair shouting and displaying aggressive behavior. Applicant was told that if he did \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nnot calm down, he would be escorted out of the facility. He was also given a ten-minute \nbreak to get his emotions under control before the interview continued. Applicant received \nthe investigative reports from both background interviews. He certified with his signature \nthat the investigative records were reported accurately. (GE 2; Tr. 46-50) \nAdministrative Notice \nI have taken administrative notice of the following facts concerning Iraq: \nThe Federal Republic of Iraq (Iraq) is a constitutional parliamentary republic. The \nU.S. Department of State warns U.S. citizens not to travel to Iraq due to terrorism and \narmed conflict. U.S. citizens in Iraq are at high risk for violence and kidnapping. Numerous \nterrorist and insurgent groups are active in Iraq and regularly attack both Iraqi security \nforces and civilians. The Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS), a designated terrorist \norganization, remains a threat to public safety in Iraq. Additionally, criminal gangs and \nlocal militia pose a potential threat to U.S. citizens. In February 2018, the U.S. Director of \nNational Intelligence (DNI) concluded that, given the ongoing presence of ISIS and Iran-\nsupported militants, Iraq will likely face a lengthy period of political turmoil and conflict. \n(AN I) \nIraq\u2019s most significant human rights abuses are largely fueled by the terrorist \nactivities of ISIS; however, some Iraqi security forces were alleged to have engaged in \nunlawful killings, disappearances and extortion, torture, life-threatening conditions in \ndetention and prison facilities, and arbitrary arrest and detention. (AN I) \nThe United States\u2019 commitment to Iraq is balanced against the inherent dangers \nof the ongoing conflict in Iraq to its citizens and residents from terrorists and significant \nhuman rights issues. (AN 1) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 6 as follows: \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they result \nin divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern if they \ncreate circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or induced \nto help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way \ninconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to pressure \nor coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign contacts and \ninterests should consider the country in which the foreign contact or interest \nis located, including, but not limited to, considerations such as whether it is \nknown to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or sensitive information or \nis associated with a risk of terrorism. \nTwo disqualifying conditions under this guideline (AG \u00b6 7) are relevant to this case: \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s \ndesire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing that \ninformation or technology. \n\u201cThe United States has a compelling interest in protecting and safeguarding \n[sensitive] information from any person, organization, or country that is not authorized to \nhave access to it, regardless of whether that person, organization, or country has interests \ninimical to those of the United States.\u201d ISCR Case No. 02-11570 at 5 (App. Bd. May 19, \n2004). \nThe mere possession of close family ties with relatives living in Iraq is not, as a \nmatter of law, disqualifying under Guideline B. However, if an applicant or his or her \nspouse has such a relationship with even one person living in a foreign country, this factor \nalone is sufficient to create the potential for foreign influence and could potentially result \nin the compromise of classified information. See ISCR Case No. 08-02864 at 4-5 (App. \nBd. Dec. 29, 2009) (discussing problematic visits of applicant\u2019s father to Iran). \nTo establish AG \u00b6 7(a), the Government must demonstrate a \u201cheightened risk\u201d of \nexploitation due to Applicant\u2019s contacts with his spouse\u2019s family members in Iraq, one \nwho is employed by the NPU, a unit in the Iraqi military. Given the activities of the Iraqi \ngovernment, terrorists, and significant human rights violations, I find the Government has \nestablished the requisite \u201cheightened risk\u201d and potential conflict of interest regarding \nApplicant\u2019s contacts with family members in Iraq. AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a), and 7(b) apply. \nThe following mitigating conditions under this guideline (AG \u00b6 8) are potentially \nrelevant: \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which \nthese persons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in \nthat country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a \nposition of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, \ngroup, organization, or government and the interests of the United States; \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest; and \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation. \nNot every foreign contact or tie presents the heightened risk under AG \u00b6 7(a). The \n\u201cheightened risk\u201d denotes a risk greater than the normal risk inherent in having a family \nmember or a spouse\u2019s family member living under a foreign government. The nature and \nstrength of the family ties or other foreign interests and the country involved (i.e., the \nnature of its government, its relationship with the United States, and its human rights \nrecord) are relevant in assessing whether there is a likelihood of vulnerability to \ngovernment coercion. The risk of coercion, persuasion, or duress is significantly greater \nif the foreign country has an authoritarian government; a family member is associated \nwith, or dependent on, the foreign government; or the country is known to conduct \nintelligence operations against the United States. In considering the nature of the foreign \ngovernment, the administrative judge must take into account any terrorist activity in the \ncountry at issue. See generally ISCR Case No. 02-26130 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 7, 2006). \nThere is a rebuttable presumption that a person has ties of affection for, or \nobligation to, his or her immediate family members, and this presumption includes in-\nlaws. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 07-06030 at 3 (App. Bd. Jun. 19, 2008); ISCR Case No. \n05-00939 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 3, 2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 01-03120 at 4 (App. Bd. \nFeb. 20, 2002).   \nApplicant has regular contact with his spouse\u2019s family members living in Iraq, and \nhe has frequent contact with his mother-in-law, sister-in-law, and a younger brother-in-\nlaw living in that country. Applicant and his spouse were born in Iraq, and he has a \nbrother-in-law who is serving in the NPU, a unit in the Iraqi military. Applicant and his \nspouse provide financial support to his mother-in-law. Their financial support, trips, and \nfrequent contacts with relatives in Iraq are manifestations of their care and concern for \nrelatives living in that country. \nI considered the totality of Applicant\u2019s ties to Iraq, the nature of its government, its \nrelationship with the United States, and its human rights record, all of which are relevant \nin assessing the likelihood that an applicant\u2019s family members are vulnerable to \ngovernment coercion. Applicant\u2019s extended family members in Iraq \u201ccould be a means \nthrough which Applicant comes to the attention of those who seek U.S. information or \ntechnology and who would attempt to exert coercion upon him.\u201d ADP Case No. 14-01655 \nat 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 9, 2015) (citing ISCR Case No. 14-02950 at 3 (App. Bd. May 14, \n2015)). His relationships with relatives who are living in Iraq create a potential conflict of \ninterest because terrorists could place pressure on his family in an effort to cause \nApplicant to compromise classified information. These relationships create \u201ca heightened \nrisk of foreign inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion\u201d under AG \u00b6 7. \nOverall, the facts show there is a possibility that Applicant could be placed in a \nposition of having to choose between the interests of his foreign family members and the \ninterests of the United States. His ties to the United States are not enough to fully mitigate \nthe risk of undue foreign influence. AG \u00b6\u00b6 8(a), 8(b), and 8(c) do not apply. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the adjudicative guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered \nthe potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under Guideline \nB and the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) in this whole-person analysis. \nI considered Applicant\u2019s three years of honorable service to the U.S. Army National \nGuard, which is a tribute to his character. He also worked in Iraq as a linguist, and was \nsubject to dangerous conditions in a combat zone on behalf of the DOD. I also had to \nweigh this against the discrepant information he provided about his spouse\u2019s foreign \nfamily members and the frequency of contact during the course of his investigation. The \ninvestigator questioned Applicant as to why he failed to list his wife\u2019s siblings on the SCA \nor during his CI interview in August 2017. Applicant stated that he intentionally failed to \nreport these individuals because he did not want his security clearance investigation to \ntake any longer than necessary. Of some concern was Applicant\u2019s aggressive and \ninappropriate conduct during his June 2018 background interview for a DOD security \nclearance. I am not confident about Applicant\u2019s credibility or that he would disclose \ninformation about a security violation if that disclosure might damage his own \nemployment. \nI have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518 (1988), Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, and the AGs, to the facts and \ncircumstances in the context of the whole person.

Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \nStatement of the Case \nOn September 15, 2021, the Department of Defense issued to Applicant a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under Guideline F, financial \nconsiderations. The action was taken under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of \nDefense (DOD) Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance \nReview Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative \nguidelines (AG) effective on June 8, 2017. \nOn September 27, 2021, Applicant answered the SOR and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge.

After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, testimony, and exhibits \nsubmitted, I make the following findings of fact. \nApplicant is 48 years old. She married in 2001 and has children ages 22, 14 and \n9. She earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2005. She started her current job for a federal \ncontractor in September 2020.

In June 2017, her annual salary was approximately $70,000 to \n$80,000 and it increased incrementally. She now earns $128,000 since starting her new \njob in 2020. Her husband is self-employed and earns about $50,000. (Transcript (Tr.) 15-\n20; GE 1) \nIn February 2007, Applicant and her husband filed Chapter 13 bankruptcy. It was \ndismissed in August 2011. She and her husband filed jointly because they did not want \nto lose their house and car. They took the mandatory credit-counseling course required \nfor filing bankruptcy. She explained that in 2007 her husband\u2019s job was the main source \nof income. She was working at a restaurant in 2007 and stopped in May 2008 because \nher daughter was born in June. She started a new job in August 2008 and worked until \nJanuary 2013. She earned about $21,000 annually. (Tr. 21-24, 39-43) \nThe required monthly bankruptcy payments were withdrawn from her husband\u2019s \npay. They were to pay $84 a month for four months and then $450 a month for 56 months. \nThe case was pending for 57 months and the number of months from filing to her last \npayment was 52 months. She testified that they missed eight payments. They were \nnotified in January 2011 that they were on probation for six months beginning in February \n2011 to make all of their payments or the bankruptcy would be dismissed. She did not \ncheck her husband\u2019s pay stub to ensure the payments were being made. The bankruptcy \nwas dismissed in August 2011 for failure to make all of the required payments. She stated \nthat she was unaware at the time that the bankruptcy was dismissed. Their home was \neventually foreclosed. (Tr. 21-24, 35, 41-50; GE 6) \nIn November 2011, Applicant filed Chapter 13 bankruptcy separately. She was \nseparated from her husband at the time and was taking care of her own finances.

She said she wanted \nto file bankruptcy again because she wanted to clear up all of the financial issues that \nremained from the 2007 bankruptcy. She admitted she was having difficulty paying her \nbills because she was trying to take care of her children on a limited income. She took \nthe mandatory credit counseling again required to file bankruptcy. Her monthly payments \nwere $90 for 60 months. (Tr. 22-24, 50-52) \nApplicant\u2019s car stopped working and her lawyer told her to surrender it to the \nlienholder. She did not understand that she was still required to make the bankruptcy \npayments. She said the car was the only remaining secured debt on the bankruptcy. She \nsaid the amount remaining that she owed for the car was $2,200. She had $65,000 of \nunsecured debts. She believed that by surrendering the car it resolved that debt and the \nbankruptcy was completed. She did not think she had to make any other bankruptcy \npayments. She said she confirmed this with her lawyer. She then got a letter from her \nlawyer telling her that her bankruptcy was dismissed, and she could not make up the \nmissed payments. She had made 53 payments. She did not find out until 2017 that the \nbankruptcy was dismissed in June 2016 and her debts were not discharged. Applicant \ntestified that her lawyer explained the difference between a discharge and dismissal in \nbankruptcy. She said she then realized that she needed her debts to be discharged to \nmove on and start over. (Tr. 22-25, 44, 53-73) \nApplicant said from June 2016 to May 2017, she paid her monthly bills and tried \nnot to accumulate new debts. She tried to pay some small bills, but could not afford to \npay any of the larger ones. She was living separately from her husband and was receiving \nminimal support for the children. In June 2017, she started a new job and earned between \n$70,000 and $80,000 annually. (Tr. 52-53, 77-80) \nApplicant filed Chapter 13 bankruptcy again in May 2017. She had the same \nattorney for the three times she filed bankruptcy. She explained that she decided to file \nbankruptcy again because she wanted to have a free and clear discharge of her debts. \nShe wanted a record to show she was trying to complete her bankruptcy and have her \ndebts discharged. She listed her assets as $20,856 and her liabilities as $106,959. She \nexplained the bulk of her liabilities were student loans (approximately $83,000 is student \nloans). She testified that her bankruptcy payments were sent to her attorney, and she \nwas making timely payments and owed one final payment of $128. She had moved \nresidences and her lawyer did not have her new address and did not contact her about \nthe last payment. She missed the last payment, and it was too late to have her debts \ndischarged. She did not want to file a Chapter 7 bankruptcy. The Chapter 13 bankruptcy \nwas dismissed in March 2020. Based on Applicant\u2019s testimony it is obvious she was \nconfused about the bankruptcy process as many of the debts she wanted to clear up \nthrough bankruptcy were likely barred by the statute of limitations when she filed in May \n2017. She believed she was doing the right thing by filing bankruptcy. (Tr. 22-25, 68-75, \n80-83) \nThe SOR alleged four delinquent debts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d - $10,738; 1.e - $965; 1.f - \n$617; and 1.g - $403).

She thought it was a student loan that she had paid. She \nsaid she had a payment agreement with the collection company to settle the debt. She \ncompleted the settlement and resolved the debt in January 2022. She provided \ndocumentation to show it is resolved. (Tr. 25-26, 85-99; GE 8; AE F) \nApplicant made payment arrangements in October 2021 to settle the delinquent \ndebt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.e. She affirmed that her contact with the creditor was after the \nSOR was issued and it prompted her to take action. This debt was for equipment that she \nhad not been returned to her cable company. She paid the settlement and resolved the \ndebt in October 2021. She provided a document showing the debt is resolved. (Tr. 27-28, \n99-102; AE G) \nApplicant explained that the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.f was for a payday loan from about \n2017. She was unable to pay it at the time because she did not have the money. After \nreceipt of the SOR, she made a payment arrangement with the creditor. The debt had \nbeen transferred to a new collection company. She provided a document to show the debt \nwas resolved. (Tr. 28-30, 103-107; AE D) \nApplicant made payment arrangements to settle the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.g. She made \nthe required payments and settled the debt in December 2021. She provided a document \nto show the debt is resolved. (Tr. 31, 33-34, 107-109; AE H) \nApplicant currently has $83,087 of student loans that are deferred under the \ncurrent government program. She has made an arrangement with the student loan \ncreditor to begin making monthly payments in November 2022 to resolve the debt. She \nhas two credit cards with minimal balances that are current. She spoke with a financial \ncounselor on how to manage her finances. Applicant said she never learned how to \nmanage her finances, and she is trying to be fiscally responsible. Her husband handled \nthe finances until she took responsibility for her own in 2011. She pays the bulk of the \nhousehold bills. She was trying to be responsible when she chose to file Chapter 13 \nbankruptcy. She was trying to take care of her children and pay her bills. She is the \nprimary person responsible for paying the bills. She is current with paying her bills. She \ndoes not ask about her husband\u2019s finances. She does not rely on her husband for financial \nsupport, even though they live together. She makes sure that she and her daughter are \ntaken care of. She takes full responsibility for her financial issues. Applicant and her \nhusband took a trip to Jamaica in 2021. (Tr. 32, 85-95, 109-128) \nThe debts listed in her bankruptcy filings include a significant number of medical \ndebts, utilities, and rent. There are also loans and other consumer debts. Her most recent \ncredit report does not report the debts from her bankruptcy or new debts other than what \nwas alleged in the SOR.

Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set out \nin AG \u00b6 18: \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThe Appeal Board explained the scope and rationale for the financial \nconsiderations security concern in ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) \n(citation omitted) as follows: \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might\nknowingly compromise classified information in order to raise money in \nsatisfaction of his or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the \ntotality of an applicant\u2019s financial history and circumstances. The Judge \nmust consider pertinent evidence regarding the applicant\u2019s self-control,\njudgment, and other qualities essential to protecting the national secrets as \nwell as the vulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive \npresumes a nexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines\nand an applicant\u2019s security eligibility.  \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 19 provides conditions that could raise security concerns. The following are \npotentially applicable: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant filed Chapter 13 bankruptcy three times from 2007 to 2017 and each was \ndismissed. She also had four debts alleged in the SOR that became delinquent and were \nunpaid. There is sufficient evidence to support the application of the above disqualifying \nconditions. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable: \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant was underemployed and unemployed at different times from 2007 \nthrough 2017 and was unable to meet her financial obligations. She and her husband \nfiled Chapter 13 bankruptcy in 2007 and made the payments before it was dismissed in \nAugust 2011 when they missed some payments. She filed Chapter 13 bankruptcy \nseparately from her husband in November 2011 and made most of the payments. She \nwas confused when she returned her car to the lienholder believing this satisfied the terms \nof the bankruptcy. Applicant was also confused about the difference between dismissal \nand discharge in bankruptcy. When she learned her debts were not discharged, she filed \nChapter 13 again in 2017 so that the debts could be discharged. The payments went to \nher attorney and she missed the last payment when she moved and was not notified by \nher attorney. The unsecured debts that were included in her bankruptcies are no longer \non her current credit reports. After receiving the SOR, she resolved the four debts alleged \nin the SOR. \nAG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply because Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties were recent \nand not infrequent. She was unemployed and underemployed for periods of time, which \nresulted in her inability to meet her financial obligations, and was beyond her control. She \ndid not ignore her financial responsibility, but rather filed Chapter 13 bankruptcy and made \npayments. I believe Applicant\u2019s unfamiliarity, misunderstanding, and confusion about the \nbankruptcy process caused her additional problems. She and her husband keep their \nfinances separate and she is responsible for paying the bulk of their expenses. She has \nmade Chapter 13 payments for 136 months, repeatedly trying to have her debts \ndischarged so she can start with a clean financial slate. I am not convinced that she \nreceived the best legal advice to repeatedly file Chapter 13 and explanations as to her \npayment obligations. It was obvious that Applicant did not understand the different \nprocesses of the bankruptcy proceedings. I believe she was trying to act responsibly, \ndespite the bankruptcy dismissals.

She does not have \nany current delinquent debts. Her financial problems are under control. AG \u00b6 20(c) \napplies. Applicant paid the four delinquent debts alleged, albeit after she received the \nSOR. AG \u00b6 20(d) applies. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \nApplicant is presently employed in a well-paying job. Her bills are being paid timely. \nAlthough she was never taught how to manage her finances, she is trying to learn. She \nmade bankruptcy payments for years in the hope that her actions were going to resolve \nher past financial issues and her debts would be discharged. She did not ignore her \nresponsibilities, and I believe she was trying to do the right thing. She understands that \nshe must be diligent in ensuring she continues to pay all of her bills timely, not accumulate \nnew delinquent debts, and make student loan payments in accordance with her payment \narrangements, or her security clearance could be in jeopardy. In my whole-person \nassessment, I have considered all of her past financial issues, the fact that many of the \ndebts that were included in her bankruptcy were not paid and are likely barred by the \nstatute of limitations. I believe that now that she has a financial clean slate and significant \nincome, she will be diligent in acting fiscally responsible. Applicant\u2019s finances are not \nperfect and she is taking responsibility for paying the household bills on her own without \nrelying on significant financial contributions from her husband.

He is divorced, having been married from 1998 until 2003. He has two children. Applicant has a 90% Veterans Affairs (VA) disability rating as a result of his service in the U.S. military. Applicant applied for and successfully obtained a security clearance during his time in the military. (Items 4, 5, 6) The SOR alleges Applicant owes 15 delinquent debts totaling about $36,000 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.o).

Applicant \nprovided no documentation substantiating the basis of his dispute or his efforts to \nresolve this debt. The debt is not listed on a credit report after the September 2019 \nreport. (Items 1, 3, 5-7) \nThe $5,725 judgment alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.o has not been resolved. In his \nresponse to the SOR, Applicant claimed that he does not know anything about this \njudgment. He stated that he disputed the judgment, although it is unclear to whom or in \nwhat manner he made the dispute. He provided no evidence of his efforts to resolve this \ndispute. (Items 1, 3, 9) \nApplicant stated that he intends to pay some of the debts in the SOR. He did not \nrespond to the FORM, so more recent information about his finances is not available. \nApplicant submitted a Questionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86) in \nAugust 2019.

(Items 1, 3-5) \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F (Financial Considerations) \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant has a history of financial problems, including an unpaid auto loan, an \nunpaid personal loan, and unpaid telecommunications debt. The evidence is sufficient \nto raise the above disqualifying conditions. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred\nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast\ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment;  \n \n \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and  \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue.  \nApplicant attributed his financial problems to an unexpected offset of his 2017 \nincome tax refund, resulting in bounced checks. He also acknowledged making \nunspecified \u201cmistakes\u201d with respect to his finances. He was unemployed at times in \n2019 and from part of 2016 through part of 2018. \nApplicant\u2019s unemployment was beyond his control. Applicant\u2019s writing checks on \nfunds that had not yet cleared his account and making financial \u201cmistakes\u201d were not \nbeyond his control. \nThere is no documentary evidence of payments or favorable resolution of the \nSOR debts listed in paragraph 1. Applicant stated that he intends to pay some of the \nSOR debts. However, intentions to pay debts in the future are not a substitute for a \ntrack record of debt repayment or other responsible approaches. See ISCR Case No. \n11-14570 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 23, 2013). \nApplicant stated that he has paid some of the other debts in the SOR, but he \nprovided no documents to corroborate his payments of these debts. It is reasonable to \nexpect Applicant to present documentation about the resolution of specific debts. See, \ne.g., ISCR Case No. 15-03363 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 16, 2016). Applicant also claimed \nthat some of the debts in his SOR are no longer a concern because they do not appear \non his credit reports. However, the fact that a debt no longer appears on a credit report \ndoes not establish any meaningful, independent evidence as to the disposition of the \ndebt. ISCR Case No. 14-03612 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 15, 2015). Without additional, \ncredible evidence, the absence of Applicant\u2019s debts on a later credit report does not \nnecessarily show that Applicant has favorably resolved those debts. \nFor various reasons, Applicant states that he is not responsible for the debts in \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.c, 1.d, 1.h, 1.i, 1.k, 1.l, 1.m, 1.n, and 1.o. He disputes that he owes these \ndebts. However, for each of these debts, he either fails to provide documented proof to \nsubstantiate the basis of his dispute, or he fails to provide evidence of his efforts to \nresolve the issue. (AG \u00b6 20(e)) \nThere is insufficient evidence for a determination that Applicant\u2019s financial \nproblems will be resolved within a reasonable period. I am unable to find that he acted \nresponsibly under the circumstances or that he made a good-faith effort to pay his \ndebts. His financial issues are ongoing. They continue to cast doubt on his current \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nreliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. Financial considerations security \nconcerns are not mitigated. \nGuideline E (Personal Conduct) \nThe security concern for personal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 15: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes.  \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying condition is potentially applicable: \n (a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any \npersonnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form \nused to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award \nbenefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or \naward fiduciary responsibilities. \nApplicant failed to disclose any of his delinquent debts on his SF 86. During his \nsubject interview, when an investigator confronted him with his delinquent debts, his\nability to discuss some of these delinquent debts shows that he was aware of them.\nApplicant applied for and obtained a security clearance prior to this investigation,\nindicating that he was familiar with the clearance process. These considerations as well\nas Applicant\u2019s failure to divulge these debts during his subject interview until the\ninvestigator confronted him are sufficient to raise the above disqualifying condition. \n \n \n \n \n \nConditions that could mitigate the personal conduct security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 17. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; and \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is so \ninfrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is unlikely to \nrecur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment. \nApplicant did not correct his omission of divulging his delinquent debts until after \nthe investigator confronted him during his subject interview. There is insufficient \ncorroborating evidence that Applicant\u2019s misleading behavior is infrequent or an outlier. \nHis omission leaves me with questions about his reliability and good judgment. Personal \nconduct security concerns are not mitigated. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F and Guideline E in my whole-person analysis. I also considered Applicant\u2019s \nhonorable military service. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant did not \nmitigate the financial considerations and personal conduct security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.o: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.a: \nAgainst Applicant \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \na security clearance.

Applicant \nresponded to the SOR on July 8, 2021, and requested a hearing before an \nadministrative judge. The case was assigned to me on June 9, 2022. \nThe hearing was convened as scheduled on June 27, 2022. Government \nExhibits (GE) 1 through 8 were admitted in evidence without objection. Applicant \ntestified and submitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AE) A through H, which were admitted \nwithout objection. The record was held open for Applicant to submit additional \ninformation.

He married in \n2014 and divorced in 2017. He and his ex-wife have a child together, and he has a child \nwith his fianc\u00e9e. (Transcript (Tr.) at 9, 20-21, 26-28, 63; GE 1; AE H) \nApplicant was arrested in 2015 and charged with driving while intoxicated (DWI) \nand felony grand larceny-auto theft. He pleaded guilty to DWI and the lesser \nmisdemeanor charge of unauthorized use of a vehicle. He was sentenced to 12 months \nin jail, with 11 months suspended for the unauthorized use of a vehicle charge. For the \nDWI charge, he was sentenced to 60 days in jail, with 55 days suspended; probation for \n12 months; a fine; and court costs. His driver\u2019s license was restricted, and he was \nrequired to attend alcohol education classes. (Tr. at 25-26; Applicant\u2019s response to \nSOR; GE 1, 3, 4) \nApplicant admitted that he was drunk when he was arrested. He stated that he \ndrove a short distance from a bar to a 7-11 that was next to an IHOP. He left his car \nrunning at the 7-11 with an open alcoholic beverage inside that was left by his cousin. \nHe was arrested as he was coming out of the IHOP. He fit the race and general \ndescription of someone who took a mall officer\u2019s vehicle at the mall close to where the \nbar was located. Applicant does not think that he took the mall officer\u2019s car because \nApplicant\u2019s car was at the 7-11 next to the IHOP running, so he does not understand \nhow he could have driven both cars, but he blacked out and does not remember, so he \ncannot completely rule it out. He accepted a plea bargain on the case because he did \nnot want to risk the greater consequences, and he knew that he was very drunk and \nshould not have been driving. (Tr. at 45-48; GE 1, 3) \nApplicant was arrested in June 2018 and charged with DWI, second offense. He \nwas stopped after making an illegal left turn. He had two to three beers, but he did not \nfeel that he was intoxicated. He stated the police officer had difficulty with the \nbreathalyzer. He retained an attorney and was going to contest the case, but decided to \nplead guilty with a plea bargain. He was sentenced to 90 days in jail, with 80 days \nsuspended; a fine; and his driver\u2019s license was suspended for an extended period. He \ncompleted all of the terms of his sentence, except his license is still suspended. The \nsuspension will end in February 2023, but he will require an Interlock ignition device for \nan additional two years. (Tr. at 21-22, 50-57, 61; GE 1, 3, 4) \nApplicant has not been involved in any criminal activity since his 2018 arrest. He \ndrank on rare occasions for about two years following the arrest, and he has been \ncompletely abstinent for about two years. His fianc\u00e9e does not drink, and he has a \nhealth condition that precludes the use of alcohol. He regularly attends church, and he \nis committed to a healthy lifestyle that includes physical fitness.

He had some problems with his tax preparer, and the returns got \naway from him. The returns were filed in April 2020. The returns indicate that he was \ndue refunds of $709 from the IRS and $73 from the state. There are no other income \ntax issues. (Tr. at 29-32; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1, 3; AE L) \nThe SOR alleges the untimely 2018 tax returns, a charged-off auto loan for \n$12,556 after the vehicle was repossessed, and 21 defaulted student loans totaling \nabout $100,671. The debts are established through credit reports and Applicant\u2019s \nadmissions. \nApplicant attributed his financial problems to his divorce and custody \nproceedings; child support; a government shutdown; the pandemic; and the court fees, \nfines, and attorney\u2019s fees associated with his two DWIs. (Tr. at 18, 24, 61) \nIn December 2020, Applicant started paying $100 per month to the credit union \nfor the $12,556 charged-off auto loan. The creditor charged off $13,661, but the balance \nwas reduced by payments. He made nine payments through August 2021. The balance \nwas reduced to $11,856 by the August 2021 credit report; $11,556 by the June 2022 \ncredit report; and $11,195 by the date of the hearing. He recently settled the debt for \n$8,000, payable in at least 21 monthly payments of $361. (Tr. at 20, 39-40; GE 5-8; AE \nG) \nApplicant\u2019s federal student loans are paused because of COVID relief, and he \nrestarted college this fall. However, Applicant decided the best course of action was not \nto stand on the deferments, but to aggressively pay down the loans. He lives at his \nparents\u2019 house with his fianc\u00e9e and their child. He does not own a car. His fianc\u00e9e \nworks and contributes to their income. He has been paying $1,172 per month toward all \nof the loans since April 1, 2022, but he plans to increase the payments. He intends to \nlive at his parent\u2019s home for two to three years. (Tr. at 18-20, 26-28, 33-39, 61-63; GE 3; \nAE F, H-K) \nApplicant reported his two alcohol-related arrests, his failure to file his 2018 tax \nreturns, the delinquent auto loan, and the defaulted student loans on his January 2020 \nQuestionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86). He completed a number of IT and \ncyber certifications that make him more valuable to an employer, and he is four credits \nshort of completing his graduate degree in the cyber field. His mother is a retired military \nofficer and provides him guidance and moral support. (Tr. at 23-28, 61; GE 1; AE A-E) I \nfound him to be open, honest, and candid about all of the issues. \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \n4 \n\n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption \nThe security concern for alcohol consumption is set out in AG \u00b6 21: \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about \nan individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 22. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under \nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or \nother incidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the individual's \nalcohol use or whether the individual has been diagnosed with alcohol use \ndisorder; and \n(c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired \njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed with alcohol \nuse disorder. \nApplicant was arrested for DWI in 2015 and 2018. The above disqualifying \nconditions are applicable. \nConditions that could mitigate alcohol consumption security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 23. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, \nor judgment; and \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive alcohol \nuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas demonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified \nconsumption \nor \nabstinence \nin \naccordance \nwith \ntreatment \nrecommendations. \nApplicant has not had an alcohol-related offense in more than four years. He \ndrank on rare occasions for about two years following the arrest, and he has been \ncompletely abstinent for about two years. His fianc\u00e9e does not drink, and he has a \nhealth condition that precludes the use of alcohol. He regularly attends church, and he \nis committed to a healthy lifestyle that includes physical fitness. Applicant established a \npattern of abstinence, and alcohol consumption no longer casts doubt on his reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and good judgment. AG \u00b6\u00b6 23(a) and 23(b) are applicable. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct \nThe security concern for criminal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 30: \nCriminal activity creates doubt about an Applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, \nand trustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s \nability or willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations. \nAG \u00b6 31 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following is potentially applicable: \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted. \nApplicant\u2019s alcohol-related arrests were cross-alleged under criminal conduct. \nThe above disqualifying condition is applicable. \nConditions that could mitigate criminal conduct security concerns are provided \nunder AG \u00b6 32. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment; and \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited \nto, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \nApplicant has been abstinent for about two years, and there has been no criminal \nactivity in more than four years. His fianc\u00e9e does not drink, and he has a health \ncondition that precludes the use of alcohol. He regularly attends church, and he is \ncommitted to a healthy lifestyle that includes physical fitness. He completed a number of \nIT and cyber certifications that make him more valuable to an employer, and he is four \ncredits short of completing his graduate degree in the cyber field. His mother is a retired \nmilitary officer and provides him guidance and moral support. I found him to be open, \nhonest, and candid about all of the issues. Applicant is still a young man at 30 years old, \nbut I believe he has matured and this kind of conduct is in the past. \nThe discussion above under alcohol consumption applies equally here. I find \nevidence of successful rehabilitation; the conduct is unlikely to recur; and it no longer \ncasts doubt on Applicant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. AG \u00b6\u00b6 32(a) \nand 32(d) are applicable. \n6 \n\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \nApplicant has a history of financial problems, including defaulted student loans \nand a repossessed vehicle. He did not file his federal and state income tax returns for \n2018 when they were due. The above disqualifying conditions are applicable. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nApplicant attributed his financial problems to his divorce and custody \nproceedings; child support; a government shutdown; the pandemic; and the court fees, \nfines, and attorney\u2019s fees associated with his two DWIs. Any financial issues resulting \nfrom the DWIs were not beyond his control. AG \u00b6 20(b) has minimal applicability. \nThe 2018 federal and state income tax returns were filed in April 2020, after he \nsubmitted his SF 86, but well before the SOR was issued. The returns indicate that he \nwas due refunds of $709 from the IRS and $73 from the state. There are no other \nincome tax issues. Applicant\u2019s failure to file his tax returns when required raises \nquestions about his judgment and willingness to abide by rules and regulations. \nNonetheless, I am satisfied that he has learned a valuable lesson, and that all future \nreturns will be filed on time. AG \u00b6 20(g) is applicable. \nApplicant has been paying the charged-off auto loan since December 2020, \nreducing the balance by about $2,466 from $13,661 to $11,195. His student loans are in \ndeferment. He decided the best course of action was not to stand on the deferments, \nbut to aggressively pay down the loans. He lives at his parents\u2019 house with his fianc\u00e9e \nand their child. He does not own a car. His fianc\u00e9e works and contributes to their \nincome. He has been paying $1,172 per month toward all of the loans since April 1, \n2022, but he plans to increase the payments. He intends to live at his parent\u2019s home for \ntwo to three years. \nApplicant has a plan to resolve his financial problems, and he took significant \naction to implement that plan. He acted responsibly under the circumstances and made \na good-faith effort to pay his debts. His finances do not cast doubt on his current \njudgment, reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information. \nSecurity concerns about Applicant\u2019s finances are mitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \n8 \n\n________________________ \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guidelines F, G, and J in my whole-person analysis. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant \nmitigated the financial considerations, alcohol consumption, and criminal conduct \nsecurity concerns.1 \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.x: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline G: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.b: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 3, Guideline J: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 3.a: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \nEdward W. Loughran \nAdministrative Judge \n1 The adjudicative guidelines give me the authority to grant conditional eligibility \u201cdespite the presence of \nissue information that can be partially but not completely mitigated, with the provision that additional \nsecurity measures shall be required to mitigate the issue(s).\u201d I have not done so as I have concluded the \nissues are completely mitigated, and it is unnecessary to further monitor Applicant. \n9 \n",

After a thorough and \ncareful review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following additional \nfindings of fact. \nApplicant is 57 years old. She recently married in March 2022, for the second \ntime. She has three adult children from her first marriage. He has worked for her current \ndefense contractor-employer since 2011. She is a high school graduate.

(SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.c) \nHer DWI arrests were also alleged as criminal conduct under Guideline J in the SOR. \n(SOR \u00b6 2.a) \nApplicant completed her 2018 security clearance in January 2018. Her February \n2018 DWI charge occurred after she spent the evening at a girlfriend\u2019s house and \nconsumed \u201cquite a few\u201d glasses of wine.

(Tr. 27-28, 30-36; GE 3, 5) \nApplicant\u2019s February 2014 DWI charge occurred after she spent the evening at a \nfriend\u2019s house and claimed she drank two beers before driving home. She was stopped \nby law enforcement for having a non-operable license-plate light. She performed field \nsobriety tests but refused breath and blood testing. She was charged with DWI. The \nfinal disposition was a reduction of the charge to obstruction of a highway. Her sentence \nincluded 14 months of community service and a fine. (Tr. 43-45; GE 3-4) \nApplicant\u2019s July 2004 DWI charge occurred when she decided to drive from her \nhome to get some food after she had been drinking alcohol. It was raining during her \ndrive and she lost control of her car when rounding a corner. She was alone in the car. \nApplicant does not recall the details of what happened next after the accident. She was \nhospitalized and treated. Later, she became aware that she was charged with DWI. The \ncharge was ultimately dismissed, but the record does not explain why. In her security \nclearance applications, she indicated she sought alcohol treatment or counseling for \none month in 2004. She provided no further details about this counseling. (GE 1-4) \nApplicant testified that she continues to drink alcohol to include drinking to \nintoxication four to six times a month. She claimed she last drank to intoxication in \nDecember 2021. She also claimed that she no longer drives after drinking alcohol and \nshe has not done so since her 2018 arrest. She believes that she is an alcoholic, but \nshe also believes she does not have a current alcohol problem. She last attended AA \nover a year ago. She has not attended any other alcohol treatment or counseling \nprogram since her court-ordered counseling after her 2018 arrest. She realizes she \nmade mistakes and she is sorry for them. (Tr. 37-41, 47) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n2(a), the entire process is a careful weighing of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption \nAG \u00b6 21 expresses the security concern pertaining to alcohol consumption: \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about \nan individual's reliability and trustworthiness. \nAG \u00b6 22 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under \nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or \nother incidents of concern, regardless of whether the individual is \ndiagnosed with alcohol use disorder; and \n(c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired \njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed with alcohol \nuse disorder. \nApplicant\u2019s three DWIs in 14 years support the application of the above \ndisqualifying conditions. \nI have also considered all of the mitigating conditions for alcohol consumption \nunder AG \u00b6 23 and found the following relevant: \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, \nor judgment; \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive alcohol \nuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of modified consumption or abstinence in \naccordance with treatment recommendations; and \n(d) the individual has successfully completed a treatment program along \nwith any required aftercare, and has demonstrated a clear and established \npattern of modified consumption or abstinence in accordance with \ntreatment recommendations. \nApplicant\u2019s last adverse alcohol incident occurred in February 2018. While a \nconsiderable amount of time has passed, her continued pattern of abusing alcohol \nminimizes that passage of time. Her alcohol-related incidents have not been infrequent, \nsince she has been charged three times since 2004. She was arrested for her third DWI \nshortly after completing her January 2018 SCA. She continues to drink alcohol, even to \nthe point of intoxication, several times a month. She has not availed herself of any \ncounseling or treatment beyond a vague reference to a one-month attendance in 2004 \n(without any details) and her court-ordered counseling from her 2018 DWI conviction. \nThe record evidence does not support a finding that Applicant has modified her \nconsumption of alcohol in a significant way. Based upon her long pattern of alcohol \nabuse and continued use of alcohol, I cannot conclude that an alcohol-related incident \nwill not recur in the future. Her actions cast doubt on his current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and good judgment. None of the above mitigating conditions apply. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for criminal conduct is set out in AG \n\u00b6 30: \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability \nor willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations. \nAG \u00b6 31 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) a pattern of minor offenses, any one of which on its own would be \nunlikely to affect a national security eligibility decision, but which in \ncombination cast doubt on the individual\u2019s judgment, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness; and \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the person was formally charged, formally prosecuted or \nconvicted. \nApplicant\u2019s three DWIs constitute a pattern of criminal conduct. I find that both \ndisqualifying conditions apply. \nI have also considered all of the mitigating conditions for criminal conduct under \nAG \u00b6 32 and considered the following relevant: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment; and \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited \nto the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \nApplicant\u2019s last criminal incident occurred in March 2018. Her criminal acts have \nnot been infrequent having been arrested on DWI charges three times since 2004. She \ncontinues to drink alcohol to the point of intoxication several times a month. I cannot \nconclude that additional crimes are not likely to recur in the future. Her repeated criminal \nbehavior and apparent unwillingness to change her drinking patterns cast doubt on her \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment, and it also shows a lack of \nsuccessful rehabilitation. AG \u00b6\u00b6 32(a) and 32(d) do not apply. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I considered Applicant\u2019s contractor \nservice, her expression of remorse, and her family circumstances at the time of her \n2018 arrest. However, I also considered that she has not reformed her alcohol misuse \nleading to criminal DWI charges. Applicant failed to provide sufficient evidence to \nmitigate the alcohol consumption and criminal conduct security concerns. \nOverall the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns under Guidelines G and J. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline G: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.c: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.d: \nWithdrawn \nParagraph 2, Guideline J: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a: \nAgainst Applicant \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

His admissions are adopted as findings of fact. After a careful review of \nthe pleadings and evidence, I make the following additional findings of fact. \nApplicant is 37 years old. He has worked for a defense contractor since February \n2020, as a materials handler. From 2017 to 2020, he worked non-government private \nsector jobs. He was unemployed from May 2016 to March 2017 and from March 2013 to \nSeptember 2014. He is a high school graduate and has taken some college courses. He \nhas never married but has cohabitated since May 2019. He has no children. He is \nseeking his first security clearance. (Items 3-4). \nThe SOR alleged Applicant owed four delinquent accounts totaling approximately \n$14,996. (\u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.d) Applicant admitted owing these debts in his May 2020 security \nclearance application (SCA) and in his August 2020 personal subject interview (PSI) by \na defense investigator. An August 2020 credit report also lists all four debts as \ndelinquent. In his answer to the SOR, he admitted owing two of the debts and denied \nowing the other two without giving a further explanation. The SOR also alleged \nApplicant failed to file his 2013 through 2019 federal and state income tax returns, as \nrequired (\u00b6\u00b6 1.e-1.f). Applicant admitted, during his PSI, failing to file his federal and \nstate income tax returns for years 2013, 2017, 2018, and 2019. He further explained he \ndid not file federal or state income tax returns for years 2014-2016 because he had \ninsufficient income to require him to file. (Items 3-5) \nApplicant claims his delinquent debts were caused by his unemployment in 2013 \nthat resulted in financial hardship. He did not reach out to his creditors at the time to \nresolve the debts because he was financially unable to do so. During his PSI, he stated \nthat he intended to settle these debts because he now had a steady job. He failed to \nproduce documentary evidence showing that he has made any payments toward these \ndebts, or established a payment or settlement plan with the creditors. His four \ndelinquent debts are unresolved.

(Items 1-6) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nAG \u00b6 18 expresses the security concern for financial considerations: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. I have \nconsidered all of them under AG \u00b6 19 and the following potentially apply: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \nApplicant has delinquent consumer debts that remain unpaid or unresolved. He \nalso has failed to file his 2013-2019 federal and state income tax returns, or document \nthat he was not required to file those returns. I find all the above disqualifying conditions \nare raised. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns \narising from financial difficulties. I have considered all of the mitigating conditions under \nAG \u00b6 20 and the following potentially apply: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nApplicant\u2019s debts are recent and remain unresolved. He did not provide sufficient \nevidence to show that his financial problems are unlikely to recur. AG \u00b6 20(a) does not \napply. His overall financial problems started in 2013 when he lost his job. This was a \ncircumstance beyond his control. However, the evidence does not support that he has \ntaken responsible actions to address his debts or timely file his federal and state tax \nreturns. He failed to document any efforts he made to resolve or pay his delinquent \ndebts. Likewise, he claims that he filed all the federal and state tax returns he was \nrequired to file, yet he failed to document these filings or establish that he was not \nrequired to file returns for years 2014-2016. AG \u00b6 20(b) does fully apply. There is no \nevidence of financial counseling. There is no documentary evidence showing he made \narrangements with the IRS to resolve his tax issues. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(c) and 20(d), and 20(g) \ndo not apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n        \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guideline and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I considered his periods of \nunemployment, but I also considered his lack of progress in resolving his debts and his \nfailure to prove he filed his 2013-2019 federal and state income tax returns. Applicant \nhas not established a track record of financial responsibility. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns arising under Guideline F, \nfinancial considerations. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1f: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant  \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

He was promoted to a management position in \nFebruary 2022. He previously applied for and was granted public trust eligibility in 2018 \nto support a specific federal contract.

He does not require a security \nclearance for his current position, but obtaining eligibility allows his employer more \nflexibility in staffing him on other contracts. On his security clearance application, \nApplicant disclosed marijuana use between October 2007 and January 2020 several \ntimes a week to help with his anxiety and depression. He also indicated that he intended \nto continue using the drug in the future. (GE 1-2, Tr. 12-15, 18) \nApplicant began using marijuana recreationally in college. He continued to use \nmarijuana after he graduated from college in February 2011. His frequency of use \nvaried based on the availability of the drug in social settings. He explained that he also \nengaged in periods of abstinence from marijuana, but would resume use. When he \napplied for public trust eligibility in 2018, he had not used marijuana in the preceding \nyear. However, he resumed use after the contract he was supporting ended and he \nbelieved he no longer maintained public trust eligibility. (Tr. 16, 18-9, 25-26, 31) \nAt the time he completed his security clearance application in January 2020, \nApplicant disclosed that he continued to use marijuana on a regular basis. In a February \n2020 subject interview with a background investigator, Applicant stated that he \ncontinued to use marijuana on a daily basis with friends and to self-medicate anxiety \nand depressed moods. He denied seeking help for the underlying mental-health issues, \nand reiterated his intent to use marijuana in the future. Over a year later, in April 2021, \nApplicant answered a set of interrogatories from DOD regarding his drug use. He \nreported that he continued to use marijuana several times each week with intent to \ncontinue use the future. Applicant admitted that he purchased the drug on occasion, but \nhad not done so since at least 2018 or 2019. He reported using the drug when it was \nprovided by friends. He disclosed that he still associated with friends who used the drug \non a regular basis. He also admitted that he had not made any changes to his life to \nsupport abstinence to include substance abuse counseling or seeking treatment for his \nanxiety and depression. (GE 1, GE 3; Tr. 20, 26) \nApplicant used marijuana daily until he received the SOR in April 2021, when he \nstopped.

One witness, a close friend, testified that he was aware of Applicant\u2019s marijuana \nuse, but had not seen him use the drug in social settings over the past year. He also \nstated that Applicant expressed his desire to stop smoking marijuana. Applicant testified \nthat marijuana use is no longer compatible with his lifestyle and that the demands of his \ncareer are paramount. He reinforced his intention to abstain from drug use in the future. \nHowever, Applicant\u2019s two roommates, one of whom is his girlfriend, continue to use \nmarijuana. His girlfriend, who has a medicinal marijuana card, uses the drug regularly. \nApplicant testified that he has asked her not to use the drug in the same room as him. \nHis social circle still consists of regular marijuana users. He stated that he does not use \nthe drug when his friends use it in his presence. (Answer; Tr. 29. 37-43, 47-52) \nAt the hearing, Applicant admitted that he had not made any specific changes to \nhis lifestyle to support abstinence. He testified that at an unspecified time before 2019, \nhe attended therapy to work through some personal issues. Although he touched on his \nanxiety and depression issues, they were not the focus of the sessions. He continued to \nuse marijuana while he was in therapy. He did not make any connections between his \nhistory of marijuana use and his feelings. He concluded that he was not using the drug \nto self-medicate but because he enjoyed the effects of it. (Tr. 31-37) \nApplicant explained that he understood that even though recreational marijuana \nuse has been decriminalized in his state of residence, that marijuana use remains illegal \nthere and that it is illegal under federal law. (GE 3, 21) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nThe SOR alleges disqualifying conduct under the drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse guideline. The government has established a prima facie case. \nDrug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe illegal use of controlled substances . . . that cause physical or mental \nimpairment . . . raises questions about an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, \nboth because such behavior may lead to physical or psychological impairment and \nbecause it raises questions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, \nrules, and regulations. (See AG \u00b6 24). \nApplicant admits to a history of marijuana use that began in 2007 and continued \nuntil he received the SOR in April 2021. On three occasions during the adjudication of \nhis national security eligibility, Applicant expressed his intent to use marijuana in the \nfuture. The following disqualifying conditions apply. \nAG \u00b6 25(a) any substance misuse; \nAG \u00b6 25(g) expressed intent to continue drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, or failure to clearance and convincingly commit to discontinue \nsuch use. \nNone of the relevant mitigating conditions apply. Applicant has a 14-year history \nof marijuana use. Given his multiple statements of intent to use in the future, his \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \npromise to abstain from use in the future is not credible. His last reported use occurred \nonly 18 months ago, which is not sufficient evidence of habit change especially given \nhis history of use after periods of abstinence. Furthermore, he has not made changes to \nhis lifestyle to support prolonged abstinence. Given the regular marijuana use that \noccurs in his home and social circle as well as his untreated depression and anxiety \nissues, potential for relapse remains high. \nBased on the record, Applicant is not a suitable candidate for access to classified \ninformation at this time. This decision is not changed by a consideration of the facts \nunder the whole-person factors listed in AG \u00b6 2(d). An adverse decision in this case is \nnot a determination that Applicant cannot achieve a sufficient period of abstinence to \nobtain a security clearance in the future. However, at this time, his marijuana use is too \nrecent and his period of abstinence too short to mitigate the concerns raised by his \nhistory of marijuana use. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Drug Involvement and  \nSubstance Misuse: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.b \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented in this case, it is not clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s security clearance.

De Angelis, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n05/06/2022 \nDecision \nHARVEY, Mark, Administrative Judge: \nThe statement of reasons (SOR) alleges and Applicant admitted that he possessed \nand used marijuana and lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) after he was granted an interim \nsecret clearance. Security concerns arising under Guideline H (drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse) are not mitigated. Eligibility for access to classified information is \ndenied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn April 7, 2020, Applicant completed and signed a Questionnaires for National \nSecurity Positions (SF 86) or security clearance application (SCA). (Government Exhibit \n(GE) 1). On November 1, 2021, the Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency, \nConsolidated Adjudications Facility (CAF) issued an SOR to Applicant under Executive \nOrder (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry, February \n20, 1960; Department of Defense (DOD) Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (Directive), January 2, 1992; and Security Executive \nAgent Directive 4, establishing in Appendix A the National Security Adjudicative \nGuidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to \nHold a Sensitive Position (AGs), effective June 8, 2017. (Hearing Exhibit (HE) 2) \nThe SOR detailed reasons why the DOD CAF did not find under the Directive that \nit is clearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant or continue a security \nclearance for Applicant and recommended referral to an administrative judge to \n\n \n2 \n                                         \n \ndetermine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. \nSpecifically, the SOR set forth security concerns arising under Guideline H. (HE 2) On \nNovember 8, 2021, Applicant provided a response to the SOR and requested a hearing. \n(HE 3) On February 16, 2022, Department Counsel was ready to proceed.    \n \nOn February 23, 2022, the case was assigned to me. On March 4, 2022, the \nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing, setting the \nhearing for March 17, 2022. (HE 1) The hearing was held as scheduled.  \n \nDepartment Counsel offered 5 exhibits into evidence; Applicant offered 24 exhibits \ninto evidence; there were no objections; and all proffered exhibits were admitted into \nevidence. (Transcript (Tr.) 17-20; GE 1-GE 5; Applicant Exhibit (AE) 1-24) On March 28, \n2022, DOHA received a transcript of the hearing.  \n \nApplicant diligently, timely, and professionally responded to all inquiries from the \nCAF and others during the security clearance process. (Tr. 26-31; AE 6-AE 10; AE 13-\nAE 17) He endeavored to expedite the security clearance process. (Id.) \n \nSome details were excluded to protect Applicant\u2019s right to privacy. Specific \ninformation is available in the cited exhibits and transcript. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s SOR response, he denied the SOR allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b. \n(HE 3) He also provided mitigating information. He made some partial admissions in his \nSOR response. His admissions are accepted as findings of fact. Additional findings follow.   \n \nApplicant is a 34-year-old industrial engineer who has worked for the same \ndefense contractor since 2013. (Tr. 6-8; GE 1) In 2006, he graduated from high school, \nand in 2012, he received a bachelor\u2019s degree. (Tr. 6) His bachelor\u2019s degree was in \nindustrial and systems engineering. (Tr. 6) The trend in his grades has been towards \nimproved grades.

(Tr. 7) There is no evidence of security \nviolations, employee discipline, arrests, or alcohol abuse. \n \nDrug Involvement and Substance Misuse \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.a alleges Applicant used marijuana with varying frequency from about \n2010 to at least June 2021. His marijuana use continued after he received access to \nclassified information in April 2020. \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.b alleges Applicant used LSD with varying frequency from about 2016 \nuntil at least February 2021. His LSD use continued after he received access to classified \ninformation in April 2020. \n \n\n \n3 \n                                         \n \nApplicant\u2019s first and second marijuana use occurred when he was in college. (Tr. \n41-42) When his employer hired him in 2013, he received a drug screen, which he \npassed. (Tr. 31, 43) As part of in-processing at his employment, he probably received a \nbriefing or written materials about not using illegal drugs. (Tr. 43) He said the company \nrequests that employees not use illegal drugs. (Tr. 44) Over one six-year period, he \nreceived three random drug screens or tests, and he did not test positive on any of them. \n(Tr. 44) During a subsequent period, he used marijuana once or twice a month on \nweekends and during off-duty hours. (Tr. 45)  \n \nApplicant\u2019s employer\u2019s policy specifically prohibits any use of marijuana regardless \nof state laws that authorize its use. (GE 5 at 5) The drug policy also prohibits possession \nof any illegal or controlled substance. (Id.) Applicant denied that he intentionally violated \nhis employer\u2019s policy prohibiting use of illegal drugs. (Tr. 47) He was only vaguely aware \nthat his employer prohibited illegal drug use; however, he was aware that possession of \nmarijuana and LSD violated federal law. (Tr. 48) There is currently marijuana in his \nresidence; however, he said it was his spouse\u2019s marijuana. (Tr. 55)  \n \nApplicant did not disclose his possession and use of any illegal drugs on his April \n7, 2020 SCA. (GE 1) On May 7, 2020, an Office of Personnel Management (OPM) \ninvestigator interviewed Applicant, and he said that from 2010 to May 1, 2020, he used \nmarijuana on average every two or three months. (GE 2) He received the marijuana from \nfriends, acquaintances, and his spouse. (Id.) From 2016 to present, he used LSD four \ntimes with his most recent LSD use occurring in mid-April 2020. (Id.) His spouse provided \nthe LSD to him. (Id.) He explained that his failure to disclose his illegal drug use on his \nSCA occurred because he hurried through the SCA and had difficulty completing it \nbecause of computer problems. (Id.)  \n \nApplicant said the most reliable information about the extent of his marijuana use \nwas during his OPM interview. (Tr. 45; GE 2) His most recent marijuana use was \u201cbefore \nJune of 2021.\u201d (Tr. 45, 55) He could not provide the specific date he most recently used \nmarijuana. (Tr. 60)   \n \nApplicant first used LSD in 2016, and during his lifetime, he used LSD a total five \ntimes. (Tr. 48) His most recent LSD use was on February 13, 2021. (Tr. 48, 51; GE 2 at \n8) On February 13, 2021, he used LSD that his spouse provided to him as a \u201cbonding \nexperience.\u201d He did not use LSD with the intention of violating his employer\u2019s rules or \nfederal law. (Tr. 52, 54)  \n \nApplicant has never purchased marijuana. (Tr. 60) His spouse occasionally \npurchases marijuana. (Tr. 46) His spouse uses marijuana. He associates with her, and \nshe is involved in use of illegal drugs. (Tr. 53) He told his wife not to give him illegal drugs \nin the future. (Tr. 54) He does not intend to use illegal drugs in the future because \npossession of a security clearance and career opportunities are \u201cfar more important\u201d than \nhis desire to continue to use illegal drugs. (Tr. 49) \n \nThe Defense Information System for Security (DISS) indicates Applicant received \nan interim secret clearance on April 14, 2020. (GE 3) In August 2020, Applicant signed a \n\n \n4 \n                                         \n \nnon-disclosure agreement in connection with his access to classified information, and at \nthat time, Applicant learned he had an interim security clearance. (Tr. 56-57; GE 4) \nHowever, he did not actually receive access to any classified information because the \ninformation he needed to access was top secret, and the interim clearance was \ninsufficient for him to have access to top secret information. (Tr. 56-58) Applicant has not \nreceived any drug-related counseling or therapy. (Tr. 55) \n  \nCharacter Evidence \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s character evidence supports approval of his access to classified \ninformation. He received positive performance evaluations, which indicate he is an \noutstanding employee who has made important contributions to the success of his \nemployer. (Tr. 20-25; AE 1-AE 5) He is an intelligent, talented, professional, and diligent \nhigh performer who is an innovative problem solver. His credit report does not contain \nany negative financial information. (Tr. 32; AE 11) His credit score is 761. (Tr. 33; AE 12) \nFrom 2013 to 2017, he paid about $27,000 in student loans. (Tr. 33) He cares for his \nmother, who was injured in a fall in 2021. (Tr. 37; AE 23) The general sense of his letters \nof recommendation is that he is trustworthy, diligent, professional, responsible, reliable, \nand intelligent. (Tr. 34-37; AE 21; AE 22) He has outstanding communication skills, \njudgment, and leadership. (Id.)  \n  \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The President \nhas authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicant\u2019s eligibility for \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended.  \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable.  \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \n\n \n5 \n                                         \n \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Clearance \ndecisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \nThus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that it is based, in whole or \nin part, on any express or implied determination about applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or \npatriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the \nPresident, Secretary of Defense, and Director of National Intelligence have established \nfor issuing a clearance. \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 \n(App. Bd. May 2, 1996). \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of disproving a \nmitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 \n(App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, \non the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nDrug Involvement and Substance Misuse \n \n  \nAG \u00b6 24 provides the security concern arising from drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse stating: \n \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises questions \nabout a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and \nregulations. Controlled substance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d as \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in \nthis guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \n \n\n \n6 \n                                         \n \nAG \u00b6 25 provides conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \u201c(a) any substance misuse (see above definition)\u201d; \u201c(c) illegal \npossession of a controlled substance. . . .\u201d; and \u201c(f) any illegal drug use while granted \naccess to classified information or holding a sensitive position.\u201d The record establishes \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a), 25(c), and 25(f). Additional information is contained in the mitigation section, \ninfra.   \n \nAG \u00b6 26 lists four conditions that could mitigate security concerns: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: \n \n \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n \n \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; and \n \n \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility; \n \n(c) abuse of prescription drugs was after a severe or prolonged illness \nduring which these drugs were prescribed, and abuse has since ended; and \n \n(d) satisfactory completion of a prescribed drug treatment program, \nincluding, but not limited to, rehabilitation and aftercare requirements, \nwithout recurrence of abuse, and a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified \nmedical professional. \n \nIn ISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013), the DOHA Appeal \nBoard concisely explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for proving the applicability of \nmitigating conditions as follows:  \n \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of \na security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government \npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the \napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The \nstandard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in \nEgan, supra. \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access \n\n \n7 \n                                         \n \nto classified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nDirective, Enclosure 2, [App. A] \u00b6 2(b).   \n \nNone of the mitigating conditions fully apply; however, Applicant provided some \nimportant mitigating information. He has an outstanding employment record. He \npresented substantial good character evidence. He promised not to use illegal drugs in \nthe future. He voluntarily disclosed his marijuana and LSD possession and use during the \nsecurity clearance process.      \n \nThe evidence against mitigation is more persuasive at this time. In ISCR Case No. \n16-03460 at 4 (App. Bd. May 24, 2018), the applicant had a history of marijuana use, and \nthe Appeal Board said:  \n \nA clearance adjudication is aimed at determining if an applicant has the \nrequisite judgment and reliability to abide by rules designed to protect \nclassified information. . . . [Security concerns arise if] there is doubt as to \nwhether he [or she] will follow the regulatory requirements for handling \nclassified information, which might, in the event, appear burdensome. \nAccess to national secrets entails a fiduciary duty to the U.S. A person who \nenters into such a fiduciary relationship is charged with abiding by legal and \nregulatory guidance regardless of whether he or she believes that guidance \nto be wise. \n \nPossession of a Schedule I controlled substance is a federal criminal offense. \nSchedules I, II, III, IV, and V, as referred to in the Controlled Substances Act are contained \nin 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 812(c). Marijuana and LSD are Schedule I controlled substances. See Drug \nEnforcement Administration listing at http://www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/21cfr/cfr/1308/ \n1308 11.htm. See also Gonzales v. Raish, 545 U.S. 1 (2005) (discussing placement of \nmarijuana on Schedule I). \n \nThe Director of National Intelligence (DNI) Memorandum ES 2014-00674, \n\u201cAdherence to Federal Laws Prohibiting Marijuana Use,\u201d October 25, 2014, states: \n \n[C]hanges to state laws and the laws of the District of Columbia pertaining \nto marijuana use do not alter the existing National Security Adjudicative \nGuidelines . . . . An individual\u2019s disregard of federal law pertaining to the \nuse, sale, or manufacture of marijuana remains adjudicatively relevant in \nnational security determinations. As always, adjudicative authorities are \nexpected to evaluate claimed or developed use of, or involvement with, \nmarijuana using the current adjudicative criteria. The adjudicative authority \nmust determine if the use of, or involvement with, marijuana raises \nquestions about the individual\u2019s judgment, reliability, trustworthiness, and \nwillingness to comply with law, rules, and regulations, including federal \nlaws, when making eligibility decisions of persons proposed for, or \noccupying, sensitive national security positions. \n  \n\n \n8 \n                                         \n \nSee ISCR Case No. ISCR Case No. 20-01772 (App. Bd. Sept. 14, 2021) (noting \ncontinued relevance of October 15, 2014 DNI Memorandum in the application of \nGuideline H for marijuana cases).  \n \nApplicant\u2019s failures to disclose his marijuana and LSD possession and use on his \nSCA were not alleged in the SOR. I find that Applicant unintentionally failed to disclose \nhis illegal drug involvement on his SCA.   \n \nApplicant used marijuana and LSD after he completed his SCA and had his OPM \ninterview. \u201cAn applicant who uses marijuana after having been placed on notice of its \nsecurity significance, such as using after having completed a clearance application, may \nbe lacking in the qualities expected of those with access to national secrets.\u201d ISCR Case \nNo. 17-03191 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 26, 2019) (citing ISCR Case No. 17-04198 at 2 (App. \nBd. Jan. 15, 2019) (\u201cAn applicant\u2019s misuse of drugs after having been placed on notice of \nthe incompatibility of drug abuse with clearance eligibility raises questions about his or \nher judgment and reliability\u201d)).   \n \nApplicant possessed and used marijuana in 2021 and LSD on February 13, 2021.  \nHe did not describe any drug-abuse counseling or treatment. At his hearing, he indicated \nhe does not plan or intend to use illegal drugs in the future; however, I have lingering \nconcerns about his future marijuana and LSD possession and use, particularly because \nhis spouse continues to be involved with marijuana. Guideline H security concerns are \nnot mitigated at this time. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n  \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), \u201c[t]he ultimate determination\u201d of whether to grant a security \nclearance \u201cmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines\u201d and the whole-person concept. My comments under Guideline H are \nincorporated in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that guideline but some warrant additional comment. \n \n\n \n9 \n                                         \n \nApplicant is a 34-year-old industrial engineer who has worked for the same \ndefense contractor since 2013. In 2012, he received a bachelor\u2019s degree in industrial and \nsystems engineering. His grades in graduate school have been excellent. He is in the \nprocess of earning a master\u2019s degree in engineering technical management. There is no \nevidence of security violations, employee discipline, arrests, or alcohol abuse. \n \nApplicant received positive performance evaluations, which indicate he is an \noutstanding employee who has made important contributions to the success of his \nemployer. He is an intelligent, talented, professional, and diligent high performer who is \nan innovative problem solver. His credit report does not contain any negative financial \ninformation, and his credit score is 761. He cares for his mother, who was injured in a fall \nin 2021. The general sense of Applicant\u2019s letters of recommendation are that he is diligent, \nprofessional, trustworthy, responsible, reliable, and intelligent. He has outstanding \ncommunication skills, judgment, and leadership. His character evidence provides \nimportant support for his future access to classified information. \n \nApplicant\u2019s first description to security officials of his history of involvement with \nillegal drugs was to an OPM investigator. He did not test positive on a urinalysis test, and \nhe does not have any drug-related arrests. An honest and candid self-report of drug abuse \nis an important indication that, if granted security clearance eligibility, the individual would \ndisclose any threats to national security, even if the disclosure involves an issue that \nmight damage his or her own career or personal reputation. However, the mitigating \nweight of Applicant\u2019s disclosures is undermined by his subsequent marijuana and LSD \nuse after his OPM interview, and after he was notified that he was granted access to \nclassified information in August 2020.     \n \nIt is well settled that once a concern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s security \nclearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption against granting a security clearance. \nSee Dorfmont, 913 F. 2d at 1401. \u201c[A] favorable clearance decision means that the record \ndiscloses no basis for doubt about an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 18-02085 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan. 3, 2020) (citing ISCR Case \nNo. 12-00270 at 3 (App. Bd. Jan. 17, 2014)).  \n \nI have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Egan, Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, \nthe AGs, and the Appeal Board\u2019s jurisprudence to the facts and circumstances in the \ncontext of the whole person.    \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n  \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT  \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a and 1.b:   \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n\n \n10 \n                                         \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s \neligibility for access to classified information. Eligibility for access to classified information \nis denied. \n \n \n______________________ \nMark Harvey \nAdministrative Judge \n",

On \nNovember 30, 2021, the Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency Consolidated \nAdjudications Facility (DCSA CAF) sent him a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging \nsecurity concerns under Guidelines F and E.

(GX 4 at 33.) His clearance \nwas restored in July 2021. (GX 5 at 1.) \nThe SOR alleges six delinquent debts reflected in credit reports from August \n2022, February 2021, and August 2020. (GX 7, 8, and 9). The evidence concerning these \ndebts is summarized below: \nSOR \u00b6 1.a: auto loan placed for collection of $38,537. Applicant bought a two-\nyear-old luxury car in 2018. He was unable to make the payments and voluntarily \nsurrendered the car. When he responded to DOHA interrogatories in April 2021, he \nstated that he surrendered the car in February 2021. (GX 4 at 3.) In his SOR response, \nhe stated that he paid off this debt in February 2021. At the hearing, he testified that he \nwas unable to make the payments because his wife was not working outside the home \nand he was assisting his elderly parents. He testified that the car was surrendered in \nmid-2020. (Tr. 31-32.) After the hearing he submitted evidence that he settled this \naccount for less than the full balance in August 2022. (AX 10.) \nSOR \u00b6 1.b: auto loan charged off for $14,508. The August 2022 credit report \nreflects that this debt was charged off for $11,120, and that the last activity on the \naccount was in March 2019. In Applicant\u2019s response to the SOR, he disputed this debt. \nHe denied ever having a loan from this lender and he stated that he suspected identity \ntheft. He testified that he hired a law firm to dispute the debt. (Tr. 35.) He submitted no \nevidence reflecting that he disputed the debt with the creditor or the credit bureau or that \nhe reported identity theft to any law enforcement agency. When he was interviewed by \na security investigator in October 2019, he admitted that he incurred the debt with this \ncreditor when he traded in a 2014 model car for a 2016 model, and he told the \ninvestigator that the debt had been resolved. (GX 2 at 29.) After the hearing, he \nsubmitted documentation that the debt was settled for less than the full amount on \nFebruary 10, 2022. (A-11.) \nSOR \u00b6 1.c: utility bill placed for collection of $753. The February 2021 credit \nreport reflects that this debt was referred for collection in February 2019. (GX 8 at 2.) It \nis not reflected in the August 2022 credit report. (GX 7.) After the hearing, Applicant \nsubmitted a statement reciting that he contacted the creditor by telephone and was told \nthat his account was closed three years ago, which is consistent with the February 2021 \ncredit report reflecting that the original creditor closed the account when it was placed \nfor collection. However, the evidence does not establish that the collection account was \nresolved. Applicant testified that he paid the debt with a credit card, but he did not provide \ndocumentation of payment. (Tr. 39.) The debt is not resolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.d: medical bill placed for collection of $257. The credit report from \nAugust 2022 reflects a medical bill referred for collection of $539.

Applicant was hired \nby a former employer as a full-time employee in May 2021. The SOR alleges that he was \nterminated from employment for concealing that he held at least two full-time jobs in \nviolation of company policy. He admitted this allegation in his answer to the SOR. In his \nemployment agreement, he agreed that he would not perform services for compensation \nfor any other entity without the express and written consent of the company president. \n(GX 24 at 4.) He was terminated for violation of this provision in June 2021. (GX 22; GX \n24 at 4.) \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he explained that he was helping his wife with \nher online business, and that while he was in an online meeting, his employer overheard \nhim talking to his wife about her business. His supervisor asked him if he was doing other \nwork, and he admitted that he was helping his wife with her business calls. At the hearing, \nhe testified that he was promoted from being an engineer to a managerial position, even \nthough he preferred a hands-on engineering job. With the encouragement of his wife, he \nfound and accepted a second job where he would work as an engineer. He told the first \nemployer that he intended to give them a two-week notice and take the second job, and \ntwo days later he received his termination letter. (Tr. 19-21.) \nSOR \u00b6 2.b: Removal from working on a contract for misusing government \nequipment to send inappropriate emails to a female colleague. Applicant denied this \nallegation in his answer to the SOR, and explained that he was fired because he used \nhis government computer to invite a female colleague to have lunch together. At the \nhearing, he testified that the only inappropriate email he sent was to his manager, telling \nthe manager that he needed to take off from work for a couple of days because his \ngirlfriend was cheating on him. (Tr. 21-22.) He admitted that he had a girlfriend for a short \ntime while he and his wife were having marital difficulties. (Tr. 58-59.) \nSOR \u00b6 2.c: Falsification of an SCA by failing to disclose the employment and \nconduct alleged in SOR \u00b6 2.b. During a security interview in October 2019, Applicant \nwas questioned extensively about his employment record, but he was not questioned \nabout this incident, and he did not volunteer any information about it. At the hearing, he \ntestified that he did not disclose this incident in his SCA because the accusation was \nfalse. (Tr. 64.) \nSOR \u00b6 2.d: Falsification of an SCA by failing to disclose the debts alleged in \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.f.

(Tr. 22-23.) \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.e-2.m: Traffic Offenses. Applicant admitted all the traffic offenses \nexcept the offense alleged in SOR \u00b6 2.l, which he denied. The evidence concerning these \noffenses is summarized below. \nSOR \u00b6 2.e: Reckless driving in December 2015 by driving a vehicle 94 miles per \nhour (mph) in a 55 mph zone. Applicant pleaded nolo contendere. He was convicted, his \ndriver\u2019s license was suspended for 90 days, and he paid a $500 fine plus court costs. \n(GX 10.) At the hearing, he testified that he was speeding because of an emergency at \nwork when someone tried to hack into his employer\u2019s computer network. (Tr. 70.) \nSOR \u00b6 2.f: Following too closely and driving without a valid license in January \n2018. Applicant forfeited collateral of $163 for the first offense and $188 for the second. \n(GX 11.) At the hearing, he denied committing these offenses. He testified that the police \nofficer was tailgating him and pulled him over because he was driving too slowly. He was \ndriving his wife\u2019s car and did not have his driver\u2019s license with him. (Tr. 24.) \nSOR \u00b6 2.g: Driving 79 mph in a 55 mph zone in April 2018. Applicant pleaded \nguilty and paid a $160 fine. (GX 12.) At the hearing, he admitted this incident and \nexplained that he was hurrying because he was late for work. (Tr. 24.) \nSOR \u00b6 2.h: Driving 71 mph in a 55 mph zone in November 2018. Applicant \nprepaid $163 in fines and court costs. (GX 13.) He testified that he was running late for \na church event. (Tr. 24-25.) \nSOR \u00b6 2.i: Driving 93 mph in a 55 mph zone in February 2019. Applicant pleaded \nguilty, received probation before judgment, and paid a $290 fine plus court costs. (GX \n14.) In response to DOHA interrogatories, he disclosed that his probation before \njudgment also included not driving for 30 days. He explained that he was speeding \nbecause he was running late for a church event. (GX 2 at 6.) \nSOR \u00b6 2.j: Driving 76 mph in a 55 mph zone in June 2019. Applicant pleaded not \nguilty but was convicted. The court records do not reflect the sentence. (GX 15.) In \nresponse to DOHA interrogatories, he stated that he was fined $125. (GX 2 at 6.) At the \nhearing, he testified that he was driving a friend\u2019s car and did not realize how fast he was \ndriving. (Tr. 25.) \nSOR \u00b6 2.k: Driving 116 mph in a 60 mph zone in August 2019. Applicant pleaded \nguilty. Court records do not reflect the sentence. (GX 16.). He testified that his wife was \npregnant and had fallen down some stairs, and he was rushing home to care for her.

The record contains no information reflecting \nthese offenses. Applicant denied this offense in his answer to the SOR. At the hearing, \nhe testified that the police were chasing a driver with a similar car, that the officer stopped \nhim and realized that he had stopped the wrong driver, and that he was not charged with \nany offenses. (Tr. 26.)    \nSOR \u00b6 2.m: Driving 100 mph in a 55 mph zone, unsafe passing on the right of an \novertaken vehicle, and driving in violation of a restricted license. Applicant pleaded not \nguilty, but he was convicted of all three offenses. (GX 17.) He testified that he was fined \n$530 for speeding, $100 for unsafe passing, and $70 for violating the terms of his \nrestricted license. He testified that he was not wearing his glasses at the time, even \nthough his driver\u2019s license required it. (Tr. 26-27.) \nUncharged traffic offenses: In November 2021, Applicant was cited for driving 103 \nmph in a 55 mph zone. He denied driving 100 mph because he has a device in his car \nthat alerts him if he exceeds 85 miles per hour, and it was not triggered. (A-16.) He \npleaded guilty to speeding and paid a $150 fine. (GX 18; AX 15.) In July 2022, he was \ncharged with a misdemeanor for driving 99 mph in a 55 mph zone. The citation was \npending disposition at the time of the hearing. (GX 19; Tr. 78.)3 \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.n: Falsification of an SCA by failing to disclose the traffic \nviolations involving a fine of $300 or more, alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.e and 2.k. Applicant \nadmitted this allegation and attributed it to being tired and having a cold when he \ncompleted the SCA. The evidence reflects that he was fined $500 for the offense alleged \nin SOR \u00b6 2.e. However, the court records do not reflect the amount of the fine imposed \nfor the offense alleged in SOR \u00b6 2.k, and Applicant testified that he was fined $250 for \nthat offense. The evidence shows that Applicant was fined more than $300 for the traffic \noffense alleged in SOR \u00b6 2.m, but failure to disclose this violation was not alleged in the \nSOR. I conclude that SOR \u00b6 2.n is partially established for the traffic offense alleged in \nSOR \u00b6 2.e but not for the traffic offense alleged in SOR \u00b6 2.k. \nOn August 22, 2020, Applicant completed a four-hour aggressive driver\u2019s course. \n(AX 21.) On August 25, 2020, he completed a state-administered driver improvement \nprogram. (Tr. 27-28; AX 17-20, 22, 23.) \nApplicant testified that he and his wife currently have joint family income of about \n$300,000 per year before taxes, and they have no financial issues. (Tr. 86-87.) About \ntwo months before the hearing, Applicant purchased an expensive sports car financed \nwith a loan for $107,000. (Tr. 80.) The monthly payments are about $2,300. A credit \n3 The traffic offenses that were not alleged in the SOR may not be an independent basis for revoking \nApplicant\u2019s security clearance, but they may be considered to assess his credibility; to decide whether a \nparticular adjudicative guideline is applicable; to evaluate evidence of extenuation, mitigation, or changed \ncircumstances; to consider whether he has demonstrated successful rehabilitation; or as part of a whole-\nperson analysis.

Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. \n10865 \u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the \napplicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense \nhave established for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability.

An individual who is \nfinancially overextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or \notherwise questionable acts to generate funds. . . . \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nApplicant gave inconsistent and conflicting information about his delinquent debts \nduring the adjudication process. However, the evidence establishes that for several \nyears, he was financially overextended and was unable to keep up with his debts. He \neventually reached the point where he and his wife had substantial income, but he \ncontinued to neglect his financial obligations. His admissions and the evidence submitted \nat and after the hearing establish the following disqualifying conditions under this \nguideline: \nAG \u00b6 19(a): inability to satisfy debts; \nAG \u00b6 19(b): unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; \nand \nAG \u00b6 19(c): a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were \nlargely beyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \nAG \u00b6 20(c): the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling \nfor the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \ncredit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem \nis being resolved or is under control; \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \nAG \u00b6 20(e): the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy \nof the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \nAG \u00b6 20(a) is not established.

An applicant who claims \nthat a delinquent debt has been resolved is expected to present documentary evidence \nto support his or her claim. See ISCR Case No. 15-03363 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 19, 2016). \nAG \u00b6 20(e) is not established. Applicant initially disputed the delinquent auto loan \nalleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b, but he admitted it during his security interview in October 2019 \nand settled it in February 2022. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 15: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. . . .  \nThe following disqualifying conditions under this guideline are relevant: \nAG \u00b616(a): deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant \nfacts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history \nstatement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine \nemployment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine national \nsecurity eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; \nAG \u00b6 16(c): credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue \nareas that is not sufficient for an adverse determination under any other \nsingle guideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-\nperson assessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual may not \nproperly safeguard classified or sensitive information; and \nAG \u00b6 16(d): credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under \nany other guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information, \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply \nwith rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nindividual may not properly safeguard classified or sensitive information. \nThis includes, but is not limited to, consideration of . . . :(2) any disruptive, \nviolent, or other inappropriate behavior; [and] (3) a pattern of dishonesty or \nrule violations . . . . \nAG \u00b6 16(a) is established. When a falsification allegation is controverted, as in \nthis case, the Government has the burden of proving it. An omission, standing alone, \ndoes not prove falsification. An administrative judge must consider the record evidence \nas a whole to determine an applicant\u2019s state of mind at the time of the omission. See \nISCR Case No. 03-09483 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 17, 2004). An applicant\u2019s experience and \nlevel of education are relevant to determining whether a failure to disclose relevant \ninformation on a security clearance application was deliberate. ISCR Case No. 08-05637 \n(App. Bd. Sep. 9, 2010). Applicant is a mature adult and an experienced federal \ncontractor employee. He has submitted SCAs on several occasions and is familiar with \nthe security clearance process. His testimony at the hearing was replete with efforts to \nminimize and excuse his culpability for his debts and his personal conduct. His claim that \nhe was too tired and too sick to pay attention to the questions in the SCA is not credible. \nAG \u00b6 16(d) is not applicable to Applicant\u2019s traffic offense alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.e, \nwhich was a misdemeanor explicitly covered under Guideline J (Criminal Conduct), but \nit is applicable to all of the remaining traffic offenses alleged in the SOR. His failure to \nfollow the rules at his places of employment and his individual speeding tickets might not \nindividually be sufficient for an adverse determination, but when they are considered as \na whole, they support an assessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, and unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations. \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \nAG \u00b6 17(a): the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \nAG \u00b6 17(c): the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior \nis so infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is unlikely \nto recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment; and \nAG \u00b6 17(d): the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained \ncounseling to change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, unreliable, \nor other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur. \nAG \u00b6 17(a) is not established. Applicant did not attempt to correct the omissions \nin his SCA until he was confronted with the evidence during an interview with a security \ninvestigator. \n11 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 17(c) is not established. Applicant\u2019s falsification of his SCA is arguably \n\u201cinfrequent\u201d because it involves only one SCA. However, it is not \u201cminor,\u201d because it \n\u201cstrikes at the heart of the security clearance process.\u201d ISCR Case No. 09-01652 (App. \nBd. Aug. 8, 2011.) It did not occur under unique circumstances. It was recent, because \nit affected Applicant\u2019s pending application. Applicant\u2019s termination of employment in June \n2021 was an isolated, minor incident. His termination from working on a contract in July \n2017 is mitigated by the passage of time, and the minor nature of the conduct. His traffic \nviolations are arguably \u201cminor\u201d individually, but they are numerous, recent, and \ndemonstrate a pattern of disregard for rules and regulations. \nAG \u00b6 17(d) is not established. Applicant has acknowledged his behavior, but he \nwas not particularly remorseful at the hearing. The fact that he set the speed monitor in \nhis car at 85 mph indicates that he intends to continue driving well over the speed limit. \nHis online driver improvement courses are commendable, but the timing suggests that \nthey were motivated by his desire to keep his security clearance rather than modify his \ndriving habits. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F and E in my whole-person \nanalysis and applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). After weighing the \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions under those guidelines and evaluating all the \nevidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the \nsecurity concerns raised by financial delinquencies and personal conduct. \n12 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): AGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.c: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.d-1.f: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E, Personal Conduct: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a and 2.b: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 2.c-2.n: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.

Applicant has been married \nsince February 2015. \nNone of Applicant\u2019s children reside with him. \n(Government \nExhibit 4.) \nIn his answer to the SOR, Applicant failed to provide any explanation for his \nexcessive delinquent indebtedness. He also failed to provide any information showing \nany attempts on his part to contact the creditors and repay or resolve his delinquent \ndebts. \nApplicant failed to disclose any of these delinquent debts on his 2020 security \nclearance application. During his subject interview in December 2020, he discussed a \ndelinquent car loan and three medical accounts. \nThe following delinquent debts set forth in the SOR are of security concern: \n1.a.  A delinquent debt is owed to a state department of social service for child support \narrearage in the amount of $14,970.  Applicant had an active warrant that was issued in \nJanuary 2020 for unpaid child support.  The warrant was recalled by the court in \nDecember 2020.  Applicant explained to the Government investigator that he had never \nbeen delinquent on child support, but that he stopped paying and had not paid since \nFebruary 2019.  Applicant claims that the notice to appear in court and other documents \nwere sent to his former residence and he subsequently missed his court date.

Applicant\u2019s monthly child support \npayment is $490 which began in August 2016.  (Government Exhibit 4.)  Other \ndocumentation provided by Applicant from the state division of child support \nenforcement dated June 25, 2021, shows that regarding Case #0003583637, Applicant \nhas a current total balance of $14,970.81, owed to the parent custodian and $196 owed \nto the state.  His monthly payment is $339.23 which began in March 2013.  There is no \nevidence in the record that shows that he has started making payments toward the debt \nyet.  (Government Exhibit 4.) \n1.b. A delinquent debt is owed to a creditor that was placed for collections in the \napproximate amount of $8,042. The debt remains owing. (Government Exhibits 5 and \n6.) \n1.c. A delinquent debt is owed to a creditor that was charged off in the approximate \namount of $2,500. The debt remains owing. (Government Exhibits 5 and 6.) \n1.d. A delinquent medical account was placed for collection in the approximate amount \nof $938. The debt remains owing. (Government Exhibits 5 and 6.) \n1.e.

(Government Exhibits 5 and 6.) \n1.g. A delinquent debt medical account was placed for collection in the approximate \namount of $65. The debt remains owing. (Government Exhibits 5 and 6.) \nApplicant has failed to provide any evidence in mitigation. He has not made a \ngood faith effort to address his delinquent debts nor has he taken any meaningful step \nto resolve the delinquencies. \nHe has failed to show that he has made even one \npayment toward resolving his debts. \nFurthermore, he has failed to provide evidence \nshowing that his current financial situation is under control and that there is no risk of \nrecurrence of the financial problems at issue. \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance \ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to \npotential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F -  Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for Financial Considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n   \n \n \n \n \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. Two are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant is indebted to a number of creditors for delinquent accounts totaling in \nexcess of $24,000 that have been placed for collection or are in arrears. The evidence \nis sufficient to raise the above disqualifying conditions. \nThe following mitigating conditions under the Financial Considerations guideline \nare potentially applicable under AG \u00b6 20: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely\nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g. loss of employment, a business\ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce, or\nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;\nand    \n \n \n \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant is delinquently indebted to each of the creditors set forth in the SOR. \nHe has failed to provide any evidence in mitigation. This shows poor judgment and \nunreliability. Accordingly, Applicant does not meet the requirements to access classified \ninformation. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances.

I conclude Applicant has not \nmitigated the Financial Considerations security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a. through 1.g: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s national \nsecurity eligibility for a security clearance.

He has a 27-year-old son, \na 21-year-old daughter, and a 17-year-old son. He has been living with his partner since \nApril 2019. He graduated from high school in 1992. He earned an associate\u2019s degree in \n2021, and he is currently working toward a bachelor\u2019s degree in cybersecurity.

Additionally, he owes the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) \n$8,364 for tax year (TY) 2013 (SOR \u00b6 1.c), $5,576for TY 2014 (SOR \u00b6 1.d), and $3,762 \nfor TY 2015 (SOR \u00b6 1.e). He admitted these allegations. He denied that he owes \nmunicipal income taxes in the amount of $7,878 (SOR \u00b6 1.f). He admitted two of the \nadditional SOR debts, totaling $1,710 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.g and 1.i) and denied three debts, \ntotaling $980 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.h, 1.j, and 1.k). (Answer) \nApplicant attributes his financial issues to the early 2000s, when he fell behind on \npaying child support for his oldest two children to their mothers. He and his oldest son\u2019s \nmother had a legal agreement that each of them would claim their son as a dependent \nevery other year; however, she consistently received her W-2 before him and claimed \ntheir son on the years Applicant was entitled to claim him. His federal tax debt started to \naccrue as a result, and he \u201cnever rebounded\u201d from this period. At an unrecalled date, he \ncontacted the IRS, and they put him in a non-collectible status. Additionally, he struggled \nto pay his mortgage and other bills, and, as a result, he filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy \nprotection in 2005. His liabilities totaled $93,066, and included $4,000 of child support \npayments, $500 of tax debt, and almost $8,500 in other unsecured debt. He has had no \nperiods of unemployment in the past five years. (GE 2 at 6; GE 9; Tr. 19-20, 25-31, 60, \n63) \nIn Applicant\u2019s October 2020 SCA, he disclosed his 2015 Chapter 7 bankruptcy. \nAdditionally, he disclosed an unalleged Chapter 13 bankruptcy petition that he filed in \nMarch 2018. He reported no additional bankruptcies, debts, or tax issues. (GE 1; Tr. 66) \nIn December 2020, Applicant was interviewed by a Government investigator. He \ntold the investigator that he filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy protection in 2015 due to falling \nbehind on his mortgage and other debts when he lost his job for a few months. His total \nliabilities were $60,000, and included over $33,000 in federal and state income tax debt. \nHe also filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy protection in 2018, because he was overwhelmed \nby his child support obligations and other bills. His liabilities were $30,000, and he had \n$25,000 in tax debt.

(GE 2 at 6-9; GE \n3; GE 7; Tr. 63) \nApplicant responded to DOHA interrogatories in April 2021, and adopted the \nstatement referenced above. He also provided IRS account statements for TY 2011 \nthrough 2019. According to these statements: \nTY 2011: filed late in October 2012 \nBalance: $0 (resolved 6/24/2019) \nTY 2012: Filed late in September 2014 Balance: $0 (resolved 5/4/2020) \nTY 2013: Filed late in February 2015 \nBalance: $8,259 (SOR \u00b6 1.c) \nTY 2014: Filed late in June 2015 \nBalance: $5,506 (SOR \u00b6 1.d) \nTY 2015: (W-2) \nTY 2016: Filed late in May 2017 \nBalance: $3,644 (SOR \u00b6 1.e) \nTY 2017: Filed April 2018  \nBalance: $0 \nTY 2018: Filed late in June 2019  \nBalance: $0 \nTY 2019: Filed in May 2020 \nBalance: $0 (GE 2; Tr. 28-30) \nAt the hearing, Applicant admitted he failed to file his federal income tax returns in \na timely manner for several years. In addition to his son\u2019s mother claiming their son on \nher returns for years when Applicant was entitled to claim their son, which affected \nApplicant\u2019s taxes, he also failed to have an adequate amount withheld from his \npaychecks. This also contributed to his debt to the IRS. He testified that for several years, \nhe was in non-collectible status, however, since approximately 2017, he has been in a \npayment agreement with the IRS, and is paying $278 monthly directly out of his checking \naccount. (GE 1; Tr. 20, 28-38) \nAccording to Applicant, his outstanding balance with the IRS is approximately \n$16,000. The documents in the record and the amounts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c through \n1.e, reflect that the balances for some of the TY have decreased. The IRS tax transcripts \nreflect that in the past, Applicant established multiple payment agreements, but they were \nterminated due to his failure to pay them. Applicant did not provide proof of his payments, \nwhen the payments started, or the number of payments he has made. The IRS tax \ntranscripts reflect credits for overpayment were transferred from TY 2016 to 2019 to TY \n2011 to 2013, but no active payments were made to Applicant. (For TY 2016, after an \noverpayment was transferred to TY 2011, additional taxes, interests, and fees were \nassessed against Applicant.) The record was left open, in part, to allow him to provide \ndocumentation regarding his payments to the IRS. (GE 2; Tr. 20, 28-38) \nDepartment Counsel produced evidence that Applicant filed Chapter 13 \nbankruptcy protection in 2001, 2002, 2003, and 2018. These bankruptcies were \ndismissed in March 2003, August 2003, August 2004, July 2018, respectively. Applicant \ntestified that he did file these bankruptcy petitions, and they were not alleged in the SOR. \nI will not consider them as disqualifying conduct, but may consider them in determining if \nthe mitigating conditions are applicable and in my whole-person analysis.

(Tr. 20, 24-25) \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe concern under Guideline F (Financial considerations) is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . . .   \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the documentary evidence establish the following \ndisqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 19: \n(a) Inability to satisfy debts;  \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income\ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as\nrequired.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20 describes conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following \nare potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s financial issues started due to child support obligations for his oldest \ntwo children and ongoing conflict with his son\u2019s mother regarding her violation of their \nchild dependency agreement. These tax issues and ongoing financial problems led to him \nfiling for Chapter 7 bankruptcy protection in 2005 and again in 2015, and his debts were \ndischarged twice. \nApplicant\u2019s tax issues are current, ongoing, and recent. He testified that he has \nbeen making payments toward his federal tax debt since 2017, and his balance is \n$16,000. However, he failed to provide substantiating documentation of an installment \nagreement and payments toward the agreement, despite the record specifically being left \nopen to allow him to do so. Additionally, the tax transcripts in GE 2 demonstrate that in \nthe past he entered into multiple installment agreements with the IRS, and they were \nremoved, demonstrating a pattern of noncompliance. \nGiven Applicant\u2019s lengthy history of financial issues, he has not demonstrated he \nhas acted responsibly under the circumstances to address and resolve his tax issues and \nother financial obligations. Additionally, he provided limited proof of payment or resolution \nfor several of his delinquent consumer debts. Mitigation under AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), 20(b), and \n20(g) was not established. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances \nsurrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-\nperson analysis. Applicant failed to provide documentation to establish that he is paying \nhis federal taxes. He has a lengthy history of financial issues, as demonstrated by his \n2005 and 2015 Chapter 7 bankruptcy discharges. Overall, he has not demonstrated the \nactions of a responsible, reliable, and trustworthy person. I conclude he did not meet his \nburden of proof and persuasion. He failed to mitigate the financial considerations security \nconcerns. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n__________________________ \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:   \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.e: \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.f: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.g: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.h \u2013 1.j: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.k: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest of the United \nStates to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nEligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nCAROLINE E.

She earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in 1995. She has worked as \nan engineer for her employer, a DOD contractor, since 1995, but her medical issues since \n2017 affected her ability to work full-time, as further discussed below. She returned to \nwork full-time in July 2022. She has held a security clearance since 1996. (Answer; Tr. at \n5, 7-9, 30-31, 46-50, 55, 66, 69; GE 1) \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant had eight delinquent consumer debts totaling \n$56,284 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a - 1.h) and a $62 delinquent medical debt (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.i). The SOR \nallegations are established by Applicant\u2019s admissions in her Answer, her 2020 security \nclearance application (SCA), a June 2020 background interview, and by credit bureau \nreports from 2020 and 2021.

She subsequently received a $19,000 \nsettlement, which she applied toward the expenses that accrued while she was on short-\nterm disability. From January to May 2020, her employer again placed her on short-term \ndisability. She earned approximately $45,000 during this period. From March to July 2022, \nher employer placed her on short-term disability for a third time. She earned \napproximately $46,000 during this period. (Tr. at 32, 37-38, 45-50, 52-53, 55, 58-69; GE \n1, 2) \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b are for two charged-off credit cards with the same creditor, \nfor $25,560 and $11,350, respectively. Applicant used these credit cards to pay for \nhousehold expenses. She stated in her SCA and indicated during her background \ninterview that she was in the process of settling both debts.

(Tr. at 43-50, 52-53, 55, 62-69; AE E, F, G, \nM) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 \n2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national \nsecurity eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship\ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government\nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk\nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information.\nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential,\nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7 of Exec. Or.\n10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall\nin no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also\nExec. Or. 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or\nsensitive information).   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . .. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant was unable to pay her debts. The evidence is sufficient to raise AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n19(a) and 19(c). \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nConditions beyond Applicant\u2019s control contributed to her financial problems. The \nfirst prong of AG \u00b6 20(b) applies. For the full application of AG \u00b6 20(b), she must provide \nevidence that she acted responsibly under her circumstances. She has resolved SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.d, 1.f, 1.h, and 1.i and she was in the process of resolving SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, and 1.e. \nAfter making a payment to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c and 1.g, the creditor notified her that it had closed \nboth accounts with a zero balance. She established good-faith efforts to repay her debts. \nHer finances are under control and they no longer cast doubt on her judgment, \ntrustworthiness, and reliability. I find that \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), 20(b), 20(c), and 20(d). \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances \nsurrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-\nperson analysis. Overall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as \nto Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant \nmitigated the financial considerations security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.i: \nFor Applicant \n Conclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance. \nEligibility for access to classified information is granted. \nCandace Le\u2019i Garcia \nAdministrative Judge \n6 \n",

(AE A, B, G) \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe security concern for drug involvement and substance misuse is set out in AG \n\u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d \nas defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term \nadopted in this guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 25. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); and \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                          \n \nApplicant possessed and used marijuana from 2013 through November 2019. He \npossessed and used cocaine and MDMA at a music festival in 2018. The above \ndisqualifying conditions are applicable. \nSOR \u00b6 1.e alleges that Applicant was discharged from the military \u201cfor fraudulent \nenlistment based on drug paraphernalia found at [his] residence and testimony stating \n[he] had a history of drug use [he] failed to disclose upon entry into the armed services.\u201d \nI conclude that the SOR alleges both his preservice drug use and his possession of \ndrug paraphernalia. \nApplicant denied using any illegal drugs before he was discharged from the \nmilitary. There is some evidence supporting Applicant\u2019s position, most notably his \nsister\u2019s statement that the pipes belonged to her, his ex-wife\u2019s pondering whether to \nrecant her statement, and his negative drug test. After considering all the evidence, I \nfind by substantial evidence1 that the pipes belonged to Applicant. My finding is \nprimarily based on the reports by the E-6, who had a discussion with Applicant, and the \nO-4, who overheard the discussion. I also note that Applicant smoked marijuana in \nabout September 2013, or about six months after his discharge. AG \u00b6 25(c) is \napplicable as it relates to SOR \u00b6 1.e. \nAG \u00b6 26 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following \nare potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \nand \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; \nand \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \n1 Substantial evidence is \u201csuch relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to \nsupport a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the same record.\u201d See, e.g., ISCR Case No. \n17-04166 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 21, 2019) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1). \u201cThis is something less than the \nweight of the evidence, and the possibility of drawing two inconsistent conclusions from the evidence \ndoes not prevent [a Judge\u2019s] finding from being supported by substantial evidence.\u201d Consolo v.

There are no \nbright-line rules for when conduct is recent. All of Applicant\u2019s illegal drug use might be \nmitigated if I had found him credible, but I did not. Falsus in uno, falsus in omnibus \n(false in one thing, false in everything) is not necessarily true, but it is sufficient to cause \npause and leave lingering doubts on a close case. \nApplicant\u2019s conduct continues to cast doubt on his current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, good judgment, and willingness to comply with laws, rules, and \nregulations. The above mitigating conditions, individually or collectively, are insufficient \nto alleviate those concerns. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct  \nThe security concern for personal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 15, as follows: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying conditions are potentially applicable: \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-\nperson \nassessment \nof \nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual may not \nproperly safeguard classified or sensitive information; and \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress by a \nforeign intelligence entity or other individual or group. Such conduct \nincludes: \n(1) engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the person\u2019s \npersonal, professional, or community standing. \nApplicant\u2019s history of drug involvement is cross-alleged under Guideline E. His \nillegal drug use reflects questionable judgment and an unwillingness to comply with \nrules and regulations. The conduct also created vulnerability to exploitation, \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nmanipulation, and duress. AG \u00b6 16(e) is applicable. AG \u00b6 16(c) is not perfectly \napplicable because Applicant\u2019s conduct is sufficient for an adverse determination under \nthe drug involvement guideline. However, the general concerns about questionable \njudgment and an unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations contained in AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n15 and 16(c) are established. \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following \nare potentially applicable: \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely \nto recur; and \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress. \nPersonal conduct security concerns about Applicant\u2019s drug involvement are not \nmitigated based on the same analysis discussed above under Guideline H. The above \nmitigating conditions are insufficient to overcome ongoing concerns about Applicant\u2019s \njudgment, reliability, trustworthiness, and honesty. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \ncomments under Guidelines E and H in my whole-person analysis.

I conclude Applicant did not \nmitigate the security concerns under Guidelines E (personal conduct) and H (drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse). \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.e: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \na security clearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact The SOR alleges under Guideline G (SOR \u00b6 1), and cross-alleges under Guideline J (SOR \u00b6 2.a), that Applicant was convicted of a January 2020 driving under the influence (DUI) offense (SOR \u00b6 1.a); that, while intoxicated, he was arrested in September 2018 for breach of peace for which he had to complete an alcohol-intervention course (SOR \u00b6 1.b); and that, while intoxicated, he was arrested in May 2018 for disorderly conduct for which he had to complete court-ordered community service (SOR \u00b6 1.c). Applicant is also alleged under Guideline G to have consumed alcohol at time to excess and intoxication from about May 2018 to at least January 2020 (SOR \u00b6 1.d). Applicant provided a detailed response in which he admitted the arrests and detailed the circumstances of each incident. He submitted in mitigation that he had reduced his drinking from previous levels and that he had been assessed and found to not need a substance abuse or alcohol-intervention program. (AE A.) After considering the pleadings, exhibits, and transcript, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant is a 25-year-old college graduate with a bachelor\u2019s degree in national security studies. During the summer of 2018, following his junior year of college, and again during his semester break in January 2019, he worked as an intern for his current employer, a defense contractor. In early June 2019, he began full-time employment for a company that contracted his services to his current employer. (G",

Connelley, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n07/19/2022 \nDecision \nMATCHINSKI, Elizabeth M., Administrative Judge: \nApplicant drank alcohol irresponsibly at times. He allowed alcohol to negatively \nimpact his judgment on a few occasions, most notably in January 2020, when he was \narrested for drunk driving. He has moderated his drinking, and his desire to retain his \ndefense-contractor employment is a strong motivator against recurrence of abusive \ndrinking. Clearance eligibility is granted. \nStatement of the Case \nOn June 25, 2021, the Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency (DCSA \nCAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, detailing security concerns \nunder Guideline G, alcohol consumption, and Guideline J, criminal conduct. The SOR \nexplained why the DCSA CAF was unable to find it clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant or continue security clearance eligibility for him. The DCSA CAF took the \naction under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense (DOD) Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines for \n1 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \nDetermining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive \nPosition (AG) effective within the DOD on June 8, 2017. \nOn September 20, 2021, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations and \nrequested a hearing before an administrative judge from the Defense Office of Hearings \nand Appeals (DOHA). Referral of the case to the Hearing Office was delayed because of \nthe COVID pandemic. On February 4, 2022, a DOHA Department Counsel indicated that \nthe Government was ready to proceed to a hearing. On February 24, 2022, the case was \nassigned to me to conduct a hearing to determine whether it is clearly consistent with the \nnational security interests of the United States to grant or continue a security clearance \nfor Applicant. I received the case file and assignment on March 1, 2022. \nAfter some coordination with the parties, on May 12, 2022, I scheduled a hearing \nfor June 8, 2022. At the hearing, five Government exhibits (GE 1 through 5) and 15 \nApplicant exhibits (AE A through O), including Applicant\u2019s response to the SOR as AE A, \nwere admitted into the record without any objections. Applicant and his supervisor \ntestified, as reflected in a hearing transcript (Tr.) received on June 23, 2022. \nFindings of Fact \nThe SOR alleges under Guideline G (SOR \u00b6 1), and cross-alleges under Guideline \nJ (SOR \u00b6 2.a), that Applicant was convicted of a January 2020 driving under the influence \n(DUI) offense (SOR \u00b6 1.a); that, while intoxicated, he was arrested in September 2018 for \nbreach of peace for which he had to complete an alcohol-intervention course (SOR \u00b6 1.b); \nand that, while intoxicated, he was arrested in May 2018 for disorderly conduct for which \nhe had to complete court-ordered community service (SOR \u00b6 1.c). Applicant is also \nalleged under Guideline G to have consumed alcohol at time to excess and intoxication \nfrom about May 2018 to at least January 2020 (SOR \u00b6 1.d). \nApplicant provided a detailed response in which he admitted the arrests and \ndetailed the circumstances of each incident. He submitted in mitigation that he had \nreduced his drinking from previous levels and that he had been assessed and found to \nnot need a substance abuse or alcohol-intervention program. (AE A.) \nAfter considering the pleadings, exhibits, and transcript, I make the following \nfindings of fact. \nApplicant is a 25-year-old college graduate with a bachelor\u2019s degree in national \nsecurity studies. During the summer of 2018, following his junior year of college, and \nagain during his semester break in January 2019, he worked as an intern for his current \nemployer, a defense contractor. In early June 2019, he began full-time employment for a \ncompany that contracted his services to his current employer. (GE 5.) He began working \nas a direct hire of his defense-contractor employer in December 2020 in a position of \ngreater responsibility than he held as a contractor. (AEs A, K; Tr. 13, 74.) He holds a \nsecret clearance (Tr. 42), although the date it was granted is not in evidence. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant drank to excess at times while he was in college, especially during his \nsophomore year. (AEs A, G; Tr. 82-85.) He drank to the point of blacking out \u201conce every \nfew months.\u201d (Tr. 83.) There were nights when he drank too much and did not drink \nresponsibly. (Tr. 85.) \nIn May 2018, Applicant consumed four to five alcohol drinks while celebrating the \nend of his junior year in college with some high school friends at a local bar. When he left \nthe bar, he walked over to a vehicle that was the same make and model as a friend\u2019s \nvehicle. Mistakenly thinking a friend was there to pick him up, he opened the passenger \ndoor and attempted to enter the vehicle. The driver exited the vehicle, started a verbal \naltercation, and it escalated into a shoving match. Applicant was arrested for \nmisdemeanor disorderly conduct. (GE 5; AE A; Tr. 51-52.) He informed his current \nsupervisor about the incident when he was being hired for his summer internship. (Tr. \n29.) \nIn June 2018, the charge was dismissed, and the record of the charge was sealed, \nin exchange for Applicant completing ten hours of community service. Applicant continues \nto believe that the charge was expunged from his record. (Tr. 54.) The police jurisdiction \ninvolved indicates that the charge was expunged from its records, but the court records \nshow that Applicant\u2019s record was sealed. (AE D.) Applicant fulfilled the community service \nrequirement by recording the names and locations of veterans buried in a couple of \ncemeteries and placing flags at their graves. (GEs 1, 5; AEs A, C; Tr. 53-54.) The task \ntook him over 20 hours to complete. (AE C.) Applicant now understands that he should \nhave walked away when the driver exited his vehicle. His alcohol consumption and his \npride contributed to his actions that night as he was not one to back down at the time. \n(AE A.; Tr. 52-53.) \nIn September 2018, Applicant was visited in college by some friends from high \nschool. He went with them to a bar, where he consumed some alcohol before proceeding \nto a barbecue restaurant where he hung around with his ex-girlfriend of about one month. \nShe had come from a Happy Hour and was likely intoxicated. She asked him about any \ncontacts with other females, and at her request, he gave her his cell phone. She became \nangry and agitated on seeing some texts on his phone to another female. Whether \nintentionally or not, she hit him in the face with a glass, causing some lacerations to his \nnose. (GE 5; AE A; Tr. 56-57.) A friend of Applicant\u2019s, who was present at the time, \nindicates that Applicant did not instigate or escalate the incident and that Applicant \nremained calm and did not react. (AE E.) Applicant admits, however, that after she threw \nthe glass at him causing injury, he felt \u201cbetrayed\u201d and yelled at her. (Tr. 58.) The police \ncame with an ambulance. Fearing the cost of the ambulance ride, and not thinking clearly \nbecause of the assault and the alcohol he had consumed, he refused the instructions of \nthe police to get into the ambulance and was charged with breach of peace in the second \ndegree. Because he had been assaulted, he considered the charge unfair, but he wanted \nto put it behind him. On the advice of his attorney, he accepted a plea deal. In return for \ndismissal of the charge, he was required to submit himself for an alcohol assessment and \nto comply with any recommended alcohol-intervention program or substance-abuse \ntreatment. (GEs 1, 5; AE A; Tr. 59-60.) \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant was assessed for substance abuse on November 6, 2018, by a licensed \nprofessional counselor at an outpatient substance-abuse intervention facility. He reported \nthat he thought he had a problem with alcohol during his sophomore year of college in \nthat he found himself \u201chaving more in one night,\u201d but he \u201cgot over that.\u201d He reported that \nhe had used alcohol in 10 of the previous 30 days and averaged four beers or four or five \nmixed drinks per occasion. At the time, Applicant was struggling with risk factors including \nhis legal involvement, living in an environment where alcohol use was prevalent, and \nsocializing with a group of friends who drink. He appeared motivated to complete court \nrequirements, including any treatment, and had a supportive family and friends. The \nclinician assessed him with mild alcohol use disorder and recommended that he attend \nweekly intervention treatment starting on November 12, 2018, to explore the \nconsequences of his alcohol use, and to also attend individual sessions with the clinician. \n(AE G.) \nThe clinician told Applicant that he was required by the court to attend \u201cthe \nminimum amount,\u201d which consisted of an eight-week course with weekly urinalysis to \nensure he was abstaining from alcohol. Applicant was required to only attend six weeks \nso that he could finish it before his winter break from college. Applicant successfully \ncompleted intervention and individual services on December 12, 2018 (GE 1; AE F, Tr. \n61), and the charge was dismissed in January 2019. (Tr. 62.) \nOn April 28, 2019, Applicant completed and certified as accurate a Questionnaire \nfor National Security Positions (SF 86) for a secret-level clearance for his duties as a \ncontractor in his current employer\u2019s security department. Applicant reported the May 2018 \ndisorderly conduct and September 2018 breach of peace charges, which were dismissed. \nAbout the September 2018 incident, he stated, in part: \nI was charged with breach of peace second degree for technically being in \na bar fight, despite me not striking or attempting to strike anyone physically. \nI did verbally yell at the girl after the glass hit my face. The court was \nconcerned that I might have provoked the incident as a result of my drinking \nthat night so we made an agreement for me to take an alcohol intervention \nclass in exchange for the charges [sic] to be dropped against me. I did this, \nbelieving it to be the faster option between that and pursuing a court case \nagainst her. Upon the initial screening at the intervention I was told I did not \nneed any classes but we opted to take the least serious classes anyway. I \npassed the course with zero incidents and the case was dismissed. (GE 1.) \nIn response to an SF 86 inquiry into whether he had ever been ordered, advised, \nor asked to seek counseling or treatment as a result of his use of alcohol, Applicant \nindicated that he took an alcohol-intervention course from October 2018 to December \n2018, and stated: \nI made a deal with the family affairs court to do an alcohol intervention \ncourse to prove that I was not an alcoholic who was provoking altercations. \nUpon my initial screening [with] the treatment organization, I was verbally \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ntold that they did not believe that any treatment was necessary but I went \non with the least intensive course in order to honor the agreement made \nwith the court. During that time, I also remained sober. (GE 1.) \nApplicant discussed the May 2018 and September 2018 incidents during a May \n28, 2019 interview with an Office of Personnel Management (OPM) investigator. He \nadmitted that he had consumed three or four beers before the May 2018 incident, and his \nalcohol consumption may have affected his judgment. He told the investigator that he \ndrank two or three beers with dinner before the September 2018 incident, but he did not \nbelieve his consumption of alcohol played any role in that incident. Applicant told the \ninvestigator that he was currently drinking two or three beers per week, usually in social \nsettings with friends, but he never drank more than one beer if he has to drive. He claimed \nthat he had consumed alcohol to intoxication only three times: twice at age 18, when he \nfirst tried alcohol and had three shots of whiskey and then when he had three or four \nbeers at a house party; and one other time when he was in college and drank four or five \nbeers at a house party on campus. He denied that he had a drinking problem and asserted \nthat he drank responsibly. (GE 5.) \nOn a Saturday night in January 2020, Applicant drank alcohol to intoxication while \nwatching football playoffs at a friend\u2019s house. He now recalls having consumed two mixed \ndrinks and three or four beers. (Tr. 63.) His friends all decided to stay over, and told him \nnot to drive home. After they had all gone to bed, Applicant made a very poor decision to \ndrive home around 2:00 a.m. on that Sunday, because he and his father planned to go to \na basketball game later that day. He was pulled over for speeding 75 miles per hour \n(MPH) in a posted 35 MPH zone. He exhibited signs of intoxication, and he told the police \nthat he had consumed \u201ca few beers.\u201d He failed field sobriety tests (Tr. 64) and was \narrested for DUI-first offense with a blood-alcohol content (BAC) of .15 or greater and for \nspeeding. His BAC tested at .174% initially and then .171% a few minutes later. (GE 2; \nAE A.) When he went to work on that Monday, he reported his arrest to his security \nmanager. (AE A; Tr. 30.) The security manager, who knew about Applicant\u2019s two incidents \nin 2018 (Tr. 30-31) but believed Applicant was not at fault in the September 2018 incident \n(Tr. 38), was \u201cdevastated and surprised\u201d to learn of Applicant\u2019s arrest for DUI. (Tr. 42.) \nThe company made a timely report to the DCSA CAF of the arrest involving Applicant. \n(GE 3.) \nApplicant pled no contest to the DUI and was ordered to complete his state\u2019s driver \nretraining program; comply with an alcohol assessment and any treatment recommended; \ncomplete 20 hours of community service; and pay a fine of about $500. His driver\u2019s license \nwas to be suspended for 30 days, but on his application, he was granted a hardship \nlicense to drive to and from work with an Interlock device installed on his vehicle. He had \nno violations of the Interlock device. In July 2020, the device and all driving restrictions \nwere removed. For his community service, Applicant cleaned a trailer owned by the scout \ntroop through which he had attained the rank of Eagle Scout. (AEs H-I; Tr. 66-67.) \nAt the start of the driver\u2019s training program, Applicant was assessed on November \n9, 2020, via a virtual platform due to COVID-19, by a licensed chemical dependency \n5 \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nprofessional (LCDP). He admitted that he was intoxicated on the occasion of his January \n2020 arrest and that he made a bad decision to operate a motor vehicle. He reported \ncurrent consumption of three or four drinks once a week. He denied any urges to drink \nalcohol or any withdrawal symptoms. While the clinician believed Applicant might have a \nmild alcohol use disorder, she did not refer him to substance abuse counseling, but opined \nthat he would likely benefit from driving while intoxicated (DWI) classes to reduce the risk \nof recidivism and to gain education and insight. (AE J.) Applicant attended the classes, \nwhich he indicates were required of all first-time offenders in the driver retraining program, \nin December 2020. (AEs A, J; Tr. 68.) Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the DWI classes \nwere delayed and eventually held online. (AEs A, J.) With his completion of the classes, \nApplicant fulfilled all the requirements of his sentence for the DUI. (Tr. 68.) Applicant \nconsiders his decision to drive after drinking to intoxication in January 2020 the worst \ndecision of his life to present. (Tr. 69.) \nApplicant was re-interviewed for the OPM on June 8, 2020. About his January \n2020 arrest, Applicant told the investigator that he had consumed four beers and two \nmixed drinks while at a friend\u2019s house watching football. He admitted that he had been \nstopped for speeding and failed field sobriety tests; that while he initially pled not guilty to \nDUI, he pled nolo contendere in early March 2020. He explained that his family, \nsupervisor, co-workers, and current girlfriend were all aware of his arrest. He denied any \nchance of recurrence as he had learned his lesson and did not want to jeopardize his \nemployment and security clearance. When asked to detail his alcohol use since his \nprevious interview conducted in May 2019, he stated that prior to his January 2020 arrest, \nhe drank three or four days per week in quantity of three to four drinks at a sitting; that he \nbecame intoxicated half the time; and that his drink of choice was and still is beer and \nIrish whiskey. He explained that he had taken no steps to reduce his alcohol consumption \nas he did not see his drinking to be a problem. After his DUI, he continued to drink beer \nand whiskey but in quantity of only two or three drinks at a time, and only once a week, \nusually on Friday nights after work. He stated that he reduced his alcohol consumption \nafter discussing his arrest and the impact of his drinking with his supervisor. (GE 4.) \nAt his hearing, Applicant testified that he did not always drink responsibly when he \nwas younger, but it did not rise to the level of a substance-abuse problem: \nI\u2019ll fully admit when I was younger and less responsible of my alcohol that I \nhad issues and I didn\u2019t behave as appropriately with it as I do now. But there \nwas no substance abuse issue that I had that directly caused these issues. \nAlcohol certainly contributed, but it wasn\u2019t an issue that I ignored or \notherwise let get out of control that caused these instances. But just \nbecause I did not have a problem with these doesn\u2019t mean that I didn\u2019t take \nwhat happened very seriously. (Tr. 70.) \nApplicant presently drinks alcohol only on the weekends, but not every weekend. \nHe no longer drinks to intoxication because he realizes the trouble it caused him, and he \ndoes not want to jeopardize his employment or security clearance eligibility. (Tr. 73, 89-\n90.) He drank one beer at a social function with co-workers on June 4, 2022. (Tr. 88.) \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant no longer socializes with the college friends with whom he drank in \ncollege. (Tr. 91.) He continues to socialize with the high school friends with whom he \ndrank on the occasion of his DUI, and he went to a concert with them in August 2021 \nwhere at least one of his friends became intoxicated. Applicant drank one beer that night. \nHe made sure that this friend arrived home safely. These friends know of his arrest for \nDUI and do not pressure him to drink more. (Tr. 94-95.) \nApplicant bought a house in May 2022. (Tr. 13, 99.) He is currently in a cohabitant \nrelationship with his girlfriend. They began dating in April 2019. His girlfriend consumes \nalcohol but not on a regular basis. (Tr. 92.) \nCharacter References \nApplicant currently runs the badge control and visitor management office for their \nfacility, and he is directly managed by the supervisor for security services. This supervisor \nauthored character reference letters for Applicant in September 2018 (AE B) and \nSeptember 2021 (AEs A, K), and he also testified. (Tr. 28-42.) He gives Applicant his \nhighest recommendation, having observed Applicant as a summer intern, contract \nemployee, and as a direct hire into the security department. This security manager \nconsiders Applicant to be \u201cone of the most amazing people [he has] ever met in [his] \nprofessional career.\u201d Applicant has demonstrated his value to their department. Willing to \nhelp others and take on extra tasks, he has a work ethic which the supervisor considers \nas \u201cnothing short of amazing.\u201d The supervisor asserts that he \u201ccannot think of anyone \nmore loyal and trustworthy to have in that position.\u201d (AEs A, K; Tr. 35-36.) Applicant timely \nreported the incidents in the SOR to him, including that alcohol was involved, although \nnot the details of the quantities of alcohol consumed. (Tr. 29-30.) At the time, the \nsupervisor scolded him (\u201cI was point blank with him. But then I beat him up a little bit. I \ndusted him off, then I put him back to work.\u201d). (Tr. 42.) He believes Applicant made \u201ca \nfew bad judgment calls as he was transitioning from a young adult,\u201d and deserves a \nsecond chance. Applicant has shown \u201cextreme remorse,\u201d and has taken responsibility for, \nand learned from, his mistakes. (AEs A, K; Tr. 31-36.) The supervisor has socialized with \nApplicant outside of work and has seen him consume alcohol. Applicant drank \nresponsibly in those instances. (Tr. 39-40.) The supervisor testified that he will fight for \nApplicant to stay in his department should Applicant lose his clearance eligibility. (Tr. 40.) \nThe assistant FSO has also been familiar with Applicant\u2019s work performance since \n2018. She was charged with delegating and assigning some tasks to Applicant during his \ninternship, and he displayed a great work ethic. In 2021, she sat on his interview board \nfor a permanent position with their employer. Applicant impressed her as someone who \nwill progress within the company. As the facility\u2019s badge control officer, he works daily \nwith personally identifiable information (PII) and sensitive information (including classified \ninformation). The assistant FSO has never questioned Applicant\u2019s ability to properly \nhandle and safeguard that information. He takes national security \u201cextremely seriously.\u201d \n(AEs A, O.) He completed PII training on December 8, 2021. (AE N.) \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe chief of the human resources at Applicant\u2019s worksite found Applicant \u201cunique \nin his professionalism and poise, even as a young intern.\u201d Applicant paid attention to detail \nin every task assigned, and he stood out as a very good teammate. As a contractor, and \nnow as a member of the security team, he continued to demonstrate his value to their \nemployer. (AEs A, L.) \nA co-worker with whom Applicant has worked closely indicates that Applicant has \nbeen \u201cdiligent, attentive to detail, dependable, reliable, and an absolute professional.\u201d A \nself-starter, Applicant sees projects through to their completion. He has also been a \nreliable and dependable friend to this co-worker. (AEs A, M.) \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion the Executive \nBranch has in regulating access to information pertaining to national security, \nemphasizing that \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy \nv. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security \nclearance, the administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be \nconsidered in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of \nhuman behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the \nadjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overall adjudicative goal is a fair, \nimpartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a \nconscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d \nThe administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the \nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present \nevidence to establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \nthe applicant is responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, \nexplain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department \nCounsel. . . .\u201d The applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable \nsecurity decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation about potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7 of EO 10865 \nprovides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be \na determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section \n3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline G: Alcohol Consumption \nThe security concern about alcohol consumption is set forth in AG \u00b6 21: \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about \nan individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness. \nApplicant drank to excess at times, most notably during his sophomore year in \ncollege in 2016, when he blacked out from drinking once every few months, and on the \noccasion of his January 2020 DUI. His consumption of four to five alcohol drinks with \nsome high school friends in May 2018 led to his arrest for disorderly conduct after he \nbecame involved in a shoving match with a driver whose vehicle he attempted to enter. \nAlcohol was also involved in a September 2018 incident where he was assaulted by an \nex-girlfriend. Although Applicant was not the aggressor, he refused the instructions of \npolice on that occasion, and he was arrested for breach of peace second degree. \nFollowing the incident, Applicant was diagnosed with mild alcohol use disorder. He \ncompleted an alcohol-intervention course, during which he abstained from alcohol as \nrequired, but once the program was over, he resumed drinking. Between May 2019 and \nJanuary 2020, he drank alcohol three or four days per week in quantity of free to four \ndrinks at a sitting, becoming intoxicated about half of the time. Then, while watching \nfootball with some friends in January 2020, he became heavily intoxicated, as evidenced \nby his BAC of .174% after being stopped for speeding and arrested for DUI. A LDCP \nevaluated him for the court and opined that he might have a mild alcohol use disorder, \nbut he was found to not need treatment beyond the DWI classes. \nThe evidence falls short of demonstrating that Applicant has an alcohol problem \nthat warranted his participation in an alcohol-rehabilitation program. Even so, AG \u00b6 22(d), \n\u201cdiagnosis by a duly qualified medical or mental health professional (e.g., physician, \nclinical psychologist, psychiatrist, or licensed clinical social worker) of alcohol use \ndisorder,\u201d is established by his diagnosis of mild alcohol use disorder. Moreover, his \nirresponsible use of alcohol between 2016 and early 2020 triggers the security concerns \nunder AG \u00b6\u00b6 22(a) and 22(c), which provide: \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under \nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other \nincidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the individual\u2019s alcohol \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nuse or whether the individual has been diagnosed with alcohol use disorder; \nand \n(c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired \njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed with alcohol \nuse disorder. \n\u201cBinge drinking is the most common pattern of excessive alcohol use in the United \nStates.\u201d See the Center for Disease Control website, (stating \u201cThe National Institute on \nAlcohol Abuse and Alcoholism defines binge drinking as a pattern of drinking that brings \na person\u2019s blood alcohol concentration (BAC) to 0.08 grams percent or above. This \ntypically happens when men consume 5 or more drinks, and when women consume 4 or \nmore drinks, in about 2 hours.\u201d), https://www.cdc.gov/alcohol/fact-sheets/binge-\ndrinking.htm. Applicant engaged in binge drinking when he drank to the point of blacking \nout and before his DUI. \nUnder \u00b6 E3.1.15 of the Directive, Applicant has the burden to produce evidence to \nrebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the security concerns. AG \u00b6 23 provides for \nmitigation under the following conditions: \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment; \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive alcohol \nuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and has \ndemonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or \nabstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations; \n(c) the individual is participating in counseling or a treatment program, has \nno previous history of treatment and relapse, and is making satisfactory \nprogress in a treatment program; and \n(d) the individual has successfully completed a treatment program along \nwith any required aftercare, and has demonstrate a clear and established \npattern of modified consumption or abstinence in accordance with treatment \nrecommendations. \nApplicant\u2019s May 2018 mistake in assuming that the car in the May 2018 belonged \nto his friend is something that could occur whether or not alcohol was involved. As far as \nthe pushing of the driver is concerned, Applicant testified that he was not one to back \ndown from an insult. However, alcohol clearly had an impact on his behavior that day. \nRegarding the incident in September 2018, a witness to Applicant\u2019s behavior that night \ncorroborates that Applicant did nothing to instigate or escalate the incident. His refusal to \ncomply with the instructions of the police appear largely due to concerns over the cost of \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nthe ambulance. While alcohol may have had an impact on Applicant\u2019s behavior, for \npurposes of assessing Guideline G, it was minor in that instance. Applicant\u2019s January \n2020 DUI was isolated as far as evidence of drunk driving is concerned, but AG \u00b6 23(a) \ncannot reasonably apply because the DUI is too recent and too serious. \nFactors other than alcohol played a part in Applicant\u2019s 2018 arrests, which led to \na lack of insight by Applicant about the extent to which alcohol could jeopardize his future. \nHe displayed some minimization of his alcohol use during his May 2019 OPM interview. \nHowever, there is significant evidence of mitigation since his January 2020 DUI that \nestablishes AG \u00b6 23(b). With the DUI and the scolding from his supervisor, Applicant \ncame to realize that irresponsible drinking could have negative impacts on his future. It \nmotivated him to reduce his alcohol consumption in both frequency and quantity. \nApplicant\u2019s supervisor attests to Applicant\u2019s growth since the incident and his remorse for \nthe incident. Applicant has established a pattern of modified consumption for the past 2.5 \nyears. To the extent that he met two of the diagnostic criteria for mild alcohol use disorder \n(i.e., alcohol use in hazardous situations and increased tolerance), his mild alcohol use \ndisorder would be considered to be in sustained remission under the Diagnostic and \nStatistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM 5) in that none of the criteria \nfor alcohol use disorder have been met at any time during a period of 12 months or longer. \nHe is seen as not likely to jeopardize his job by abusing alcohol in the future. The alcohol \nconsumption security concerns are mitigated. \nGuideline J: Criminal Conduct \nThe security concern about criminal conduct is articulated in AG \u00b6 30, \u201cCriminal \nactivity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. By its \nvery nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability or unwillingness to comply with laws, \nrules, and regulations.\u201d Although the record of the May 2018 offense was sealed, and the \nSeptember 2018 charge was dismissed following his completion of the terms of his plea \nagreement, it does not immunize them from consideration in assessing his security \nclearance eligibility. Applicant does not dispute that he committed a serious misdemeanor \nby drunk driving in January 2020. Two disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 31 apply. They \nare: \n(a) a pattern of minor offenses, any one of which on its own would be \nunlikely to affect a national security eligibility decision, but which in \ncombination cast doubt on the individual\u2019s judgment, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness; and \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted. \nApplicant\u2019s January 2020 DUI is too recent to be mitigated under \u00b6 32(a), which \nstates: \n11 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment. \nThe high quality of Applicant\u2019s work for his employer, and the absence of any \nalcohol-related behaviors on the job provide considerable evidence of rehabilitation in this \ncase under AG \u00b6 32(d), which provides: \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation, including, but not limited \nto the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \nTo the extent that mitigation has been shown, the risk of recurrence of criminal \nconduct depends largely on whether he can be relied on to drink responsibly in the future \nand not allow his drinking to negatively affect his judgment. The efforts Applicant has \ntaken to moderate his alcohol consumption are positive evidence in that regard. The \ncriminal conduct security concerns are mitigated for the same reasons they are mitigated \nunder the alcohol consumption guideline, supra. \nWhole-Person Concept \nIn assessing the whole person, the administrative judge must consider the totality \nof Applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative \nprocess factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). Those factors are: \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nThe analyses under Guidelines G and J are incorporated in my whole-person \nanalysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were addressed under those guidelines, but \nsome warrant additional comment. \nAlthough it does not justify his alcohol-related incidents, Applicant\u2019s irresponsible \ndrinking occurred when he was in his early 20s. His youth and socialization with others of \nlike age who consumed alcohol clearly impacted his decision making. Applicant\u2019s value \nto his employer is undisputed. The adverse impact of a clearance decision on an applicant \nor his employer is not a relevant consideration in determining national security eligibility. \n12 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________ \nSee, e.g., ISCR Case No. 19-01759 at 3 (App. Bd. June 8, 2020) (citing ISCR Case No. \n11-13180 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 21, 2013)). The security clearance adjudication involves \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness in light of the security \nguidelines in the Directive. See ISCR Case No. 09-02160 (App. Bd. Jun. 21, 2010). In \nthat regard, Applicant is credited with timely notifying his supervisor about his arrests. He \ntold his manager about his May 2018 disorderly conduct when he was being considered \nfor his summer internship. On the Monday following his DUI arrest over the weekend, he \ntold his supervisor about his arrest. He has demonstrated that he can be counted on to \ncomply with the requirement to report issues of security concern, even when it is \npersonally disadvantageous. \nMoreover, after the DUI, Applicant continued to hold a secret clearance. He has \ncontinued to handle classified and sensitive information, including PII, appropriately and \naccording to security procedures. After considering all the evidence in this case, I find \nthat it is clearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant security \nclearance eligibility. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline G: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.d: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline J: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is clearly consistent with the interests of \nnational security to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance. \nEligibility for access to classified information is granted. \nElizabeth M.

China is an authoritarian state in which the Chinese Communist Party \nis the paramount authority. China has expansive efforts in place to acquire U.S. \ntechnology to include secrets and proprietary information. About 80 percent of all \neconomic espionage prosecutions brought by the U.S. Department of Justice relate to \nthe Chinese state.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the whole-person concept. The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nA person who applies for access to classified information seeks to enter into a \nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \nSection 7 of Executive Order (EO) 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall \nbe \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the \nloyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information). \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline B - Foreign Influence \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Foreign Influence is set out in \nAG \u00b6 6: \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they \nresult in divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern \nif they create circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to \npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign \ncontacts and interests should consider the country in which the foreign \ncontact or interest is located, including, but not limited to, considerations \nsuch as whether it is known to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or \nsensitive information or is associated with a risk of terrorism. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 7. Three are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the \nindividual's desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing \nthat information or technology; and \n(e) shared living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of \ncitizenship status, if that relationship creates a heightened risk of foreign \ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion. \nApplicant\u2019s wife and in-laws are Chinese citizens. The evidence is sufficient to \nraise these disqualifying conditions. \nAG \u00b6 8 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I considered all \nof the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 8 including: \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nUnited States; \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest; and \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation. \nOther than his wife, Applicant has little contact with foreign nationals, to include \nhis in-laws. His wife lives and works in the United States. His loyalties clearly lie with the \nUnited States as testified to by his supervisor (TR at page 45 line 18 to page 49 line 7), \nand attested to by a retired Major General (AppX H). \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline B in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \nApplicant has a distinguished history of working in the defense industry and is \nrespected by his superiors and colleagues. He performs well at his job. (AppXs A~D, \nand G and H.)

In his Answer, Applicant admitted the allegations with \nexplanations. The details regarding each of the allegations under this adjudicative \nguideline (AG) are as follows: \n1.a Mental health treatment from June 2009 to about March 2010 \u2013 By mid-\n2009, Applicant\u2019s anxiety \u201cwas out of control.\u201d He was drinking alcohol heavily at the time.\nHe experienced additional stress due to an arrest for driving under the influence of alcohol\n(DUI) in November 2008 (SOR subparagraph 2.c). His relationship with his girlfriend was\nalso causing him stress. From June 2009 to June 2010, he received outpatient mental\nhealth treatment for his anxiety.

(Answer at 2; Tr. \nat 48-49; GE 4 at 3; GE 6 at 20, 24, 29.) \n1.b Involuntary mental health treatment beginning in August 2010, following \nan episode of anxiety and hallucinations \u2013 A couple of months later, Applicant was \ninvoluntarily hospitalized following an episode of anxiety and hallucinations. He reported \nhearing \u201cmany voices\u201d saying they will \u201ckill him.\u201d He was using alcohol excessively at the \ntime to self-medicate. Applicant was hospitalized after he searched in the area near his \nhome looking for the sources of the voices. When he could not find them, he experienced \nsuicidal thoughts and cut his arms several times. His roommate became concerned and \ncalled an ambulance. His therapist diagnosed Applicant with \u201cdepression/psychosis\u201d and \n\u201calcohol induced psychosis.\u201d When his involuntary commitment terminated, he continued \nvoluntary inpatient treatment for about a week. He then continued with outpatient \ntreatment until February 2011. He was prescribed medications for depression, but he did \nnot want to stay on the drugs. He testified that his therapist at the time agreed that he \nshould stop taking prescription drugs, and he did. He also stopped his treatment with his \ntherapist due to his loss of insurance coverage because of a change of employers. At that \ntime, he was not drinking alcohol. (Tr. at 50-59; GE 4 at 3; GE 6 at 10, 15, 16.) \n1.c Mental health treatment from about July 2014 to October 2014 for a \ncondition diagnosed as social anxiety \u2013 Applicant continued without counseling or \nmedication until July 2014. He does not recall why he sought mental health treatment at \nthat time. He testified that he might have been having difficulties with co-workers. He also \nadmitted that he had started drinking alcohol in early 2014. He decided to seek treatment \nfor his social anxiety. He did not explain why he stopped this treatment in October 2014. \nAs discussed below, he was arrested and charged with his third DUI in October 2014. He \nstopped his mental health treatment that same month. (Tr. at 56-60, 71; Answer at 3.) \n1.d Inpatient mental health treatment from March 2018 to April 2018 for \nalcohol detoxification and treatment for hallucinations \u2013 From October 2014 to March \n2018, Applicant received no mental-health treatment, although he participated in an 18-\nmonth court-ordered alcohol program as a result of his October 2014 DUI. For a period \nprior to March 2018, he resumed using alcohol to self-medicate. He was under stress at \nwork due to an allegation made against him by a female co-worker. In March 2018, he \nvoluntarily admitted himself into a treatment facility for alcohol detoxification because he \nrealized he was drinking \u201ca little too much\u201d and was starting to hear voices again, though \nhe testified that the voices were not as loud as in 2010. He remained hospitalized for \nseven days and then was referred to an outpatient program for aftercare. According to \nthe records, he was diagnosed with alcohol use disorder and alcohol withdrawal. He \ntestified, however, that his use of alcohol was never discussed when he was hospitalized. \nHe testified that he was only treated for social anxiety. He was prescribed medications \nand saw his physician monthly for several months and then once every three months. He \nreturned to working a night shift at his job, which helped relieve his social anxiety. He \nbelieved that he no longer needed the medications. He did not like how they made him \nfeel. He testified that the drugs made him lose his motivation.

He testified that the Covid-\n19 restrictions in his state made it difficult for him to obtain his medications. He was feeling \nbetter so he did not \u201cfight\u201d to get the drugs. He did not want to take the drugs for his \nanxiety. He testified: \n[W]hen you have anxiety, you\u2019re gonna get worked up at certain times and \nthat\u2019s the only times you need that medication and that\u2019s the only - - you \nknow, ideal medication, that would be the perfect time and it would just kick \nin and work and calm me down. But it does that constantly. \nYou take it every day so you\u2019re calm and even calmer when you are already \ncalm, so there goes your energy.  \n(Tr. at 76.) \nAfter he stopped taking his medication in 2020, he began drinking again. He would \ndrink a beer or two at home with his father. He stopped drinking two or three months prior \nto the hearing. He started going to the gym about the same time. He has not sought any \ncounseling for his anxiety. Now that he understands that his job is at risk without a \nclearance, he does not intend to drink alcohol. He is dealing with his anxiety as best as \nhe can. He admitted that he was extremely stressed learning about the date of the hearing \nin this case. Without medication or counseling, he does not have a specific plan for \ndealing with future stressful situations that cause him anxiety. He does better now with \nhis parents living with him and working a night shift when there are fewer co-workers \naround him. He testified that drinking alcohol is not a good solution to his anxiety, though \nin a moment of complete candor, he admitted that drinking helps temporarily after a day \nfull of stress. He testified that it was not difficult for him to stop drinking in the past. He \nclaimed that drinking is not an important part of his life. He further testified that if he cannot \ndeal with his anxiety, he has no problem seeking help from a mental health counselor \u201cas \nlong as they\u2019re not trying to push medication.\u201d He also admitted that he has never been \ngiven the option to participate in extended periods of individual counseling for his mental \nhealth condition. (Tr. at 66-73, 86-92.) \n1.e November 2020 mental health evaluation by a licensed psychologist with \na diagnosis of social anxiety disorder and alcohol use disorder, mild/moderate \u2013 \nThe CAF requested Applicant submit to a psychological evaluation in connection with his\napplication for a security clearance. The evaluation by a licensed psychologist took place\nin November 2020. The psychologist diagnosed Applicant with social anxiety disorder and\nalcohol use disorder, mild/moderate.

In his Answer, Applicant admitted the allegations, with \none exception (SOR subparagraph 2.e), and provided additional information. The details \nregarding each of the allegations under this adjudicative guideline (AG) are as follows: \n2.a Consumed alcohol, at times in excess and to the point of intoxication,\nfrom 1996 to at least November 2020 \u2013\n \n Applicant began drinking alcohol on the day of \nhis graduation from high school in 1996. He drank excessively and blacked out. After he \nenlisted in the Navy, he started binge drinking following his initial training when he was \n19 or 20 years old. He continued on and off drinking, often to the point of intoxication, \nuntil two of three months prior to the hearing. He has also had extended periods of \nsobriety over the past 25 years, typically while he was participating in court-ordered \nclasses and while seeing a therapist.

He was convicted and sentenced to \nattend an alcohol education class and six months of Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) \nmeetings. Applicant was uncomfortable in the group setting of AA meetings, and he did \nnot have a sponsor. He was also sentenced to five years of probation and fined. He \ncompleted all of the requirements of his sentence.

His BAC was .24%. He was again convicted. The \ncourt sentenced Applicant to serve four days in jail and five years on probation. He was \nalso ordered to attend an 18-month DUI program and AA meetings and was fined. His \ndriver\u2019s license was suspended for one year. (SCA at 33; Tr. at 76-77; GE 2 at 5; GE 3 at \n3; GE 4 at 2; Answer at 4.) \n2.d October 2014 arrested for DUI \u2013 Prior to his third DUI arrest, Applicant was \ndrinking alone at his residence when his girlfriend arrived. He was drinking alcohol to \nrelieve stress and anxiety. He had completed his probation from his second arrest. He \nhad an argument with his girlfriend and left the home in his car. His vehicle hit a telephone \npole and stopped. The police arrived and arrested him. He was convicted and sentenced \nto serve four days in jail, to attend an alcohol education program, and an 18-month \ncounseling program. He was also ordered to attend AA meetings. He was again \nsentenced to serve five years on probation and was fined. He was on probation at the \ntime he submitted his application for a clearance.

In his \nprognosis, the psychologist concluded that Applicant continued to drink alcohol even \nthough Applicant \u201crecognizes that alcohol may have a deleterious effect on him.\u201d He wrote \nfurther: \n[Applicant] continues to consume alcohol and while this may be a response \nto his heightened anxiety, it still places him at risk and likely hinders his \nengagement in treatment that could actually produce a sustainable effect. \nAs such, [I] believe that [Applicant\u2019s] judgment and reliability are clearly \nimpacted by his diagnoses. \n(Answer at 5; GE 4 at 6.) \n2.g Continued drinking of alcohol, notwithstanding treatment for a condition \ndiagnosed as alcohol use disorder, as set forth in subparagraph 1.d, above \u2013 In his \nJuly 2021 Answer, Applicant\u2019s attorney wrote that Applicant is committed to a life of \nsobriety. Applicant had advised the psychologist in November 2020 that he had reduced \nhis drinking to weekends. He also reported that he no longer consumes stronger alcoholic \ndrinks. The psychologist correctly noted that Applicant had advised the background \ninvestigator who conducted his security clearance interview in April 2018 that he would \nnever consume alcohol again. In the investigator\u2019s interview report, Applicant stated that \nhe has sought professional help to make sure that he does not drink again. Applicant also \ntestified that he was never ordered by a court to remain sober and that sobriety was never \na requirement of the DUI programs that he was required by three courts to attend. He \nstopped drinking on his own during the periods of the three mandatory DUI classes. \n(Answer at 5; Tr. at 79-80; GE 2 at 4; GE 4 at 3.) \nMitigation and Whole Person Evidence \nSince 1996, when he was a Navy enlistee, Applicant has performed the same or \nsimilar work. He is proud of his skills and work ethic. His current and former supervisors \npraised his work and dedication to his job as a civilian contractor for the military. They \nhave never experienced any difficulties due to Applicant\u2019s consumption of alcohol or due \nto his mental health issues. He has always been reliable.

His team lead wrote that Applicant \u201cis an exemplary \nemployee and individual.\u201d (Tr. at 19-35; AE C-F.) \nApplicant provided his DD 214, which reflects that he was awarded several medals \nand ribbons during his nine years of military service. He noted proudly on his resume, \nwhich is also in the record, that he received a Letter of Commendation from his squadron \nin 2005 and a Letter of Appreciation from his Commanding Officer in 1998, as well as two \nachievement medals. (AE A at 3; AE B.)  \nPolicies \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nAdverse clearance determinations must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest \nand shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d \nExec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication \nthe applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense \nhave established for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWashington Metro.

The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \nAnalysis \nParagraph 1, Guideline I \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 27 as follows: \nCertain emotional, mental, and personality conditions can impair judgment, \nreliability, or trustworthiness. A formal diagnosis of a disorder is not required \nfor there to be a concern under this guideline. A duly qualified mental health \nprofessional (e.g., clinical psychologist or psychiatrist) employed by, or \nacceptable to and approved by the U.S. Government, should be consulted \nwhen evaluating potentially disqualifying and mitigating information under \nthis guideline and an opinion, including prognosis, should be sought. No \nnegative inference concerning the standards in this guideline may be raised \nsolely on the basis of mental health counselling. \nThe following potentially disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 28 could apply to the \nfacts of this case: \n(a) behavior that casts doubt on an individual's judgment, stability, reliability, \nor trustworthiness, not covered under any other guideline and that may \nindicate an emotional, mental, or personality condition, including, but not \nlimited to, irresponsible, violent, self-harm, suicidal, paranoid, manipulative, \nimpulsive, chronic lying, deceitful, exploitative, or bizarre behaviors; \n(b) an opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional that the \nindividual has a condition that may impair judgment, stability, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness; \n(c) voluntary or involuntary inpatient hospitalization; and \n8 \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(d) failure to follow a prescribed treatment plan related to a diagnosed \npsychological/psychiatric condition that may impair judgment, stability, \nreliability, or trustworthiness, including, but not limited to, failure to take \nprescribed medication or failure to attend required counseling sessions. \nAG \u00b6 28(a)-(c) have been established by the facts of this case. AG \u00b6 28(d) has not \nbeen fully established by direct, clear evidence of a treatment plan that Applicant has \nfailed to follow. Due to Applicant\u2019s dislike of the various medications that have been \nprescribed for him since 2009, he has not consistently taken the medications and is not \npresently taking any medication for his mental health condition. The record evidence, \nhowever, falls short of establishing this disqualifying condition, though Applicant\u2019s refusal \nto take prescribed psychiatric medications raises a security concern given his long-time \npsychiatric condition. \nThe guideline in AG \u00b6 29 contains five conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from psychological conditions. Four of these mitigating conditions have \npossible applicability to the facts of this case: \n(a) the identified condition is readily controllable with treatment, and the \nindividual has demonstrated ongoing and consistent compliance with the \ntreatment plan; \n(b) the individual has voluntarily entered a counseling or treatment program \nfor a condition that is amenable to treatment, and the individual is currently \nreceiving counseling or treatment with a favorable prognosis by a duly \nqualified mental health professional; \n(c) recent opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional employed \nby, or acceptable to and approved by, the U.S. Government that an \nindividual's previous condition is under control or in remission, and has a \nlow probability of recurrence or exacerbation; and \n(d) the past psychological/psychiatric condition was temporary, the situation \nhas been resolved, and the individual no longer shows indications of \nemotional instability. \nAG \u00b6 29(a), (b), and (c) have not been established. Applicant is not currently in \ntreatment and has no treatment plan. He has not provided a favorable prognosis by a \nduly qualified mental health professional. The only opinion of a duly qualified mental \nhealth professional in the record is that of the Government\u2019s expert, whose opinion \nsupports disqualification under AG \u00b6 28(b). \nAG \u00b6 29(d) is not established. Applicant\u2019s social anxiety has been a lifelong \ncondition that has not been resolved by medication or mental health treatment. Applicant \ncontinues to show indications of emotional instability.

In 2018, Applicant voluntarily admitted himself for \ntreatment in part due to experiencing hallucinations for the second time in his life. \nParagraph 2, Guideline G \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 21 as follows: \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about \nan individual's reliability and trustworthiness. \nThe Government\u2019s evidence and Applicant\u2019s admissions established the following \nconditions under AG \u00b6 22 that could be disqualifying: \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under \nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other \nincidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the individual's alcohol \nuse or whether the individual has been diagnosed with alcohol use disorder; \n(c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired \njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed with alcohol \nuse disorder; \n(d) diagnosis by a duly qualified medical or mental health professional (e.g., \nphysician, clinical psychologist, psychiatrist, or licensed clinical social \nworker) of alcohol use disorder; \n(e) the failure to follow treatment advice once diagnosed; and \n(f) alcohol consumption, which is not in accordance with treatment \nrecommendations, after a diagnosis of alcohol use disorder. \nAG \u00b6 22(a)-(d) have been established by the facts found above. AG \u00b6\u00b6 22(e) and \n28 (f) have not been fully established by the record evidence. There is no evidence in the \nrecord that Applicant ever received treatment advice that he should abstain from drinking \nalcohol, though it is hard to imagine that any responsible alcohol abuse counselor would \nnot have given him such advice under the circumstances set forth in the record. The \nrecord establishes that Applicant has been diagnosed with alcohol use disorder and that \nuntil recently, he continued to drink alcohol, which in the past has led to arrests for DUI \nand hospitalizations. The fact that Applicant continued to drink alcohol until he was put \non notice that his eligibility to continue at his job was in jeopardy due in part to his \ncontinued consumption of alcohol is an important fact in this case. It raises the possibility \nthat if he were to be granted a clearance, he may no longer remain abstinent with the \nrelated problems his drinking has caused him in the past. \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nThe guideline in AG \u00b6 23 contains four conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from alcohol consumption. Each of these mitigating conditions have \npossible applicability to the facts of this case: \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or \njudgment; \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive alcohol \nuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and has \ndemonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or \nabstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations; \n(c) the individual is participating in counseling or a treatment program, has \nno previous history of treatment and relapse, and is making satisfactory \nprogress in a treatment program; and \n(d) the individual has successfully completed a treatment program along \nwith any required aftercare, and has demonstrated a clear and established \npattern of modified consumption or abstinence in accordance with treatment \nrecommendations. \nAG \u00b6 23(a) is not established. Applicant\u2019s last known abuse of alcohol in 2018 was \nnot so long ago that it can be concluded with confidence that it is unlikely to recur. \nApplicant has a history of abstinence followed by periods of excessive drinking. On three \noccasions his excessive drinking resulted in the exercise of poor judgment when he drove \nunder the influence of alcohol and was arrested. Applicant\u2019s history of self-medicating \nwith alcohol, and his alcohol consumption until recently, casts doubt on his current \nreliability, trustworthiness, and judgment. \nAG \u00b6 23(b) is only partially established. Applicant has acknowledged his pattern of \nalcohol abuse and has sought counseling for his mental health condition and his alcohol \nuse disorder. He has not provided evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem \naside from claiming an intent to remain sober at the time of his interview in 2018 and \nagain in 2021 at the hearing. He has not demonstrated a clear and established pattern of \nabstinence or modified consumption nor has he acknowledged receiving any treatment \nrecommendations for his alcohol use disorder. \nAG \u00b6 23(c) is only partially established. Applicant has participated in voluntary and \ncourt-ordered alcohol counseling for many years. He is making progress, but his history \nof treatment and relapse is significant. He is not presently participating in a treatment \nprogram. His strong employment history over a number of years is not sufficient to satisfy \nhis burden to show that he is making satisfactory progress at this time. \n11 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 23(d) is only partially established.

Moreover, he has not provided \nevidence of any required aftercare or demonstrated a clear and established pattern of \nmodified consumption or abstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations. \nWhole-Person Analysis \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances and applying the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d), specifically: \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guidelines I and G in my whole-person \nanalysis and applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). Overall, the record evidence \nas described above leaves me with doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a \nsecurity clearance. After weighing the applicable disqualifying and mitigating conditions \nand evaluating all of the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant \nhas not mitigated the security concerns raised by his psychological conditions and alcohol \nconsumption. \nFormal Findings \nParagraph 1, Guideline I:   \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.e:  \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline G:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a through 2.d:  \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.e:  \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 2.f and 2.g:  \nAgainst Applicant \n12 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national interests of the United \nStates to grant Applicant national security eligibility for a security clearance.

On May 19, 2021, the Defense \nCounterintelligence and Security Agency (DCSA) Consolidated Adjudications Facility \n(CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to him under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) \n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended and modified; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended and modified (Directive); and \nDirective 4 of the Security Executive Agent (SEAD 4), National Security Adjudicative \nGuidelines (December 10, 2016) (AG), effective June 8, 2017. \nThe SOR alleged security concerns under Guidelines I (psychological conditions) \nand G (alcohol consumption), and detailed reasons why the DCSA adjudicators were \n1 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nunable to find that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a \nsecurity clearance for Applicant.

(Item 4, at 60) \nPsychological Conditions and Alcohol Consumption \nApplicant grew up in a troubled family setting with a mother \u2013 a crack cocaine and \nmarijuana user \u2013 who died of a drug overdose when he was 13-years old, and a father \u2013 \nan alcoholic \u2013 who died when Applicant was 21-years old. At the age of 18, Applicant \nconverted to a religion where alcohol was not tolerated, and it took him three to four years \nto stop drinking. (Item 3, at 3) He acknowledged that in 2008, during his third combat tour, \nhe started experiencing various unspecified symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder \n(PTSD). By 2011, he was screened for depression after his fourth combat tour, and he \nbegan seeking treatment voluntarily. However, because the treatment brought more \nflashbacks, and it frightened him, he walked away from treatment. He now admits that his \naction in quitting treatment was a mistake. The PTSD symptoms and depression \nincreased to what he called \u201ca peak\u201d in 2018 and 2019. As a result, he began to drink \nafter 26 years of complete sobriety. (Item 1, at 3) When asked by a doctor why he had \nwaited so long to wait before reporting his trauma-related effects, he responded that he \nwanted to try to document his problems without damaging his career. (Item 4, at 61) \nIn late February 2019, after his tour to Saudi Arabia, Applicant initiated counseling \nat an Army health and support center. In March 2019, he was diagnosed with major \ndepressive disorder, unspecified mood disorder, and severe alcohol abuse according to \na psychiatrist, as well as Applicant\u2019s memory. As a result of the alcohol diagnose and \nassessment, one week later he was admitted to the Substance Use Disorder Clinical Care \n(SUDCC) program under AR 600-85, The Army Substance Abuse Program (November \n26, 2016). The SUDCC program directive, setting forth the patient\u2019s obligations and \nrequirements, or the staff program protocols, do not appear in the casefile. He was also \n\u201cofficially\u201d diagnosed with PTSD in March 2019 by another doctor, and in June 2019, he \nwas treated in trauma care and prescribed three medications: Zolof (an anti-depressant), \nMinipress (an anti-anxiety to treat PTSD symptoms), and Ambien (for insomnia). (Item 1, \nat 3; Item 4, at 18, 61) Unfortunately, while these brief references to diagnoses and \ntreatments appear in the case file, there are no medical records to be reviewed to verify \nthem. \nOn August 23, 2019, while on temporary duty (TDY), he was scheduled to perform \nhis duties as Command Chief of Inspections during an Inspector General (IG) inspection \nof a military battalion. After completing some preliminary functions, and attending a \nmeeting regarding other activities that evening as well as the main inspection that was \nscheduled to take place the following day, he returned to his hotel, took his medication, \nand eventually went to dinner. After dinner, he went to a bar and consumed a double \nvodka tonic \u2013 a violation of the SUDCC program because he was to remain abstinent. He \nthen went bar-hopping, during which he consumed more alcohol, in amounts he could not \nrecall. He was aware that his phone battery had died. He intended to drive his rental car \n3 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nback to his hotel, but at about 8:30 a.m. the following morning he found himself in the \nback seat asleep. He rushed to his hotel to shower, anticipating to go to the inspection, \nbut instead, he felt light-headed and fell asleep \u2013 essentially passed out \u2013 on his bed. He \nwas awakened by a phone call from the hotel receptionist, and spoke with his inspection \nteam leader. Applicant missed most the duties of that day, arriving at 5:00 p.m. When \nsubsequently asked by his deputy for an explanation, Applicant acknowledged that he \nwas legally drunk both on August 23-24, 2019, and again on August 26, 2019, and that \nhe drove a vehicle while drunk on both occasions. When asked if he was suicidal, \nApplicant responded \u201cnot at this time.\u201d He also noted that he was a \u201cchronic liar.\u201d (Item 4, \nat 19-23, 24-28, 29-34, 48-49). On August 27, 2019, he was scheduled to appear at an \ninspection at another facility at 8:00 a.m. but failed to appear until 10:30 a.m., claiming he \nthought the meeting started at 9:00 a.m., and explaining that he got lost on the way to the \nmeeting. (Item 4, at 19-23, 24-28, 29-34, 48-49) \nAs a result of Applicant\u2019s conduct during his TDY, on September 9, 2019, an \ninvestigating officer (IO) was appointed to conduct an administrative investigation into\nallegations of misconduct during that TDY. The IO found: (1) Applicant failed to perform\nhis duties as Chief of Inspection on August 24, 2019, and that his failure was the result of\nhis voluntary abuse of alcohol the prior day; (2) his use of prescription drugs were not a\ncontributing factor to his failure to perform his duties on August 24, 2019; (3) his failure to\nreport to his assigned duties on August 27, 2019, was contributed to his use of\nprescription medication and his very recent drinking episode on August 23-24, 2019; and\n(4) he operated his vehicle in a wanton and reckless manner which had the potential to\ncause grave harm to others due to his excessive intoxication on August 23, 2019 and the\nmorning of August 24, 2019. (Item 4, at 6-8, 9-10) The IO noted that Applicant was given\na new SUDDC provider in September 2019, and that Applicant was scheduled to attend\nrehabilitation treatment for 35 days followed by a one-month program for trauma care.\nThe IO also recommended that based on his findings, Applicant: \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ndid drink excessively while in the SUDDC program, failed to perform his \nassigned duties, and in fact \u2013 wanton (sic) and recklessly drove while \nintoxicated which are violations of Articles 112 and 113 of the Uniform Code \nof Military Justice (UCMJ). In addition, recommend his IG credentials be \nrevoked, appropriate punitive actions be taken, and that he continues with \nneeded treatment until his immediate retirement from service.   \n(Item 4, at 7-8) \nThe Command Chief of Staff, a Major General, issued Applicant a General Officer \nMemorandum of Reprimand (GOMOR) on or about December 10, 2019. It stated, in part, \nthat Applicant was \u201chereby reprimanded for being incapacitated for duty. On 23 August \n2019, you consumed alcohol in an excessive amount resulting in you failing to perform \nyour duties as Chief of Inspections during an Inspector General inspection. . . There is no \nexcuse for your irresponsible and improper behavior. . . .\u201d (Item 4, at 66) The GOMOR \nwas placed permanently in his records. (Item 4, at 65) Applicant\u2019s command \nrecommended that he retain his clearance (TS/SCI) and access, and it was not \nsuspended.

The \npsychologist performed a clinical interview of unspecified duration on July 9, 2020; a \nreview of behavioral health records and investigative paperwork, none of which were \nidentified; and used a series of self-report symptom measurement instruments. (Item 3, \nat 1, 3) Based on the records he reviewed, the Forensic Psychologist reported that \nApplicant had been diagnosed with PTSD since 2019, and that he still received treatment; \ndiagnosed with Unspecified Mood Disorder in 2019, and that he still received treatment; \ndiagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder in 2019, and that he still received treatment; \ndiagnosed with Alcohol Dependence in 2019, and that he still received consistent \nintensive treatment; and diagnosed with Alcohol Dependence, in Remission on July 10, \n2020, and has been successfully maintaining his sobriety. Also mentioned was that \u201ca \nprovider note from 10 July 2020, which indicated that [Applicant] reported increased \nsuicidal ideations. He has had relatively recent suicidal ideations with plans to complete \nsuicide.\u201d The Forensic Psychologist also stated that during his interview, Applicant \nreported that he \u201ccontinues to have suicidal ideation and there is no evidence of strong \nmitigators of suicidal risk\u201d (Item 3, at 2) The provider note and the basis for the note were \nnot included in the casefile, and the Forensic Psychologist\u2019s interpretation of Applicant\u2019s \nactual comments was also missing from the casefile. \nThe self-report inventories that Applicant completed for the Forensic Psychologist \nwere to measure suicidal thinking, anxiety, depression, and PTSD. Applicant completed \nBasis 24 \u2013 a leading behavioral health assessment tool designed to assess the outcome \nof mental health or substance abuse treatment from a client\u2019s perspective \u2013 and scored \n1.94; a Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ 2) to assess the frequency of depressed mood \nover the past two weeks \u2013 and scored 21; a General Anxiety Disorder (GAD 7) \nassessment \u2013 and scored 11; the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS) \u2013 \nand scored 3; the Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist for the Diagnostic and \nStatistical Manual of Mental Disorders (5th  Edition) (DSM-5) (PCL5) \u2013 and scored 54; and \nthe Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) \u2013 and scored 0. While there was \nno individual explanation for any of those scores, the Forensic Psychologist opined that \nthe registered results suggested that Applicant is classified as high acute risk for self-\nharm. (Item 3, at 3-4) \nThe forensic diagnoses under DSM-5 were Posttraumatic Stress Disorder; Major \nDepressive Disorder; and Alcohol Dependence, in Remission. The Forensic \nPsychologist\u2019s diagnostic impression and conclusions were, in part, as follows: \n[Applicant] reported that he is maintaining sobriety from alcohol use and his \ntreatment records support that assertion. [He] currently experiences \npsychiatric disorders that impair his ability to remain in the military. Most \nnotably, [he] experiences recent and severe symptoms such as suicidal \nideation. [He has not been able to control his psychiatric symptoms despite \nongoing treatment. His symptoms remain labile and vulnerable to increases \nin severity. People with severe symptoms of depression and suicidal \nideation may exhibit poor judgment and are disposed to mood states that \n5 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nimpair their ability to function in occupational settings such as the military. \nAt this time, [he] does not demonstrate intact reliability, stability, and \njudgment. \n(Item 3, at 4) \nIn response to the SOR, Applicant noted that he has undergone thorough and \nlengthy treatment for his index traumas, and his symptoms of PTSD have subsided. He \nis still seeking care and treatment for depression, and he has made significant progress. \n(Item 1, at 3) \nDespite a plethora of references to medical records and clinical notes, as well as \ndiagnoses and treatment for a variety of issues over the years, and indications that both \nthe IO and the Forensic Psychiatrist had access to them, none of those materials were\nincluded in the casefile. It also remains unclear if any of the healthcare providers treating \nApplicant ever actually performed a mental health evaluation as described in DOD \nInstruction (DODI) 6490.4, Requirements for Mental Health Evaluations of Members of\nthe Armed Forces (August 28, 1997); DOD Instruction 6490.1, Mental Health Evaluations\nof Members of the Armed Forces (October 1, 1997); or The American Psychiatric \nAssociation (APA) Practice Guideline for the Psychiatric Evaluation of Adults, 2nd  Edition\n(June 2006). The security clearance evaluation requested by the DOD CAF and \nperformed by the Forensic Psychologist does not necessarily constitute a Mental Health\nEvaluation under the above-cited sources.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d (Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988)) As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information. The President has \nauthorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant an applicant eligibility for \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to do so.\u201d (Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.) \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the guidelines in SEAD 4. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the guidelines list potentially disqualifying \nconditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility \nfor access to classified information. \nAn administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules \nof law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \n6 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ndecision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known \nas the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a meaningful decision. \nIn the decision-making process, facts must be established by \u201csubstantial \nevidence.\u201d \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might \naccept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all contrary evidence in the record.\u201d  \n(ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1)).  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  (See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th  Cir. 1994).) \nThe Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish a \npotentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of establishing \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced substantial \nevidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant has the \nburden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, extenuation or \nmitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government\u2019s case. The \nburden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. (See ISCR \nCase No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).) \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well. It is \nbecause of this special relationship that the Government must be able to repose a high \ndegree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to classified \ninformation. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. Such \ndecisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather \nthan actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Furthermore, \u201csecurity clearance \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d (Egan, 484 U.S. at 531) \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense \nbe a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d (See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 \n7) Thus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this \ndecision, in whole or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant\u2019s \nallegiance, loyalty, or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has or has not \nmet the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for \nissuing a clearance.  In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that \nare reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I \nhave avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \nAnalysis \nGuideline I, Psychological Conditions \n7 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Psychological Conditions is set \nout in AG \u00b6 27: \nCertain emotional, mental, and personality conditions can impair judgment, \nreliability, or trustworthiness. A formal diagnosis of a disorder is not required \nfor there to be a concern under this guideline. A duly qualified mental health \nprofessional (e.g., clinical psychologist or psychiatrist) employed by, or \nacceptable to and approved by the U.S. Government, should be consulted \nwhen evaluating potentially disqualifying and mitigating information under \nthis guideline and an opinion, including prognosis, should be sought. No \nnegative inference concerning the standards in this guideline may be raised \nsolely on the basis of mental health counseling. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 28: \n(a) behavior that casts doubt on an individual's judgment, stability, reliability, \nor trustworthiness, not covered under any other guideline and that may \nindicate an emotional, mental, or personality condition, including, but not \nlimited to, irresponsible, violent, self-harm, suicidal, paranoid, manipulative, \nimpulsive, chronic lying, deceitful, exploitative, or bizarre behaviors;  \n(b) an opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional that the \nindividual has a condition that may impair judgment, stability, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness;  \n(c) voluntary or involuntary inpatient hospitalization; and \n(d) failure to follow a prescribed treatment plan related to a diagnosed \npsychological/psychiatric condition that may impair judgment, stability, \nreliability, or trustworthiness, including, but not limited to, failure to take \nprescribed medication or failure to attend required counseling sessions. \nIn 2006, Applicant\u2019s wife and her boyfriend made allegations to the police and the \nCommand that Applicant had threatened to kill them and Applicant\u2019s daughter, as well as \nkill himself. No-contact orders were issued to Applicant by the Command; he was directed \nto undergo a mental health evaluation; it was determined that Applicant was at significant \nrisk of potential suicidal and/or homicidal action; it was later determined that he was a \nmoderate risk to self and/or others; he was reported to be in violation of the no-contact \norders; he was disciplined and reduced in grade; and he was diagnosed as a perpetrator \nof spouse abuse, as well as a narcissistic personality disorder. In 2012, Applicant\u2019s ex-\nwife accused him of sexually abusing their daughter. \nIn 2017, at the direction of the DOD CAF, Applicant was evaluated by a licensed \nclinical psychologist. She determined that Applicant has a documented history of \nnarcissistic personality disorder, but also shows some of the atypical thinking such as \nunusual beliefs, and paranoia, odd speech, and social skill deficits such as a lack of close \n8 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nfriends, and social awkwardness commonly seen in an individual with schizotypal \npersonality disorder. She added: \nthe diagnosis in this case would render the patient in need of consistent \ntreatment (until symptoms remit, which is uncommon with diagnosis of this \nnature), but this has clearly not occurred at this point. My prognosis is poor, \ngiven the ingrained nature of his issues and poor likelihood for treatment \ncompliance. His psychological symptoms could certainly impede his \njudgment. . . Based upon his legal history, volatile mood and behaviors, and \nhis history of interpersonal conflicts, it appears that [Applicant] is likely to \nhave impaired reliability. \nBased solely on the facts briefly referred to above, AG \u00b6\u00b6 28(a), 28(b), and 28(c) \nhave been established. AG \u00b6 28(d) has not been established because, while there may \nbe evidence of a diagnosed psychological/psychiatric condition that may impair judgment, \nstability, reliability, or trustworthiness, there is little, if any, evidence to reflect any failure \nto follow a prescribed treatment plan related to the diagnosed condition(s) other than \nApplicant\u2019s decision not to attend some recommended family counseling sessions over a \ndecade ago. \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from psychological conditions under AG \u00b6 29: \n(a) the identified condition is readily controllable with treatment, and the \nindividual has demonstrated ongoing and consistent compliance with the \ntreatment plan; \n(b) the individual has voluntarily entered a counseling or treatment program \nfor a condition that is amenable to treatment, and the individual is currently \nreceiving counseling or treatment with a favorable prognosis by a duly \nqualified mental health professional; \n(c) recent opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional employed \nby, or acceptable to and approved by, the U.S. Government that an \nindividual's previous condition is under control or in remission, and has a \nlow probability of recurrence or exacerbation; \n(d) the past psychological/psychiatric condition was temporary, the situation \nhas been resolved, and the individual no longer shows indications of \nemotional instability; and \n(e) there is no indication of a current problem. \nThe complete record reflects that before Applicant and his first wife went through \nmarital discord, and for a period thereafter, he had a stellar military record; he was highly \nthought of by his Command and his units; his superiors and coworkers praised his duty \nperformance, military bearing, professionalism, community-service activities; he received \nrecognition for his performance; and he had an excellent reputation for honesty, integrity, \n9 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nand trustworthiness. Character references saw no evidence of any suicidal or homicidal \nideations, and never saw Applicant lose his temper or act irrationally. Applicant\u2019s \nreputation and background were summarily cast aside when allegations of misconduct \narose. \nDivorce and child custody disputes have been routinely known to become ugly and \nhostile, and the situation reported in this instance is not shocking or unusual, for it merely \nsuggests a planned road map to success by one litigant against the other. One shocking \nor unusual feature in this case is the robotic manner in which there does not seem to be \nany analysis or investigation by the police or Command authorities to determine the truth \nof the allegations, explore the possible motivations for the allegations, or consider \nApplicant\u2019s repeated denials regarding those allegations, especially when he had a \nsterling reputation for honesty, integrity, and trustworthiness. No one in authority ever \nexamined Applicant\u2019s ex-wife\u2019s allegations of an assault by an instructor while on a \nbusiness trip; the alleged incident in the kitchen when she claimed she was cornered by \na tenant; or her allegations of assault on their daughter in 2012. Perhaps they could have \nconnected the dots between those allegations and the ones against Applicant. \nAs noted above, the only documented evidence of one of those allegations \nappears in the Military Protective Order which cites as the sole basis for the issuance of \nthe order that Applicant\u2019s wife \u201cis concerned for her safety and [Applicant has] shown \nbehavior that could be interpreted as threatening.\u201d The exact statement was not recorded; \nthere is no evidence that it was under oath; there is no evidence of an investigation into \nthe truth of the allegations; it is unclear what the specific concerns of the wife were; and \nit is also unclear who made the interpretation that what was reportedly said was \nthreatening. Despite unit reservations regarding the allegations, and Applicant\u2019s repeated \ndenials, the initial steps to destroying Applicant\u2019s military career had begun. The local \nBaker Act \u2013 something now commonly referred to as the Red Flag Law \u2013 was applied, \nwithout due process, forcing Applicant to turn in his weapons, based solely on his wife\u2019s \nallegations; he was disciplined and reduced in grade for reportedly violating the no-\ncontact orders, based on additional allegations by his wife; he was ordered to undergo a \ncommand directed mental health evaluation; and he was required to attend Family \nAdvocacy Program and LSSC sessions. \nFar more disturbing than the robotic manner in which certain actions were taken \nby the police and Command authorities, were the somewhat superficial and unexplained \nactions taken by the mental health providers within the military system, most of which \ncannot be considered mental health evaluations under DODI 6490.1, or DODI 6490.4. \nApplicant initially went through a number of interview sessions, generally consisting of \nbetween 35 and 50 minutes each, after which he was prescribed medications for \ndepression, anxiety, panic disorder, and insomnia. \nOn November 29, 2006, and December 1, 2006, after being seen for merely 45 \nminutes, with no evidence of any psychological testing administered to Applicant, it was \ndetermined that he was \u201cat significant risk of potential suicidal and/or homicidal action.\u201d \nApplicant\u2019s denials were disregarded because of \u201cincongruent corroborating information,\u201d \nnot otherwise identified or described.

It is interesting that, despite significant \nrisk of potential suicidal and/or homicidal action, Applicant was not involuntarily \nhospitalized. Perhaps it was because those conditions were not as reported. \nOn February 26, 2007, again without being administered any psychological tests, \nbased on the \u201capparent discrepancy in reports and history,\u201d not otherwise identified or \ndescribed, he was found to be at moderate risk to self and/or others, and given a \ndiagnosis of physical abuse of adult. There is no documented basis for this diagnosis, \nand the factual sources leading to it are unknown. On March 23, 2007, the family \nadvocacy officer boot-strapped the earlier information to the file and altered the V61.12 \ndiagnosis to perpetrator of spouse abuse, without any explanation, and added an entirely \nnew diagnosis of narcissistic personality disorder, claiming it meets criteria 1 (grandiose \nsense of self-importance), 2 (preoccupied with fantasies), 5 (sense of entitlement), 7 \n(lacks empathy), and 9 (shows arrogant, haughty behaviors or attitudes). The bases for \nthose findings were not described, and they appear to be at odds with descriptions of \nApplicant by his superiors and coworkers \u2013 information that no healthcare provider or \nCommand leadership ever sought to provide. Despite the comments made, Applicant was \nnot deemed to be suicidal or homicidal, and the risk remained moderate. He was \nscheduled to return in two weeks for a risk assessment. \nThere is a Mental Health Record made by the licensed clinical psychologist that \nthe record was being closed without Applicant again being seen. That record contains the \nfollowing statement: \u201cthe impact of the treatment of military was administratively \ndischarged from active duty service based on the results of the [Command Directed \nEvaluation] and diagnosis of personality disorder.\u201d That characterization is patently false, \nand without any basis in fact, and the source of the comment is not known. Nevertheless, \nit was subsequently included in a subsequent DOD CAF-directed mental health \nevaluation over a decade later, as well as an allegation in the SOR. \nAs noted above, in 2017, at the direction of the DOD CAF, Applicant was evaluated \nby a licensed clinical psychologist. It is not known whether she used the DSM-IV-TR or \nthe DSM-5 in making her evaluation. She determined that Applicant has a documented \nhistory of narcissistic personality disorder, but also shows some of the atypical thinking \nsuch as unusual beliefs, and paranoia, odd speech, and social skill deficits such as a lack \nof close friends, and social awkwardness commonly seen in an individual with schizotypal \npersonality disorder. She failed to describe the basis for her conclusions of atypical \nthinking, unusual beliefs, paranoia, odd speech, social skills deficits, lack of close friends, \nand social awkwardness, especially in light of his many supporters and friends. In the \nabsence of such information, her conclusions are considered baseless. Far more \ntroubling is her reliance on the \u201chistorical\u201d information \u2013 Applicant\u2019s negative legal history, \nvolatile mood and behaviors, and his history of interpersonal conflicts \u2013 furnished to her \nby the DOD CAF without further investigation. \nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption \n11 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Alcohol Consumption is set out \nin AG \u00b6 21: \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about \nan individual's reliability and trustworthiness. \nThe guideline notes a condition that could raise security concerns for Alcohol \nConsumption in AG \u00b6 22: \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under \nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other \nincidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the individual's alcohol \nuse or whether the individual has been diagnosed with alcohol use disorder.  \nApplicant acknowledged that from 2005 until mid-2016, she was arrested at least \nfive times, as alleged in the SOR, and charged with a variety of alcohol-related violations, \nincluding DUI, DUAC, and open container, all of which resulted in convictions. AG \u00b6 25(a) \nhas been established. \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions under AG \u00b6 23 that could \nmitigate security concerns arising from Alcohol Consumption: \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or \njudgment; and \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive alcohol \nuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and has \ndemonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or \nabstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations. \nNeither of the mitigating conditions apply. Applicant has never acknowledged that \nshe has consumed alcohol to excess; she has repeatedly denied being intoxicated or \nimpaired in connection with any of her arrests and convictions; she never fully explained \nor acknowledged some of her alcohol-related arrests, claiming instead that she could not \nrecall the incidents; and she contends, without testimonial or documentary support that \nshe has been abstinent since the July 2016 arrest. She chose not to submit any \ninformation regarding her arrests, drinking habits, or claimed abstinence in response to \nthe FORM, relying solely on the police records, court records, her SF 86 entries, and the \nnotes from her OPM interview. She failed to address inconsistencies in the evidence, and \nfailed to demonstrate a clear and established pattern of abstinence. \nWhole-Person Concept \n12 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Moreover, I have \nevaluated the various aspects of this case in light of the totality of the record evidence \nand have not merely performed a piecemeal analysis. (See U.S. v. Bottone, 365 F.2d \n389, 392 (2d Cir. 1966); See also ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Jun. 2, 2006)) \nThere is some evidence mitigating Applicant\u2019s conduct. Applicant is a 35-year-old \nprospective employee of a defense contractor. She has reported being an ADPE \ntechnician with her prospective employer since some time after July 2017. In her previous \nemployment, she served as an MWR technician at a location in Afghanistan from \nNovember 2016 for about one year. She is a high school graduate with some college \ncredits, but no degree. \nThe disqualifying evidence under the whole-person concept is simply more \nsubstantial. Applicant is not a reliable historian regarding her history of alcohol \ninvolvement because of her inconsistent statements in which she either denied, \nconcealed, omitted, or could not recall significant portions of her alcohol consumption and \npersonal conduct histories. According to Applicant, her alcohol consumption was not \nsignificant because she never drank to excess and limited her drinking to one or two \nalcohol drinks at dinner on an infrequent basis, during holidays, or on special occasions. \nThe facts do not support her description of her alcohol use. Despite her arrests for such \nthings as DUI; DUAC; driving without a license; use of another\u2019s/altered license; open \ncontainer of beer or wine in a motor vehicle; driving under suspension; and driving on \nwrong side of road, she continued to minimize her alcohol use and argued that the DUIs \nand DUAC were the result of her repeated refusal to submit to breathalyzer tests. The \nvarious courts hearing the cases against her essentially found sufficient evidence to \nconvict her of most of the charges, or reduced charges like reckless driving, and only \nacquitted her of one charge, driving on wrong side of road. In addition, Applicant did not \noffer any evidence to support her contention that she has abstained since mid-2016. \nOverall, the evidence leaves me with substantial questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all of these reasons, I \n13 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nconclude Applicant has failed to mitigate the security concerns arising from her alcohol \nconsumption and personal conduct.

From 2012 to 2021, he was employed by a different federal contractor. He has held \na security clearance at various times during the past 22 years and uninterrupted for the \npast ten years. (Transcript (Tr.) 27-30, GE 1) \nApplicant acknowledged that he is a recovering alcoholic. He began consuming \nalcohol around age 14 and continued to January 2019. (SOR \u00b6 2.a) He has never had \nany alcohol-related incidents away from work or at work. He has never been arrested or \ncharged with an alcohol-related offense. He has never been disciplined for anything \nalcohol-related. In the past, he had issues with his ability to sleep and that caused him to \nbe late for work on occasion. He testified these were not alcohol-related. (Tr. 30-35) \nApplicant acknowledged that in 2012 he was using alcohol excessively. In 2013, \non his own accord, he admitted himself to a 5-day inpatient detoxification program (SOR \n\u00b6 1.a). He explained that at that time, he loosely had a plan that he would abstain from \ndrinking for a while, but he did not plan to stop drinking alcohol forever. When he was \ndischarged from inpatient treatment, he was diagnosed with anxiety and not otherwise \nspecified alcohol dependence. For the next two and half years, he did not consume \nalcohol. He then began drinking and gradually increased his consumption. (Tr. 32-33, 42-\n45, 76-78; GE 3) \nIn 2017, Applicant realized he was drinking too much and again admitted himself \nto a 5-day inpatient detoxification program to get help. He was diagnosed with anxiety \ndisorder, mood disorder, and alcohol dependence (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.c). He acknowledged \nhis consumption level was not normal and was harmful. He was referred to a therapist \nand a psychiatrist, who prescribed medication to help with anxiety associated with alcohol \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nwithdrawal. He was told to abstain from alcohol consumption. He was told to take the \nmedication as needed. Lethargy was a side effect of one of the medications. He credibly \ntestified that he told his psychiatrist that his anxiety was better, and she agreed he could \ncease taking the medication. He credibly testified that he has always followed his doctors\u2019 \norders regarding taking prescribed medications. He did not stop taking the medication \ncontrary to medical advice. He was taking medication to relieve the anxiety associated \nwith withdrawal symptoms and believed he was to take the drugs \u201cas needed.\u201d He \ndisputes he was noncompliant. He saw the psychiatrist for two visits and the therapist \ntwice a month for six months. He testified that the medication he was prescribed was to \ntemporarily treat his acute anxiety. When the anxiety ceased, he no longer took the \nmedication. I found Applicant\u2019s testimony credible. (Tr. 45-49, 78-85, 105-108; GE 4) \nApplicant abstained from consuming alcohol for about six months until 2018 when \nhe resumed. Then he felt he was consuming too much alcohol and it was not normal. He \nagain referred himself for treatment as an inpatient in a detoxification program for five \ndays. (SOR \u00b6 1.d) He had two visits with a psychiatrist and he did not recall if he saw a \ntherapist. After completing the program in the latter part of 2018, he began attending \nAlcoholics Anonymous (AA). (Tr. 49-51, 85-90; GE 5) \nApplicant acknowledged that he has been repeatedly told to abstain from alcohol \nconsumption. He testified that his family and friends recommended he attend AA. He \ncredibly testified that AA was more helpful than therapy, which was general and focused \non trying to find an event that triggered his alcohol consumption. He was open to talking \nwith a therapist, but it was the different approach that AA offered that made a difference. \nBeing with a group of people with similar issues who could relate and understand his \nchallenges was instrumental to his commitment to sobriety. They offered him different \napproaches to staying sober. He stated that after attending AA, he started to see a \ndifferent aspect to his alcohol consumption. (Tr. 51-54, 103) \nApplicant acknowledged that when he began participating in AA, he was ready to \nmake a lifelong commitment to abstaining from alcohol consumption. His attitude shifted. \nBefore, his commitment was to be sober for a period-of-time, but not forever. Since he \nbegan attending AA, his commitment is for life. He testified that his date of sobriety is \nJanuary 25, 2019. He credibly testified that he has not consumed any alcohol since then. \nHe provided photos of his sobriety chips, which included his three-year chip and other \nmilestone chips. (Tr. 51-55, 59-60; AE D) \nApplicant attends AA meetings weekly. He has a sponsor with whom he meets \nregularly and who guides him through the 12-step program and the \u201cBig Book,\u201d which is \nthe handbook for AA. His sponsor has moved and no longer attends the same meeting, \nbut is geographically close so Applicant and he meet outside of the AA meetings and \ndiscuss how to proceed with his sobriety. Applicant provided copies of the attendance \nlogs for his meetings since September 2020. He testified he attended weekly meetings \nbefore then. Applicant has also taken on a leadership role in the meetings by being the \nchairperson. He testified that the last three steps of the 12-step program are ones that \nare worked on in perpetuity.

He also will mentor new participants to the group. (Tr.53-62; AE C) \nApplicant testified that he no longer suffers from anxiety. His previous anxiety was \nassociated with his alcohol withdrawal. He does not take medication for anxiety and no \none has suggested he seek treatment for any disorder. He has adopted a healthy lifestyle \nby going to the gym five days a week. He provided a copy of the attendance log from his \ngym. (Tr. 40-41, 62-65 100-101; AE F) \nApplicant acknowledged that in the past he was embarrassed about his alcohol \nuse. Now he does not have difficulty talking about it. Part of AA is to accept his condition \nand freely discuss his experience and abuse of alcohol. (Tr. 65-66, 102-103) \nIn January 2021 Applicant was evaluated by a licensed clinical psychologist and \nboard certified neuropsychologist (LP), requested and approved by the government. She \nadministered psychological tests. She diagnosed him with alcohol abuse disorder, severe \nin current remission and unspecified anxiety disorder. She opined that Applicant\u2019s \njudgment, reliability, and trustworthiness could be compromised based on his conditions. \nShe noted that Applicant lacked candor during his interview, which suggested \nguardedness and possibly poor insight into his conditions. She opined that his \npsychological profile suggested that he was not open to treatment, which increased the \nlikelihood of relapse. Therefore, her prognosis was guarded. (SOR \u00b6 1.e). (GE 2) \nApplicant provided context about his interview with LP. He explained that LP took \nissue with the amount and frequency of his alcohol use. He explained to her it was difficult \nto explain how much alcohol he consumed at different times because the amount and \nfrequency varied and it was difficult to quantify. He believed he was open and honest with \nher. He believed that she thought he was being inconsistent because of his answer. He \nalso believed that he no longer suffered from an anxiety disorder, which was associated \nwith his alcohol abuse. (Tr. 66-67) \nApplicant was evaluated by Dr. W who has a Ph.D. in psychology and has \npracticed in the field since 1976 and as a forensic and clinical psychologist since 1993. \nHe is a Fellow of the American Psychological Association. He is licensed in several \njurisdictions and has been qualified as an expert witness in different disciplines. He has \nan extensive curriculum vitae, which includes numerous articles he authored for \nprofessional publications and presentations. He is an expert in his field. (Tr. 111; AE H) \nDr. W. evaluated Applicant in November 2021 with the understanding that his \nevaluation would be objective. He noted LP\u2019s diagnosis was that Applicant was at risk of \nrelapse for his prior alcohol use disorder, especially because he suffers from anxiety, \nwhich LP believed could lead to alcohol relapse. Dr. W. diagnosed Applicant with Alcohol \nUse Disorder, severe, in sustained remission. His prognosis was good.

Applicant \nexplained that alcohol was something he formerly used to help with insomnia, but he has \nmaintained a consistent sleep schedule for the past three years, which has eliminated his \ninsomnia and need for alcohol. Dr. W conducted psychological tests, which were \nsignificant in that they indicated that Applicant made no effort to minimize his mental or \nemotional problems and that he completed the test honestly and accurately, which is an \nindication of overall honesty on the part of Applicant. (AE G) \nDr. W reviewed the known and reported history, psychological testing, clinical \ninterview and mental status examination of Applicant. He determined that Applicant had \na history of alcohol abuse and dependence and that he had to undergo detoxification \nthree times. Dr. W noted that \u201cIn Sustained Remission,\u201d indicates that the individual has \nnot met the criteria for Alcohol Use Disorder in at least 12 months. In Applicant\u2019s case, he \nreported that he has abstained for over three years. Dr. W noted: \nAbstinence is not required for an individual to be considered In Sustained \nRemission. All that is required is for the individual not to have met the criteria \nfor the Alcohol Use Disorder Diagnosis during a 12-month period. However, \nfor members of [AA] to be considered sober and compliant with the program \nof AA, they are required to be continually abstinent. (AE G) \nDr. W noted inconsistencies in LP\u2019s report. LP first determined that Applicant did \nnot suffer from a mood disorder, but then stated that he had \u201cminimal effective treatment \nfor Alcohol Use Disorder nor his mood disorder.\u201d (GE 2 at page 5). LP\u2019s report references \nno mood disorder other than Bipolar Disorder, which LP indicated Applicant did not suffer \nfrom. Dr. W noted that LP concurrently stated that Applicant does and does not suffer \nfrom a mood disorder. Dr. W agreed with LP\u2019s conclusion that there was no evidence of \nBipolar Disorder and he did not see any evidence of any other mood disorder. (Tr. 112-\n115, 121-122; AE G) \nDr. W noted that LP asserted that Applicant had minimal effective treatment for his \nalcohol use disorder. Dr. W emphatically disagreed with this, as Applicant has participated \nin AA, which in his opinion is the \u201cmost effective and widespread treatment for [Alcohol \nUse Disorder] in existence.\u201d (Tr. 112-115; AE G) \nDr. W noted that LP opined that Applicant was not fully candid in his interview. Dr. \nW found the opposite and noted that Applicant revealed information that was not flattering \nand went far beyond the questions posed to him. He noted that LP\u2019s administration of a \npsychological test was valid and indicated that Applicant was honest, which implies that \nhe was inclined to be honest throughout his assessment with LP. (Tr. 115-118; AE G) \nDr. W\u2019s conclusions are that Applicant has suffered from alcohol problems during \nhis adult life. He chose to discontinue alcohol use twice without obtaining the necessary \nfollow-up intervention for his addictive behavior. On this third attempt, he followed up with \nthe medical detoxification program with an acceptance of the AA program. Applicant has \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nfully accepted the full scope of the AA program. He does more than just document his \nattendance. He has a sponsor, has completed the 12-step program, and has volunteered \nhis service for the program. This indicates Applicant accepts his need for sobriety and is \nnot merely going through the motions to placate an outside authority. (Tr. 112-117; AE G) \nDr. W noted that Applicant\u2019s alcohol problem is familiar in that many individuals \nwith alcohol problems repeatedly deny the seriousness and repeatedly tell themselves \nthey can manage the problem on their own without a treatment program. Applicant \nbelieved this on two occasions following his medical detoxification. He ultimately arrived \nat the conclusion that he needed help to stay sober, and he could not resolve the problem \non his own using will power alone. Dr. W noted that in AA, the final realization that an \nindividual has an alcohol problem and needs outside help occurs when the individual hits \n\u201crock bottom.\u201d In Applicant\u2019s case, hitting rock bottom took the form of his realization that \nhe was powerless over alcohol and that every medical detoxification was just going to \nlead to another medical detoxification unless he got help for his addiction. Dr. W stated: \nIt should be noted that [Applicant] has attained his current stability through \nhis participation in AA. Every professional alcohol treatment program, \nwhether residential or outpatient, always concludes treatment with a referral \nof patients to AA for long term, continuous follow up. Although [Applicant] \ndid not participate in a residential alcohol treatment program, his final step \ntowards recovery by attending and participating in the program of AA fits \nthe pattern of those who successfully recover from alcohol use disorders. \n(AE G) \nDr. W concluded in his report the following: \n[Applicant] is approaching three years of sobriety and participation in the \nprogram of AA. To a great degree of psychological certainty, I consider \n[Applicant] to be fit to continue to hold a security clearance and to be free \nfrom his former alcohol problem. (AE G) \nDr. W testified at Applicant\u2019s hearing and reiterated his prognosis and conclusions. \nHe stated that Applicant\u2019s full participation in AA is the strongest predictor of whether he \nwill relapse. He noted that LP stated that Applicant lacked insight into the severity of his \ncondition. Dr. W disagreed stating, if that were the case, Applicant would not be attending \nAA, have a sponsor, or continue to work the 12-step program. LP found that Applicant \nhad an unspecified anxiety disorder. Dr. W found that Applicant did not have an anxiety \ndisorder; rather his past reflected that when he had anxiety he turned to alcohol. Anxiety \nis a contributing factor with anyone who abuses alcohol. People find alcohol diminishes \nthe anxiety. Applicant\u2019s participation in AA helps him handle anxiety and gives him an \nalternative approach. (Tr. 112-113, 121-128) \nApplicant took two PETH tests to detect for alcohol consumption. Dr. W testified \nthat PETH is a test that is required by many professional organizations in order for a \nmember to regain a professional license after having an alcohol-related incident.

(Tr. 62-63; \n118-121; AE E) \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant falsified material facts on his December 2017 \nsecurity clearance application (SCA). Section 24 asked if he sought counseling or \ntreatment as a result of his alcohol use. He answered \u201cyes\u201d and disclosed his 2017 \ninpatient treatment, but did not disclose he was admitted to the hospital in 2013 for \ncomplaints of anxiety and heavy drinking. (GE 1) \nApplicant testified that he approached his 2013 detoxification as merely taking a \nbreak from using alcohol. He explained that he rushed through the SCA and focused on \nhis 2017 treatment. He said that he did not deliberately attempt to deceive the \ngovernment. Applicant said that in hindsight and now as a recovering alcohol, he would \nconsider his 2013 treatment as a significant event, but when he completed his 2017 SCA, \nhe did not focus on that event. He realized his error when it was brought to his attention \nby the government investigator during a background interview in 2018. Applicant admitted \nthat his past alcohol abuse embarrassed him. Now that he has been an active member \nin AA, he is no longer feels inhibited about discussing his past issues with alcohol. (Tr. \n67-75, 90-98) \nApplicant\u2019s AA sponsor (TH) provided a letter on his behalf. He met Applicant \nalmost four years ago when Applicant began attending weekly AA meetings. It became \nclear to TH that Applicant was serious about his sobriety and learning the AA program. \nTH offered to guide him through the steps and work the program with him. TH stated that \nApplicant was willing to do the work. They worked together after weekly meetings and \nweekend mornings. They completed the action steps of the program, and Applicant \ncontinues to work the steps that require ongoing efforts (Step 10 through 12). He and \nApplicant communicate regularly. TH stated: \u201cDue to [Applicant\u2019s] step work, consistent \nmeeting attendance, willingness, and honesty, I believe [Applicant] is recovered as \ndefined by the Big Book.\u201d (AE I) \nApplicant provided a character letter from JA. They have been friends for 35 years. \nApplicant and JA were college roommates, and Applicant was in his wedding. JA is aware \nof Applicant\u2019s past struggles with alcohol and the SOR allegations. JA lived with Applicant \nfrom December 2020 to March 2021. He stated that Applicant did not consume any \nalcohol when they lived together. He described Applicant as a caring, giving, and honest \nperson. Applicant sticks to his schedule and leads a healthy lifestyle.

In addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, \nthe adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating \nconditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline G: Alcohol Consumption \nAG \u00b6 21 expresses the security concerns for alcohol consumption: \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about \nan individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness.  \nAG \u00b6 22 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. I find the following to be potentially applicable: \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving under the \ninfluence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other \nincidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the individual\u2019s alcohol \nuse or whether the individual has been diagnosed with alcohol use disorder;  \n(b) alcohol-related incidents at work, such as reporting for work or duty in \nan intoxicated or impaired condition, drinking on the job, or jeopardizing the \nwelfare and safety of others, regardless of whether the individual is \ndiagnosed with alcohol use disorder;  \n(c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired \njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed with alcohol \nuse disorder;  \n(d) diagnosis by a duly qualified medical or mental health professional (e.g. \nphysician, clinical psychologist, psychiatrist, or licensed clinical social \nworker) of alcohol use disorder; \n(e) the failure to follow treatment advice once diagnosed; and  \n(f) alcohol consumption, which is not in accordance with treatment \nrecommendations, after a diagnosis of alcohol use disorder. \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThere is no evidence that Applicant had any alcohol-related incidents either at work \nor away from work. AG \u00b6\u00b6 22(a) and 22(b) do not apply. There is evidence that Applicant \nconsumed alcohol excessively and referred himself for treatment on three occasions. He \nwas diagnosed during treatment and by a government-approved psychologist with alcohol \ndependence and Alcohol Use Disorder. There is evidence that he did not follow his \ntreatment plans and relapsed. AG \u00b6\u00b6 22(c), 22(d), 22(e), and 22(f) apply. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom alcohol consumption. I have considered the following mitigating conditions under AG \n\u00b6 23: \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or \njudgment;  \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive alcohol \nuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and has \ndemonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or \nabstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations;  \n(c) the individual is participating in counseling or a treatment program, has \nno previous history of treatment or relapse, and is making satisfactory \nprogress in a treatment program; and  \n(d) the individual has successfully completed a treatment program along \nwith any required aftercare, and has demonstrated a clear and established \npattern of modified consumption or abstinence in accordance with treatment \nrecommendations.  \nApplicant has been sober and following the 12-step program of AA since January \n2019, more than three and a half years. As noted by Dr. W, it is not unusual for those \nsuffering from Alcohol Use Disorder to stumble before coming to the conclusion that they \nare powerless over their condition and need outside help. Applicant failed to remain sober \nafter treatment on two occasions. After his third detoxification program, he began \nattending AA. This was his turning point. Applicant\u2019s commitment to sobriety is evident by \nhis abstinence and his continued participation in working the AA program beyond just \nshowing up for meetings. He has offered to be a sponsor, sets up and chairs meetings, \nand continues to meet his sponsor. He readily acknowledges his alcohol history and has \nprovided an abundance of evidence to overcome his problem. AA is a recognized and \nrespected program to help those with alcohol issues. Applicant has successfully \nparticipated in the program for close to four years. All of the above mitigating conditions \napply. \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nGuideline I: Psychological Conditions \nThe security concern for psychological conditions is set out in AG \u00b6 27: \nCertain emotional, mental, and personality conditions can impair judgment, \nreliability, or trustworthiness. A formal diagnosis of a disorder is not required \nfor there to be a concern under this guideline. A duly qualified mental health \nprofessional (e.g., clinical psychologist, or psychiatrist) employed by, or \nacceptable to and approved by the U.S. Government, should be consulted \nwhen evaluating potentially disqualifying and mitigating information under \nthis guideline and an opinion, including prognosis, should be sought. No \nnegative interference concerning the standards in this guideline may be \nraised solely on the basis of mental health counseling. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. I have \nconsidered all of the disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 28, and the following are \npotentially applicable: \n(a) behavior that casts doubt on an individual\u2019s judgment, stability, reliability, \nor trustworthiness, not covered under any other guideline and that may \nindicate an emotional, mental, or personality condition, including, but not \nlimited to, irresponsible, violent, self-harm, suicidal, paranoid, manipulative, \nimpulsive, chronic lying, deceitful, exploitative, or bizarre behaviors; and \n(b) an opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional that the \nindividual has a condition that may impair judgment, stability, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness;  \n(c) voluntary or involuntary inpatient hospitalization; and  \n(d) failure to follow prescribed treatment plans related to a diagnosed \npsychological/psychiatric condition that may impair judgment, stability, \nreliability, or trustworthiness, including but not limited to, failure to take \nprescribed medication, or failure to attend required counseling sessions. \nThere is insufficient evidence that Applicant exhibited behavior as described in AG \n\u00b6 28(a). Applicant admitted himself three times for inpatient treatment for his alcohol \nissues. There is evidence that during his inpatient treatments, medical professionals \ndiagnosed him with alcohol dependence, anxiety disorder, and mood disorder in 2017, \nand in 2018, he was diagnosed with alcohol dependence and withdrawal. The evidence \nsupports that Applicant did not follow prescribed treatment plans as he continued to \nconsume alcohol. I did not find sufficient evidence to conclude he failed to take prescribed \nmedication or failed to attend required counseling sessions. In January 2021, he was \ndiagnosed by LP with Alcohol Use Disorder, severe, in current remission and unspecified \nanxiety disorder. AG \u00b6\u00b6 28(b), 28(c), and 28(d) apply. \n11 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom psychological conditions. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 29 were \nconsidered: \n(a) the identified condition is readily controllable with treatment, and the \nindividual has demonstrated ongoing and consistent compliance with the \ntreatment plan;  \n(b) the individual has voluntarily entered a counseling or treatment program \nfor a condition that is amenable to treatment, and the individual is currently \nreceiving counseling or treatment with a favorable prognosis by a duly \nqualified mental health professional;  \n(c) recent opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional employed \nby, or acceptable to and approved by, the U.S. Government that an \nindividual\u2019s previous condition is under control or in remission, and has a \nlow probability of recurrence or exacerbation; and \n(e) there is no indication of a current problem.  \nApplicant was evaluated by LP in January 2021. He was re-evaluated in November \n2021 by Dr. W. I have considered the timing and depth of both reports. The evidence \nsupports that Applicant\u2019s anxiety issues were related to his alcohol use. My analysis under \nGuideline G, alcohol consumption, also applies under the psychological issues that were \nraised. I found Dr. W\u2019s prognosis based on Applicant\u2019s more than three and half years of \nsobriety and his active participation in AA to be most probative. He opined that Applicant \nwas fit to continue to hold a security clearance and he is free from his former alcohol \nproblem. I find AG \u00b6 29(a) and 29(e) apply. \nDr. W was not a mental health professional approved by the government, so AG \u00b6 \n29(c) does not apply. However, I give great weight to his unbiased and professional \nopinion. \nApplicant voluntarily admitted himself for treatment as an inpatient and then to AA, \nshowing his commitment to resolve his alcohol issues. Despite stumbling, he continued \nuntil he found the right path to sobriety through AA. He has demonstrated an ongoing \ncommitment to sobriety, and he continues to participate in AA. I have considered LP\u2019s \nprognosis, but my concern is with her minimal consideration of his more than three years \nof sobriety and active AA participation. AG \u00b6 29(b) applies. \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern for personal conduct: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \n12 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.  \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. I find the following potentially applicable: \n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information; or concealing or \nomitting information, concerning relevant facts to any employer, \ninvestigator, security official, competent medical or mental health \nprofessional involved in making a recommendation relevant to a national \nsecurity eligibility determination, or other official government representative.  \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant falsified material facts on his December 2017 SCA \nwhen he failed to disclose his 2013 inpatient treatment. Applicant denied his failure to \ndisclose was deliberate. I believe Applicant was aware of his 2013 treatment, was \nembarrassed about it and omitted it. I also believe he was focused on his 2017 treatment \nand was still in his denial stage of his alcoholism and deliberately omitted the 2013 \ntreatment. The above disqualifying condition applies. \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 17 are potentially applicable to the \ndisqualifying security concerns based on the facts: \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to \nrecur. \nApplicant\u2019s failure to disclose his 2013 inpatient treatment was not minor, but I \nbelieve when he completed his SCA in December 2017, he had not yet come to terms \nwith his alcoholism. That has changed. Applicant has candidly testified and bared his \nproblems with alcohol. He has embraced the tenants of AA, and he was open and honest \nduring his hearing. I find that his failure to disclose this information happened under \nunique circumstances and is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on his current \nreliability, trustworthiness and good judgment. The above mitigating conditions apply. \n13 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuidelines G, I, and E, in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) \nwere addressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional comment. \nApplicant is a recovering alcoholic. He recognized his struggles with alcohol and \nrepeatedly attempted to address them. He was unsuccessful until he went through \ndetoxification in 2018 and began attending AA. He did not have alcohol-related offenses \neither at work or outside of work. Being an alcoholic does not prevent someone from \nholding a security clearance. He is a success story in that he is recovering and continues \nto be a productive member of society. His commitment to sobriety is evident Applicant \nhas met his burden of persuasion. The record evidence leaves me without questions and \ndoubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For these \nreasons, I conclude Applicant mitigated the security concerns arising under Guideline G, \nalcohol consumption, Guideline I, psychological conditions, and Guideline E, personal \nconduct. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline I: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.e: \nFor Applicant \n14 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nParagraph 2, Guideline G:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.b: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 3, Guideline E: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 3.a: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national security to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance. \nEligibility for access to classified information is granted. \nCarol G.

After a thorough and careful review of the \npleadings, testimony, and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact. \nApplicant is 56 years old. She married in 1993 and divorced in 2016. She has four \nsons, ages 29, 27, 26 and 23. She is a college graduate who took time off to raise her \nchildren. In 2012, she went back to work full time when her third child started high school. \nShe worked for the same employer until 2017, when she was laid off due to budget cuts. \nShe was unemployed for about six months and then worked for about five months before \nleaving her job to care for her sick mother. She began her present employment with a \nfederal contractor in November 2018. (Tr. 16-25; GE 1) \nThe debts in the SOR are corroborated by Applicant\u2019s admission, credit reports \nprovided as Government Exhibits, and her testimony. (GE 1-7)  \nIn about 2015 one of Applicant\u2019s sons was working for a franchise business that \nhe thought had great potential. He was being mentored by the owner. Applicant and her \nson discussed the possibility of purchasing their own franchise. Her son thought it was a \npromising opportunity to purchase a franchise and open it in a neighboring city. Applicant \ntestified that she did her due diligence by working with local businesses, attending training \nand participating in working groups and discussions with coaches offered by the franchise \nbusiness. (Tr. 25-31) \nIn October 2015, Applicant decided to purchase the franchise and was the sole \nowner. It cost $60,000. She was working full time ($70,000 annual income in 2015; \n$95,000 in 2022) and had received a lump-sum payment of $90,000 from her divorce. \nFrom the Small Business Association (SBA), she obtained a loan ($150,000) to start the \nbusiness (SOR \u00b6 1.a-$133,749). She purchased two vehicles for the business (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.c and 1.d). She used credit cards to finance some of the business expenses. She said \nshe was nervous and excited. Her two oldest sons were full-time employees of the \nbusiness and her two younger sons, who were still in college and high school, \noccasionally worked for the business. (Tr. 31-33, 66-77) \nThe business opened in early 2016 and did very well initially. In 2018, the business \nstarted to fail due to various factors; for instance, she found it was difficult to get good \nemployees, and she believed some employees were stealing from the business. In 2018, \nshe and her sons were working just to pay the franchise fee. She was unable to repay \nher SBA loan and contacted them about her options.

No arrangements to pay the debt were made. \nIn June 2022, she spoke with the SBA about the defaulted loan and was advised to submit \na form showing her assets and liabilities. She has not yet submitted the form. (Tr. 32-38, \n66-77, 89-91) \nApplicant testified that after the business failed, she was working with a lawyer and \ndiscussed filing bankruptcy. She said she was working with the attorney for at least a \nyear. She changed attorneys and discussed filing bankruptcy with her current attorney \nover the course of approximately two years. At the time her business failed, she and her \nex-husband were still joint owners of a house they were attempting to sell, but were having \ndifficulty. Due to the equity in the house it was difficult to file bankruptcy. She estimated \nher Chapter 13 bankruptcy payments would be around $3,500 a month, which she could \nnot afford. She did not have any liquid assets. She said the house sold on July 7, 2022. \nShe said that she was entitled to $275,000 from the proceeds of the sale, but her ex-\nhusband had done significant repairs in order to sell it, and she had to reimburse him for \nthe costs. She did not know exactly the amount owed, but anticipated it could be $40,000 \nto $50,000. She anticipated receiving her share of the profit shortly. (Tr. 35-40) \nThe debt in SOR \u00b6 1.b ($18,732) was a credit card that was used in Applicant\u2019s \nbusiness. She contacted the creditor in 2018. She did not follow up and contact them \nagain until a week before her hearing, with a letter stating she believed there were some \nfraudulent charges made to the account. She requested an itemized bill. The debt is not \nresolved. (Tr. 40-43, 77-78; AE F) \nThe debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c and 1.d ($9,474 and $9,025, respectively) are two \naccounts from the same creditor for vehicles Applicant purchased and were used in her \nbusiness and later repossessed. A week before her hearing, she sent a letter to the \ncreditor indicating she wanted to discuss making an arrangement for payment. The debt \nin SOR \u00b6 1.j ($250) is also with the same creditor. Applicant testified that this account \nwas bundled with the other two accounts, but did not offer any documents to substantiate \nthe information. None of these debts are resolved.

(Tr. 57, 79-83) \nApplicant completed a security clearance application (SCA) in February 2020. In \nresponse to questions about whether Applicant had any delinquencies involving \nenforcement, she stated \u201cYes\u201d and listed \u201cSBA\u201d as the agency to which she owed a debt. \nShe indicated she was currently delinquent on a loan. She provided the loan number and \nthe amount she owed ($133,000). She wrote \u201cI bought a franchise and took out a loan \nwith SBA. The business failed. I am currently working with my attorney discussing \nbankruptcy.\u201d (GE 1) She further stated: \u201cCurrently working with my attorney regarding \noptions.\u201d She also said: \u201cCourt not involved.\u201d (Tr. 57; GE 1) \nSection 26 also asks about delinquencies involving routine accounts. It specifically \nasks if the applicant in the last seven years had any property repossessed, either \nvoluntarily or involuntarily; defaulted on any type of loan; had bills or debts turned over to \na collection agency; had any account or credit card suspended, charged off, or canceled \nfor failing to pay as agreed; if the applicant had been over 120 days delinquent on any \ndebt not previously entered, or if applicant was currently over 120 days delinquent on any \ndebt. She answered \u201cNo.\u201d (GE 1) \nApplicant testified that she did not intentionally lie or attempt to deceive the \nGovernment. She said she disclosed the SBA delinquent loan and did not know why she \ndid not disclose any of her other debts. She said she thought the question was beyond \nseven years and not within seven years, but then said she could not swear to that being \nthe reason. She said she thought the debts were not over 120 days delinquent or she \nwas not contacted by collection agencies. She said her debts had not been turned over \nto collection agencies at the time she completed her SCA and there were not court actions \nagainst her. She was aware that two vehicles she purchased had been repossessed and \nthat she was unable to pay the numerous bills associated with the business. I did not find \nApplicant\u2019s explanations credible. I find that although she disclosed her defaulted SBA \nloan, she intentionally failed to disclose her numerous other delinquent debts. (Tr. 57-66, \n85-86) \nApplicant provided copies of her 2019 through 2021 employee performance \nappraisals reflecting her outstanding or above average performance.

In addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, \nthe adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating \nconditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concerns for personal conduct: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. The following will \nnormally result in an unfavorable national security eligibility determination, \nsecurity clearance action, or cancellation of further processing for national \nsecurity eligibility:  \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. I find the following potentially applicable: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \naward benefits or status, determine national security eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \nApplicant started a business in 2016. She obtained an SBA loan and used credit \ncards to fund the business\u2019 expenses and had loans for two vehicles. The business failed \nin 2018 and she defaulted on the SBA loan and numerous other accounts. Applicant \ndisclosed the defaulted SBA loan on her February 2020 SCA, but failed to disclose any \nof the other delinquent debts. She said she did not know why she did not disclose any of \nher other debts. She said she thought the question was beyond seven years and not \nwithin seven years, but could not be certain. She said she thought the debts were not \nover 120 days delinquent or she was not contacted by collection agencies. Her \nexplanations for why she did not disclose them are not credible. She was obviously aware \nthat she had closed her business in 2018 and could not pay the numerous bills associated \nwith it. She was aware that the two vehicles were repossessed. I find Applicant \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ndeliberately failed to disclose her delinquent debts, except for the SBA loan. The above \ndisqualifying condition applies. \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 17 are potentially applicable to the \ndisqualifying security concerns based on the facts: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts;  \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was caused \nor significantly contributed to by advice of legal counsel or a person with \nprofessional responsibilities for advising or instructing the individual \nspecifically concerning security processes. Upon being made aware of the \nrequirement to cooperate or provide information, the individual cooperated \nfully and truthfully; and \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment. \nApplicant did not make a prompt, good-faith effort to correct her omissions. She \nwas aware she had numerous delinquent debts and two repossessed vehicles in addition \nto her defaulted SBA loan. Failure to disclose information on an SCA is not a minor \noffense. Her conduct casts doubt on her reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. \nNone of the mitigating conditions apply. \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set out \nin AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 19 provides conditions that could raise security concerns. The following are \npotentially applicable: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nIn 2018, Applicant defaulted on her SBA loan and accumulated numerous \ndelinquent debts. There is sufficient evidence to support the application of the above \ndisqualifying conditions. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and  \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue.  \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems were the result of her starting a business in 2016 \nthat then failed in 2018. This was a circumstance beyond her control. Although Applicant \nsought guidance from an attorney and contemplated filing bankruptcy, she has not yet \naddressed the resolution of the SBA loan (SOR \u00b6 1.a-$133,000). Applicant testified that \nwhen the company went out of business in 2018, she initially spoke a few times with the \ncollection agency handling the SBA loan and was discussing bankruptcy, but she did not \ntake any action to resolve it. In June 2022, she spoke with the SBA and was advised to \nsubmit a form showing her assets and liabilities. She has not yet completed the form and \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nprovided minimal evidence of any additional efforts to resolve this debt. Applicant\u2019s \nlengthy delay in following through on resolving this debt and others does not constitute \nacting reasonably under the circumstances. I find AG \u00b6 20(b) has some application. \nApplicant has resolved or is resolving the delinquent debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e through \n1.i, and 1.k. AG \u00b6 20(d) applies to these debts. In addition to the SBA debt in SOR \u00b6 1.a, \nshe has not resolved the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b ($18,732), 1.c ($9,474), 1.d ($9,025), and \n1.j ($250). A week before her hearing she sent these creditors letters requesting an \nitemized bill from one and a request for a payment arrangement to another. These debts \nare not resolved.  \nThere is some evidence that she recently sought assistance from her attorney to \nresolve the remaining debts, but her delay in addressing these debts until shortly before \nher hearing is a concern. At this juncture, I cannot find that there are clear indications that \nher financial issues are under control. AG \u00b6 20(c) has minimal application. Although she \nbelieves there were fraudulent charges on one of her credit cards, even if she raised the \nconcerns initially with the creditor, she has not done anything else for years. There is \ninsufficient evidence to apply AG \u00b6 20(e). \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline E and Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 \n2(d) were addressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional comment. \nApplicant was aware she had numerous delinquent debts when she completed her \nSCA and failed to disclose her complete financial picture.

The government must be confident that those \nholding security clearances comply with rules and regulations, even when they are \ninconvenient, tedious, or when no one is watching. Being able to rely on those with \nsecurity clearances to use good judgment and be honest is the cornerstone of the \nprocess. To her credit, she has paid some of her creditors, but still has approximately \n$170,000 of delinquent debt that is not resolved. Applicant has not met her burden of \npersuasion. At this juncture, she has an unreliable financial track record. The record \nevidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability \nfor a security clearance. For these reasons, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the \nsecurity concerns arising under Guideline E, personal conduct, and Guideline F, financial \nconsiderations. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.d: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.e-1.i: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph   1.j:  \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph   1.k:  \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

(Id.) He also provided mitigating \ninformation. (Id.) His admissions are accepted as findings of fact. \nApplicant is a 38-year-old security officer who has worked for a defense contractor \nsince February 2020. (Item 3 at 7, 11-12) From July 2019 to February 2020, he was \nemployed as an appliance technician.

(Id. at 28-31) \nFinancial Considerations \nApplicant did not disclose any debts placed for collection or charged off in the \nprevious seven years on his March 22, 2020 SCA. (Item 1) On April 23, 2020, an Office \nof Personnel Management (OPM) investigator interviewed Applicant about his delinquent \ndebts. (Item 9) He was confronted with the negative financial information on his credit \nreport, including the SOR debts in collection or charged off, and he admitted his student \nloans were in collections. (Id. at 1-2) Applicant told the OPM investigator that the collection \nagent for his federal student loans contacted him in 2018, and he entered into a $5 \nmonthly rehabilitation agreement. (Id.) Applicant said that he paid the account on time \nafter completion of the rehabilitation agreement. (Id. at 2) He said the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.m \nis in good standing; he denied that he owed the insurance debt in SOR \u00b6 1.n; and he was \nunaware of the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.o. (Id. at 2-3) Later in his OPM interview, he said the \ncreditor for the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.o was the university which refused to give him his diploma \nfor his bachelor\u2019s degree until he paid the debt.

On December 22, 2021, the \nDE extended the student loan payment pause through May 1, 2022. The pause includes \nthe following relief measures for eligible loans: a suspension of loan payments; a 0% \ninterest rate; and stopped collections on defaulted loans. See Federal Student Aid \nwebsite, https://studentaid.gov/announcements-events/covid-19. \nApplicant\u2019s April 9, 2020 credit report shows the 12 student loans in the collections \nsection.

(Id.) They are all shown as closed and assigned to the government. (Id.) \nOn February 10, 2021, Applicant responded to DOD CAF interrogatories and said \nthe 12 federal student loans were paid, and then he checked the block indicating payment \narrangement have been made. (Item 4 at 3-6) The DOHA interrogatory instructions ask \nfor proof of making payments and documentation of payment arrangements. (Id. at 2) It \nalso includes examples of acceptable documentation, such as copies of cancelled \nchecks, bank statements, correspondence from the creditor, a record of payment \narrangements including payment history, and a credit report showing the account is paid, \nsettled in full, or being paid as agreed. (Id. at 7) He attached an incomplete personal \nfinancial statement, and a pay statement from his employment for November 2020.

(Id. at 7-9) \nThe June 14, 2021 SOR alleges 12 federal student loans placed for collection as \nfollows: \u00b6 1.a for $6,995; \u00b6 1.b for $5,201; \u00b6 1.c for $5,151; \u00b6 1.d for $4,213; \u00b6 1.e for \n$3,278; \u00b6 1.f for $2,114; \u00b6 1.g for $2,063; \u00b6 1.h for $1,986; \u00b6 1.i for $1,063; \u00b6 1.j for $978; \n\u00b6 1.k for $822; and \u00b6 1.l for $542. (Item 1) The SOR alleges three additional delinquent \ndebts as follows: \u00b6 1.m is a charged-off bank debt for $409; \u00b6 1.n is an insurance debt \nplaced for collection for $162; and \u00b6 1.o is a charged-off private education debt for $2,874. \nApplicant\u2019s July 13, 2021 SOR response states, \u201cI have worked with a Student \nLoan company to make my payments manageable and they are in good standing.\u201d (Item \n2 at 4) He provided a July 11, 2021 credit report which indicated his $34,406 in student \nloans were a \u201cclosed account\u201d and not listed as collection accounts.

Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The President \nhas authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicant\u2019s eligibility for \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \n4 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation.

Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \nThus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that it is based, in whole or \nin part, on any express or implied determination about applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or \npatriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the \nPresident, Secretary of Defense, and Director of National Intelligence have established \nfor issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR.

Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 \n(App. Bd.

Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \n5 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n          \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nThe Appeal Board explained the scope and rationale for the financial \nconsiderations security concern in ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) \n(citation omitted) as follows: \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might \nknowingly compromise classified information in order to raise money in \nsatisfaction of his or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the \ntotality of an applicant\u2019s financial history and circumstances. The Judge \nmust consider pertinent evidence regarding the applicant\u2019s self-control, \njudgment, and other qualities essential to protecting the national secrets as \nwell as the vulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive \npresumes a nexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines \nand an applicant\u2019s security eligibility. \nAG \u00b6 19 includes disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern and \nmay be disqualifying in this case: \u201c(a) inability to satisfy debts\u201d; and \u201c(c) a history of not \nmeeting financial obligations.\u201d \nIn ISCR Case No. 08-12184 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan. 7, 2010), the Appeal Board \nexplained: \nIt is. well-settled that adverse information from a credit report can normally \nmeet the substantial evidence standard and the government\u2019s obligations \nunder [Directive] \u00b6 E3.1.14 for pertinent allegations. At that point, the burden \nshifts to applicant to establish either that [he or] she is not responsible for \nthe debt or that matters in mitigation apply. \n(internal citation omitted). The record establishes the disqualifying conditions in AG \n\u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c), requiring additional inquiry about the possible applicability of \nmitigating conditions. Discussion of the disqualifying conditions is contained in the \nmitigation section, infra. \nThe financial considerations mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are as follows: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n \n \n \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \n6 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \nIn ISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013), the DOHA Appeal \nBoard explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for proving the applicability of mitigating \nconditions as follows: \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of \na security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government \npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the \napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The \nstandard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in \nEgan, supra. \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access \nto classified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nDirective, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 2(b).  \nApplicant experienced underemployment and unemployment which were \ncircumstances beyond his control, and they adversely affected his finances. However, \n\u201c[e]ven if applicant\u2019s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to \ncircumstances outside his [or her] control, the judge could still consider whether applicant \nhas since acted in a reasonable manner when dealing with those financial difficulties.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. Bd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 03-\n13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005); ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, \n2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999)).    \nAnother component under AG \u00b6 20(a) is whether Applicant maintained contact with \ncreditors and attempted to negotiate partial payments to keep debts current. He did not \nprove that he maintained contact with several of his creditors or that he made offers to \nmake partial payments to them. \nApplicant is credited with paying the insurance debt in SOR \u00b6 1.n for $162. He said \nhe paid it two years ago, and it is not on his current credit report. \nApplicant is credited with making some payments on his student loans starting in \nOctober 2020. His latest credit reports show his 12 student loans as $0 past due and \nthese debts are in pays as agreed status. There are residual questions about what \nApplicant did to bring his student loans to current status on his credit reports.

For purposes of this \ndecision, I will presume he brought his 12 federal student loans to current status by \nmaking payments beginning in October 2020. \nComplete reliance on the COVID-19 pandemic-based student loans deferment to \nestablish mitigation for security clearance purposes is misplaced. Applicant\u2019s student \nloans were delinquent from 2013 to about 2017 or 2018, and again in 2019 and the first \nnine months in 2020. See ISCR Case No. 20-03208 at 2 (App. Bd. July 6, 2021); ISCR \nCase No. 20-01527 at 2 (App. Bd. June 7, 2021). He did not establish he was unable to \nestablish a payment plan and make some payments for several years before October \n2020.   \nThe SOR did not allege that Applicant failed to disclose any delinquent debts on \nhis SCA and before being confronted during his OPM interview. The DOHA Appeal Board \nlisted four circumstances in which conduct not alleged in an SOR may be considered as \nfollows: \u201c(a) in assessing an applicant\u2019s credibility; (b) in evaluating an applicant\u2019s \nevidence of extenuation, mitigation, or changed circumstances; (c) in considering whether \nthe applicant has demonstrated successful rehabilitation; and (d) in applying the whole-\nperson concept.\u201d ISCR Case No. 20-02787 at 4 (App. Bd. Mar. 9, 2022) (citing ISCR \nCase No. 15-07369 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 16, 2017)). The non-SOR allegations will not be \nconsidered except for the four purposes described in ISCR Case No. 20-02787 at 4 (App. \nBd. Mar. 9, 2022). \nOn April 23, 2020 an OPM investigator questioned Applicant about his delinquent \nstudent loans. He said he had been making payments on them since 2018. He said in \n2018, he made $5 monthly loan rehabilitation payments. However, his credit report \nreflects that he started making payments of unspecified amounts in October 2020. His \nrecent credit reports do not fully establish mitigation of his student loans. See ISCR Case \nNo. 14-03612 at 3 (Aug. 25, 2015) (\u201cIndeed, even if a credit report states that a debt has \nbeen paid, that fact alone does not, in and of itself, resolve concerns arising from the \ndilatory nature of an applicant\u2019s response to his debts or other circumstances that detract \nfrom an applicant\u2019s judgment and reliability. In this case, the Judge commented on the \nabsence of detailed evidence about how Applicant addressed his finances and \nreasonably had doubts about his clearance eligibility based on that lack of evidence\u201d). \nApplicant\u2019s history of non-payment of his federal student loan debt from 2013 to \n2017 or 2018, in 2019, and the first nine months of 2020, has important security \nimplications. The timing of his resumption of payments, after receipt of notice of the \nsecurity concern during his OPM interview, suggests that he may have resumed \npayments to address security concerns and not because of his recognition of his financial \nresponsibilities. See ISCR Case No. 20-01004 at 3 (App. Bd. June 28, 2021) (\u201cResolution \nof a delinquent debt does not preclude further inquiry or examination regarding it.

He did not provide copies of established payment \nplans, correspondence from or to creditors, history of payments from the creditors, or \nevidence of payments from his bank. There is insufficient assurance that his financial \nproblems are being resolved. Under all the circumstances, he failed to establish mitigation \nof financial considerations security concerns. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), \u201c[t]he ultimate determination\u201d of whether to grant a security \nclearance \u201cmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines\u201d and the whole-person concept. My comments under Guideline F are \nincorporated in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that guideline but some warrant additional comment. \nApplicant is a 38-year-old security officer who has worked for a defense contractor \nsince February 2020. He served in the Army National Guard from January 2001 to July \n2007, and he received an honorable discharge. In 2012, he said he received a bachelor\u2019s \ndegree, and in 2013, he received an associate\u2019s degree in information technology and \nnetworking. There is no evidence of involvement with illegal drugs, security violations, \nabuse of alcohol, or criminal conduct. \nApplicant provided important financial mitigating information. His finances were \nharmed by several circumstances beyond his control. He mitigated the debt in SOR \n\u00b6 1.n. \nThe evidence against grant of a security clearance is more substantial at this time. \nApplicant did not provide documentation about why he was unable to make greater \nprogress resolving several delinquent debts. He did not provide documentary evidence \nshowing a track record of consistent payments to several SOR creditors.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is 44 years old. He is married, and has two children. He holds the position of Fleet Support Engineer. He is seeking to obtain a security clearance in connection with his employment. Guideline F - Financial Considerations The Government alleged that Applicant is ineligible for a clearance because he made financial decisions that indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which raise questions about his reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. The SOR alleged that Applicant failed to file his Federal income tax returns for tax years 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018 and 2019. In his answer, Applicant admits the allegation with explanations. (Applicant\u2019s Answer to SOR.) Applicant served in the U.S. Marine Corps on active duty from April 1998 to August 2003. He was deployed mostly in Asia. He advanced to the enlisted rank of Corporal, E-4. He received a Good Conduct Medal, and an honorable discharge. During his military career he held a security clearance without incident. In 2001, while in the military, Applicant met his wife, a Japanese national, in Japan. They married in 2002, and have raised two children in Japan. After his military service, Applicant began working for defense contractors. In 2015, he and his wife began having serious marital problems.

Applicant submitted nothing more. DOHA received the final transcript \nof the hearing (Tr.) on June 30, 2022. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is 44 years old. He is married, and has two children. He holds the \nposition of Fleet Support Engineer. He is seeking to obtain a security clearance in \nconnection with his employment. \nGuideline F - Financial Considerations \nThe Government alleged that Applicant is ineligible for a clearance because he \nmade financial decisions that indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which raise questions about his \nreliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant failed to file his Federal income tax returns for \ntax years 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018 and 2019. In his answer, Applicant admits the \nallegation with explanations. (Applicant\u2019s Answer to SOR.) \nApplicant served in the U.S. Marine Corps on active duty from April 1998 to \nAugust 2003. He was deployed mostly in Asia. He advanced to the enlisted rank of \nCorporal, E-4. He received a Good Conduct Medal, and an honorable discharge. \nDuring his military career he held a security clearance without incident. \nIn 2001, while in the military, Applicant met his wife, a Japanese national, in \nJapan. They married in 2002, and have raised two children in Japan. After his military \nservice, Applicant began working for defense contractors. In 2015, he and his wife \nbegan having serious marital problems. They separated and were living apart, as \nApplicant moved out of the family residence. \nApplicant understood his responsibility to file annual income Federal income tax \nreturns, but was confronted with several obstacles. \nSome of the documentation \nApplicant needed to prepare his income taxes was located at his wife\u2019s house, the \nfamily residence, and it was not a good time for him to try to get it. Applicant missed the \nfiling date for his 2015 Federal income tax returns. \nAs time passed, this situation \ncontinued, and Applicant failed to file his Federal income tax returns for tax years 2016, \n2017, 2018, and 2019. Applicant explained that in order for him to file the Federal \nincome tax returns, he would need his wife to sign off on the returns. Even though she \nis not a U.S. citizen, her signature is necessary on all tax documents.

Applicant just let things snowball.  (Tr. p.\n45.)     \n \nBetween 2015 and 2016, with the intention of divorcing his wife, Applicant \ncontacted a Japanese attorney to have him prepare a separation agreement for him and \nhis wife. (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit B.) Applicant struggled with a language barrier and was \nuncertain about this process. \nIn 2017, Applicant reconciled with his wife. Before \nmoving back in with the Applicant, his wife, who was moving her household to be with \nthe Applicant, went through all of Applicant\u2019s paperwork that he had left at the house \nand got rid of it, which included some documentation he needed to prepare his income \ntax returns. \nIn January 2020, Applicant contacted and hired a professional tax preparer to \nassist him in getting his delinquent Federal income tax returns filed. \n(Applicant\u2019s \nExhibits C and G.) Due to the fact that Applicant lives abroad, coupled with COVID 19 \nand its restrictions, and the fact that the IRS had incorrect information on record for the \nApplicant, it has taken longer for him to obtain information he needed to properly \nprepare his returns. With the assistance of the professional tax preparer, Applicant was \neventually able to file all of the income tax returns in question. (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit A.) \nOn August 2, 2021, Applicant filed his Federal income tax returns for tax year \n2015; on July 26, 2021, Applicant filed his Federal income tax return for tax year 2016; \non July 19, 2021, Applicant filed his Federal income tax return for tax year 2017; on July \n5, 2021, Applicant filed his Federal income tax return for tax year 2018; on July 5, 2021, \nApplicant filed his Federal income tax return for tax year 2019. \nAll of Applicant\u2019s \nFederal income tax returns alleged in the SOR have been filed with the IRS. Applicant \nstates that he received about $12,000 in tax refunds as a result of filing his Federal \nincome tax returns. (Tr. p. 33.) Applicant testified that he filed his most recent Federal \nincome tax returns for tax years 2020 and 2021 in a timely fashion, or that an extension \nwas filed on his behalf. (Tr. pp. 27-28.) \nApplicant testified that his relationship with his wife has improved and he now \nconsiders their marriage to be in good standing. There is no longer a problem with \nhaving her sign any tax documentation, and going forward Applicant plans to file all of \nhis Federal income tax returns on time. \nApplicant has been working for his current employer since March 2020. He is a \nhard worker and excellent performer on the job. Applicant has received a number of \nawards, commendations and accolades for his work performance. \nHe has also \nreceived two raises and two bonuses. (Applicant\u2019s Exhibits D and I.) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance \ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to \npotential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline F -  Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for Financial Considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. One is potentially applicable in this case: \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state or local income tax as required. \nApplicant failed to file his Federal income tax returns for five years from \n2015 through 2019 due to living abroad, being involved in a marital separation \nand pending divorce, difficulty in being able to access information he needed to \nprepare his returns, and COVID 19 restrictions. Even so, his actions or inactions \nboth demonstrated a history of not addressing his responsibility to file his Federal \nincome tax returns. The evidence is sufficient to raise the above disqualifying \nconditions. \nThe following mitigating conditions under the Financial Considerations guideline \nare potentially applicable under AG \u00b6 20. \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nApplicant has now filed all of the Federal income tax returns in question and \nreceived about $12,000 in tax refunds as a result of his filings. However, Applicant has \nno good reason as to why he was so delinquent in filing his returns. A pattern of \nresponsibility and good judgment has not been shown. He failed to file Federal income \ntax returns for 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018 and 2019. This shows irresponsibility. Even \nthough there were obstacles he encountered, like living overseas, marital problems, and \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \nCOVID 19 and its restrictions, he must still adhere to Federal laws and regulations that \nrequire him to file his Federal income tax returns in a timely fashion. He has been \nderelict and irresponsible, not once, but at least five consecutive times. He filed these \nFederal income tax returns just last year. Furthermore, the record was left open to \nallow the Applicant the opportunity to provide additional mitigating evidence to show that \nhe has filed his most recent Federal income tax returns for tax years 2020, and 2021, in \na timely fashion. Applicant failed to submit anything. It can be inferred that these \nreturns, like the others, were not filed in a timely fashion. Under the circumstances, he \nhas not demonstrated sufficient responsibility, good judgment, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness. \nMitigating Conditions 20(a), 20(b), and 20(d) do not show full \nmitigation. \nThere is evidence in the record to show that Applicant\u2019s Federal income tax \nreturns alleged in the SOR have been filed, and he is current with his obligations to the \nIRS. However, there is insufficient evidence in the record to show that the Applicant \nhas carried his burden of proof to establish mitigation of the government security \nconcerns under Guideline F. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Applicant is commended \nfor his service in the military. Going forward, he must follow Federal law that requires \nhim to file annual Federal income tax returns in a timely fashion without distractions or \nexcuses. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nrelevant facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I conclude Applicant has not \nmitigated the Financial Considerations security concern. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a. \nAGAINST Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for \na security clearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact The SOR alleged two Chapter 7 bankruptcies, three unpaid judgments, and two charged-off debts. Applicant admitted all seven allegations. (Item 2.) His admissions are incorporated into these findings. Applicant is 51 years old and unmarried. He graduated from high school in 1989. He lives with a woman with whom he has a child. In July 2020, he began a position as a warehouse specialist with a defense contractor. He has been employed since 2008, but has not earned sufficient money to pay his bills, which lead to financial difficulties and delinquencies. (Items 3 and 4) In May 2002, Applicant filed his first Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition. It was discharged in September 2002. (Item 5) The amount of debt discharged is not in this record. In October 2016, Applicant filed his second Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition. In February 2017, the court discharged $30,732 of debt. (Item 6) Subsequent to the February 2017 discharge of debts, two judgements were entered against Applicant in July 2019, one for $581 and one for $499. A judgment for $3,971 was entered in February 2021. (Items, 7, 8, and 9) In January 2020, his vehicle was involuntarily repossessed, resulting in a charged-off debt for $14,264.

On May \n13, 2022, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) assigned the case to me. \nFindings of Fact \nThe SOR alleged two Chapter 7 bankruptcies, three unpaid judgments, and two \ncharged-off debts. Applicant admitted all seven allegations. (Item 2.) His admissions are \nincorporated into these findings. \nApplicant is 51 years old and unmarried. He graduated from high school in 1989. \nHe lives with a woman with whom he has a child. In July 2020, he began a position as a \nwarehouse specialist with a defense contractor. He has been employed since 2008, but \nhas not earned sufficient money to pay his bills, which lead to financial difficulties and \ndelinquencies. (Items 3 and 4) \nIn May 2002, Applicant filed his first Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition. It was \ndischarged in September 2002. (Item 5) The amount of debt discharged is not in this \nrecord. In October 2016, Applicant filed his second Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition. In \nFebruary 2017, the court discharged $30,732 of debt. (Item 6) \nSubsequent to the February 2017 discharge of debts, two judgements were \nentered against Applicant in July 2019, one for $581 and one for $499. A judgment for \n$3,971 was entered in February 2021. (Items, 7, 8, and 9) In January 2020, his vehicle \nwas involuntarily repossessed, resulting in a charged-off debt for $14,264. In August \n2020, a personal loan was charged off in the amount of $4,051. These debts total about \n$19,400. None of them have been resolved or are being addressed. \nAccording to a budget Applicant submitted with his 2016 Chapter 7 bankruptcy \npetition, his net monthly income was $1,172 and expenses were $2,166, resulting in a \n$994 monthly shortage. (Item 6 at 40-43) During his October 2020 background interview, \nApplicant told the investigator that his financial situation had improved since he became \nemployed with the defense contractor in 2020. (Item 4 at 5) Applicant did not submit a \nmore current budget or documentation that he obtained credit or financial counseling or \nsought assistance for addressing and managing his delinquent debts. \nPolicies \nThe national security eligibility action was taken under Executive Order 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDoD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the National Security Adjudicative \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nGuidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to \nHold a Sensitive Position (AG), which became effective within the DoD on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility to hold a sensitive position, the \nadministrative judge must consider the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the AGs. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of \nhuman behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in AG \n\u00b6 2(a), describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \nwhole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to [sensitive] \ninformation will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable \ntrustworthiness decision. \nA person who applies for access to sensitive information seeks to enter into a \nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to sensitive information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nsensitive information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of sensitive \ninformation. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe trustworthiness concerns relating to the guideline for financial considerations \nare set out in AG \u00b6 18, which reads in pertinent part: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. . . .   \nThe Appeal Board explained the scope and rationale for the financial \nconsiderations security concern in ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) \n(citation omitted) as follows: \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might \nknowingly compromise classified information in order to raise money in \nsatisfaction of his or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the \ntotality of an applicant\u2019s financial history and circumstances. The Judge \nmust consider pertinent evidence regarding the applicant\u2019s self-control, \njudgment, and other qualities essential to protecting the national secrets as \nwell as the vulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive \npresumes a nexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines \nand an applicant\u2019s security eligibility. \nAG \u00b6 19 describes two conditions that could raise trustworthiness concerns and \nmay be disqualifying in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant has a history of being unable to satisfy financial obligations, which \nincludes a Chapter 7 bankruptcy in May 2002, and another Chapter 7 bankruptcy in \nOctober 2016. His financial problems continue to date, as documented by unpaid \njudgments and charged-off accounts. The evidence raises both disqualifying conditions, \nthereby shifting the burden to Applicant to rebut, extenuate, or mitigate those concerns. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \nThe guideline includes conditions in AG \u00b6 20 that could mitigate trustworthiness \nconcerns arising from Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties: \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or \nthere are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under \ncontrol; and \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts.  \nThere is insufficient evidence to establish mitigation under any of the above \nmitigating conditions. Applicant failed to demonstrate that his ongoing delinquent debts \nare unlikely to continue or recur, or that his reliability and trustworthiness is not in \nquestion. AG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply. He provided some evidence that his financial \ndelinquencies may have occurred as the result of periods of unemployment or \nunderemployment, which may have been circumstances beyond his control. He did not \npresent evidence that he attempted to manage his debts during those times. The \nevidence establishes minimal mitigation under AG \u00b6 20(b). \nApplicant did not provide evidence that he participated in credit or financial \ncounseling or that he developed a reliable plan to resolve the debts. The record indicates \nthat his debts are not under control. AG \u00b6 20(c) does not apply. He did not submit \nevidence that he made a good-faith effort to resolve the outstanding judgments or debts, \nhe accrued after discharging over $30,000 of debts in February 2017 through bankruptcy. \nAG \u00b6 20(d) does not apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a public trust position by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n     \n \n \n \n           \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n_________________ \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for \na trustworthiness determination must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon \ncareful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is a 51-year-old man, who has \na history of financial delinquencies that began prior to 2002 when he filed his first Chapter \n7 bankruptcy and continues into the present. Overall, the record evidence leaves me with \nquestions as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a public trust position, as he has \nnot established a reliable record of resolving his delinquent debts and demonstrating \nresponsible judgment. For these reasons, I conclude Applicant did not meet his burden \nto mitigate the trustworthiness concerns arising from his financial problems. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.g: \n   AGAINST APPLICANT \n  Against Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a public trust \nposition. Eligibility for access to sensitive information is denied. \nSHARI DAM \nAdministrative Judge \n6 \n",

Eligibility for \naccess to classified information is granted. \nHistory of the Case \nOn May 28, 2021, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued Applicant a Statement \nof Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under Guideline F, financial considerations. \nDOD acted under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information \nwithin Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \n(Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines effective June 8, 2017 (AG). \nApplicant answered the SOR on June 23, 2021, and he requested a hearing before \nan administrative judge. The scheduling of this hearing was delayed because of the \nCOVID-19 pandemic. The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a \nnotice of hearing on June 16, 2022, and the hearing was convened as scheduled on June \n21, 2022, using video teleconferencing capabilities. Applicant was originally notified of the \nhearing date of June 21, 2022, by an email that I sent to him on June 4, 2022 (See hearing \n1 \n\nexhibit (HE) III). The Government offered exhibits (GE) 1 through 5, which were admitted \ninto evidence without objection, except for GE 5, which objection was overruled. The \nGovernment\u2019s exhibit list and its discovery letter sent to Applicant were marked as HE I \nand II. Applicant testified, and offered exhibits (AE) A through R. The record was kept \nopen to allow Applicant to submit additional evidence, which he did in the form of AE S \nthrough U. All were admitted without objections. DOHA received the hearing transcript \n(Tr.) on July 6, 2022. \nProcedural Issue \nThe Government moved to amend SOR \u00b6 1.a to name the Federal Government \nrather than the named state as the proper taxing authority for this allegation. Applicant \nhad no objection and the motion was granted. (Tr. 10-12) \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant admitted some of the allegations and denied others. His admissions are \nincorporated into these findings of fact. After a review of the pleadings and evidence, I \nmake the following additional findings of fact. \nApplicant is a 45-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has worked for \nhis current employer as a heavy equipment operator since October 2003. He worked on \nthe commercial side of the operation until 2020, when he was asked by the company to \ncomplete a security clearance application (SCA) so that he could receive a clearance and \nwork on the government-contract side of the company. His job location is at various \nlocations in the world out at sea. He works 30 days on shift and then 30 days off shift. He \nis not paid when he is off shift.

He has been married 22 years and has three \nadult children. His wife does not work outside the home. He is a high school graduate. \n(Tr. 33, 43-44, 47; GE 1-2) \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant had a tax debt and 26 past due, collection, and\ncharged-off debts totaling approximately $47,588. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.aa) The debts are\nestablished by Applicant\u2019s admissions, court document, and entries on two credit reports.\n(Tr. 40; GE 1-5; Answer to SOR) \n \n \n \nApplicant explained that his delinquent debts were exacerbated by several events \nthat put him into financial difficulties. In 2018, he experienced a medical situation involving \nblood clots that resulted in hospitalization and four months off from work with no pay. \nAlso, in 2017 or 2018 his father passed away, and Applicant was burdened with paying \nhis funeral expenses. In 2019, he lost his brother in an accident and also became \nresponsible for his final expenses. He had to use high interest loans to pay for the funeral \nexpenses. Additionally, his workday shifts were cut back. Applicant explained that most \nof his debts accrued prior to 2020 before he was seeking a clearance. Once he submitted \nhis SCA and realized his financial history was significant, he began making efforts to \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \naddress his delinquent debts. This task proved more difficult because of his \u201cat sea\u201d job \nwhere access to the internet was limited to nonexistent and cell phone use was prohibited. \nHe has paid several debts, established payment plans on others, and hired a debt relief \ncompany (DRC) to help address some debts. (Tr. 33-34, 39, 41, 50-51, 54, 56-58, 66-67) \nThe status of Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts is as follows: \nSOR \u00b6 1.a-$3,000. The SOR originally alleged this as a state tax debt, however, \nthe amendment and evidence established that this was a federal tax debt. Applicant \npresented documentation showing he had no state tax debt. Once Applicant was advised \nthat this was a federal tax debt, he contacted the IRS about how to pay this debt. This \ndebt is being resolved. He has filed all of his tax returns. (Tr. 59-60; AE A, S) \nSOR \u00b6 1.b-$1,350. Applicant entered into a payment agreement with the creditor \nin June 2022 and documented both the agreement and his first payment of $100 on June \n20, 2022. This debt is being resolved. (AE B; Answer to SOR) \nSOR \u00b6 1.c-$23,890. This debt arises out of an automobile purchase Applicant \nmade in approximately 2016-2017. After the purchase, Applicant had serious mechanical \nproblems with the car. He voluntarily turned it into the dealership and heard nothing further \nabout it until his security clearance case brought it up.

Applicant incurred this debt when he was out of work for four \nmonths due to medical reasons and his landlord began eviction proceedings on the \nresidence Applicant and his family were renting.

Applicant also presented his \nJune 2022 job performance appraisal where he was rated at the highest level (#5-\ncommendable) in all categories. (AE Q-R) \n \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation about potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nAG \u00b6 18 expresses the security concern for financial considerations: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. I have \nconsidered all of them under AG \u00b6 19 and the following potentially apply: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired; \nApplicant had multiple delinquent debts that were unpaid or unresolved. Both of \nthe above disqualifying conditions are raised by the evidence. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. I have considered all of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 \nand the following potentially apply: \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nApplicant had periods where he came under financial distress that led to some of \nhis delinquent debts. He was the only relative in a position to pay for his father\u2019s and \nbrother\u2019s funerals in the span of a few years. He had to use high-interest loans to pay for \nthem. He also experienced a medical situation that caused him to be off work, without \npay, for four months that put him behind on several debts. In addition, he had his work \ndays reduced, which impacted his overall finances. These were circumstances beyond \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nhis control. Applicant eventually acted responsibly by entering into a debt payment plan \nwith a DRC and other creditors, settling and paying other debts, and contacting one \ncreditor who disavowed the debt. He made arrangements with the IRS to pay his \ndelinquent tax debt. While his financial state is not perfect, perfection is not required. \nAdditionally, his explanation for not addressing the debts in a timelier manner is very \nplausible given his company\u2019s recent decision to have him work on classified contracts \nand the logistical difficulties he has in contacting creditors when he is on the job for a \nmonth at a time while at sea. He has established a track record of steady payments, which \nhave paid or are currently paying his delinquent debts. There are clear indications that \nhis debts are being resolved and that he is making good-faith efforts to do so. Applicant \ncredibly disputed a debt involving one of the medical bills. All the above mitigating \nconditions substantially apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guideline and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nrelevant facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 \n2(d) were addressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. I \nconsidered Applicant\u2019s military service, his years of civilian service, his 2022 job appraisal \nand the strong recommendation of his coworker. While Applicant could have been timelier \nin resolving of his debts, he eventually paid some and established workable plans for the \nremainder. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant mitigated the financial considerations security concerns. \n7 \n\n________________________ \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs: 1.a-1.aa: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance. \nEligibility for access to classified information is granted. \nRobert E.

The \nSOR alleges untimely filed tax returns for the 2012 through 2019 tax years and \ndelinquent federal taxes totaling $10,389 for those same tax years. In his Answer, \nApplicant admitted the SOR allegations with additional comments. The SOR allegations \nare established through Applicant\u2019s admissions and the Government\u2019s evidence.

He claimed he was not aware that he was behind on \nfiling his federal tax returns or paying his federal taxes until January 2018, when he had \na falling out with his ex-wife. At that time, he claims that he learned that he had not filed \nhis federal income tax returns for the \u201cthree previous years.\u201d In June or July of 2018, he \nreviewed his financial documents and determined that he had not filed his federal \nincome tax returns for all the tax years listed in the SOR. He claimed that he \nimmediately went to a CPA to help him file his late tax returns and make payments on \nhis late taxes. He claimed that, with the help of his CPA, he has now mailed all of his \ndelinquent federal tax returns to the IRS. He claimed that he started making payments \non his late taxes in about 2019 or 2020, at about the time his interim clearance was \ngranted. He claimed that he tried to make automatic predetermined payment \narrangements with the IRS, but they \u201care not allowing that now.\u201d (Tr.16-17, 20-35, 38-\n39; GE 1, 2; AE A-C) \nThere is documentary evidence from a commercial tax filing service that \nApplicant submitted his 2019 and 2020 federal income tax returns on July 14, 2021. \nApplicant claimed that he filed his 2016 and 2017 federal income tax returns in August \n2021. He provided documents from a commercial tax filing service that arguably confirm \nthese late submissions. He provided a receipt from the U.S. Postal Service (USPS) that \nhe claimed is evidence that he mailed his 2013 and 2018 federal income tax return to \nthe IRS in August 2022. He also provided documents from the IRS showing that he \nmade payments on his delinquent taxes for tax years 2012, 2014, 2015, and 2021. \nThese IRS documents confirm that Applicant filed his federal income tax returns for \nthose tax years, but, with the exception of the 2012 tax year, there is no documentary \nevidence in the record showing that Applicant filed any of his late income tax returns or \nmade any payments on his delinquent taxes until after the SOR was issued.

According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial\nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to\nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be\ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental\nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An\nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to\nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \nApplicant has a history of problems with meeting his tax obligations. He failed to \ntimely file eight years of federal income tax returns, and he has delinquent federal tax \ndebt. The evidence is sufficient to raise the above disqualifying conditions. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay\noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and  \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nFailure to comply with tax laws suggests that an applicant has a problem with \nabiding by well-established government rules and systems. Voluntary compliance with \nrules and systems is essential for protecting classified information. See, e.g., ISCR \nCase No. 16-01726 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 28, 2018). A person who fails repeatedly to fulfill \nhis or her legal obligations, such as filing tax returns and paying taxes when due, does \nnot demonstrate the high degree of good judgment and reliability required of those \ngranted access to classified information. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-01382 at 4 (App. \nBd. May 16, 2018). \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant claimed that he was not aware that he was behind on his tax \nobligations because his understanding was that his ex-wife was taking care of these \nobligations. A degree of ignorance to one\u2019s financial situation may suggest an \nindifference to the proper satisfaction of legal obligations that draws into question \nApplicant\u2019s willingness or capacity to comply with the sometimes complex rules \ngoverning the handling and safeguarding of classified information. ISCR Case No. 18-\n02914 at 4 (App. Bd. Jan. 18, 2020). Accordingly, Applicant\u2019s tax filing and payment \ndelinquencies were not due to circumstances beyond his control. Even if one were to \nassume for the sake of argument that his failure to file and pay his taxes as required \nwas due to circumstances beyond his control, he would still need to show that he has \nacted responsibly under the circumstances. His admission that he has fallen into his old \nhabit of relying on his wife to stay on top of his finances undermines his ability to do so.  \nWhile Applicant has arguably remedied his late income tax return filings and has \nmade some sporadic payments on his delinquent federal taxes, he began these efforts \nafter being put on notice that his failure on these fronts might interfere with his ability to \nhold a security clearance. With the exception of his 2012 Federal tax return, which he \nfiled after submitting his SF 86 and after his clearance interview, he remedied his other \ntax filing delinquencies and made the aforementioned payments on his delinquent taxes \nafter the SOR was issued. An applicant who begins to resolve security concerns only \nafter having been placed on notice that his or her clearance is in jeopardy may lack the \njudgment and willingness to follow rules and regulations when his or her personal \ninterests are not threatened. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-04110 at 3 (App. Bd. Sep. \n26, 2019). The timing of these efforts undermines any claims that he was acting in good \nfaith or acting responsibly under the circumstances. \nApplicant sought assistance with his taxes from a commercial tax filing service, \nwhich resulted in him arguably filing his late federal tax returns and paying some of his \ndelinquent federal taxes. However, he still has outstanding tax debts, and there is no \nevidence of a payment arrangement with the IRS. Additionally, viewing the evidence as \nfavorably toward Applicant as possible, he has only timely filed his 2021 federal tax \nreturn. He therefore has not shown reform and rehabilitation, or a track record of \nvoluntary compliance. For these reasons and his return to a reliance on his wife to \nmonitor his finances, I am unable to find that his financial problems are under control or \nare being resolved. Applicant\u2019s failures to comply with his federal tax obligations \ncontinue to cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. I \nfind that the security concerns arising out of Applicant\u2019s untimely tax returns and \ndelinquent taxes are not mitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n          \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant did not \nmitigate the financial considerations security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \na security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nBenjamin R. Dorsey \nAdministrative Judge \n7 \n",

(Tr. at 22-28; GE 1 at 5-7, 10-11; GE 5.) \nParagraph 1 \u2013 Guideline K, Handling Protected Information \nThe Government alleges two incidents in which Applicant failed to comply with his \nemployer\u2019s rules and regulations for handling protected information. Both incidents \noccurred in 2019 and involved Applicant\u2019s use of his work computer while in Mexico. After \nthe first incident in January 2019, he was verbally warned by his employer (Company A) \nthat his use of a company computer on an Internet network while he was in Mexico \nviolated company policy (SOR 1.a). After he again used his work computer in Mexico in \nFebruary 2019, he was terminated (SOR 1.b). Applicant admitted both allegations in his \nAnswer. \nThe details regarding these two incidents developed by the record evidence are \nthe following: \n1.a Verbal warning.

At that time he was living near the \nMexican border and his wife was living and working in Mexico near the border. His young \nchild was living with Applicant\u2019s wife. He crossed the border \u201ccontinuously\u201d to see his child \nand wife. Applicant worked from his home in the United States, but also worked in Mexico \nwhen visiting his family. His work required that he connect his computer to the internet \nwhen he was working in Mexico. Company A discovered that he was logging onto its \ncomputer network from a location in Mexico. He used his wife\u2019s Wi-Fi system to access \nthe internet. At first he did not know that his actions violated company policy. He testified \nthat he was merely trying to fulfill his family obligations and do his job. His supervisor \ncounseled him that his actions violated company policy. (Tr. at 28-37.) \n1.b Employment termination. The next month Applicant repeated his action of \nconnecting his company computer to the internet while visiting his family in Mexico. \nCompany A terminated him. At the hearing he admitted that he knowingly violated \ncompany policy. (Tr. at 37- 39.) \nParagraph 2 \u2013 Guideline M, Use of Information Technology \nIn this paragraph of the SOR, the Government alleges two separate incidents in \nNovember 2014 involving Applicant\u2019s use of his work computer in violation of another \nemployer\u2019s (Company B) policy (SOR 2.a and 2.b). In addition the Government cross-\nalleges the two aforementioned incidents involving connecting to an Internet network in \nMexico, as set forth in paragraphs 1.a and 1.b of the SOR (SOR 2.c). \nThe details regarding the two incidents in 2014 are the following: \n2.a Written counseling. On November 4, 2014, Applicant received written \ncounseling from his supervisor at Company B for failing to communicate with his\nsupervisor effectively and for loading software onto his work computer in violation of\nCompany B\u2019s policy. In his Answer, Applicant denied the allegation claiming that he did \nnot receive any counseling. At the hearing he testified that he did not recall being\ncounselled by his supervisor. He did recall that his supervisor asked that employees\nprovide him with a list of all the software loaded on their computers and he determined \nthat Applicant\u2019s list was incomplete. Applicant was advised that his actions were\nunacceptable and against company policy. Applicant then removed the disallowed \nsoftware from his company computer after being \u201cyelled\u201d at by his supervisor. (Tr. at 40-\n44; GE 3.) \n \n \n \n \n \n2.b Employment termination. On November 20, 2014, Company B terminated \nApplicant for his failure to communicate with company staff and management about a \nserious error Applicant made to a client\u2019s online system. Applicant testified that he was \nusing a client\u2019s database and he \u201cmistakenly removed some information.\u201d He testified that \nhe was questioned about his mistake.

The SOR cross alleges the allegations set forth in paragraph \n1 of the SOR under Guideline K in this subparagraph under Guideline M. \nParagraph 3 - Guideline E, Personal Conduct \nThe Government alleges two instances in which Applicant provided false \ninformation in his 2015 e-QIP. Both falsifications relate to his 2014 written warning (SOR \n3.a) and employment termination (SOR 3.b), which Applicant did not disclose in his e-\nQIP, as required. In both allegations, the Government alleges that the omissions in the e-\nQIP were deliberate. The Government also cross-alleges under Guideline E the \nallegations set forth in SOR subparagraphs 1.a, 1.b, 2.a, and 2.b. In his Answer he \nadmitted the falsification allegations and provided additional comments. \nThe details regarding the two falsification allegations are the following: \n3.a Failure to disclose November 2014 employment termination for cause. In \nSection 13A of the e-QIP Applicant was required to provide the reason for his termination \nfrom Company B in November 2014. He responded by writing, \u201cI was laid off due to \ncompany downsizing.\u201d At the hearing Applicant acknowledged that his response was \nfalse. He explained he did not \u201cwant to remember that chapter,\u201d but he said that he told \nthe investigator the truth. An investigator in or about 2016 first interviewed applicant. The \ninterview following his submission of the e-QIP in November 2015 is not in the record. \n(Tr. at 46-47; GE 1 at 13.) \n3.b Failure to disclose November 2014 written warning from Company B and his \ntermination, as alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a and 2.b. Another question in Section 13A of the e-\nQIP asks for disclosure about receiving any written warnings from Employer B or being \n\u201cofficially reprimanded, suspended, or disciplined for misconduct in the workplace.\u201d \nApplicant responded \u201cNo.\u201d At the hearing, he explained that he made a mistake and used \n\u201cbad judgment\u201d by falsely answering this question. He also testified that he disclosed his \ntermination during his two background interviews. Only the most recent interview, which \ntook place in September 2019, appears in the record. In the investigator\u2019s summary of \nApplicant\u2019s 2019 interview, the investigator noted that Applicant discussed his 2014 \ntermination by Company B and commented that Applicant stated he provided information \nregarding that incident in his first interview after the submission of his 2015 e-QIP. (Tr. at \n47-48; GE 1 at 13; GE 2 at 4.) \nParagraph 4 \u2013 Foreign Influence \nIn paragraph 4 of the SOR, the Government alleges that Applicant\u2019s wife is a citizen \nand resident of Mexico and is employed by a Mexican public safety organization.

She has a U.S. tourist visa \nthat permits her to visit Applicant at his residence in the United States. She is no longer \nemployed, but she previously worked in a small office in her city that runs a non-profit \norganization dedicated to the safety of the residents of that municipality. In that position, \nshe received local government benefits, but was not an official government employee. \nThe organization received funding from both the city and private industry. She left her job \nin or about May 2002 to care for her child. At that time, she was frustrated with her job \nbecause of the corruption of the police and politicians in her city. Her organization was \nnot effective in making changes to the law enforcement culture in the city. She is now a \nfull-time mother and studies English. The new director of her former employer continues \nto seek advice from Applicant\u2019s wife even though she is no longer employed at that \norganization. Applicant, his wife, and their child travel back and forth across the Mexican \nborder regularly. He estimated that he travels to Mexico about three times per week. He \ndoes not do any work while he is in Mexico. Applicant is helping his wife apply for \npermanent residency status in the United States. (Tr. at 49-60.) \nMitigation \nApplicant testified that he made mistakes in the past, but that he has learned from \nhis mistakes. He has changed his behavior based upon what he learned. He believes that \nhe has done well the last three years complying with all rules and policies of his employers \nand performing his job well. Applicant provided three reference letters. His current \nmanager wrote about Applicant\u2019s excellent job performance and value to his team. The \nCEO of Applicant\u2019s former employer (Company C) also praised Applicant\u2019s performance \nand professionalism. This reference noted that he hired Applicant in 2019 with full \nknowledge of Applicant\u2019s termination from Company A in 2019 and the reasons for his \ntermination. He affirmed that Applicant has learned from his past mistakes and fully \ncomplied with all security directives and policies during his work for Company C. He also \ncommented that he would hire Applicant again based upon his performance. In addition \na former supervisor wrote that Applicant was trustworthy and reliable. (Tr. at 61, 70; AE \nA; AE B; AE C.) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines (AG) list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires, \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere speculation or \nconjecture. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14, requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants national \nsecurity eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as \nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or sensitive information. \nFinally, as emphasized in Section 7 of Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under \nthis order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest \nand shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d \nSee also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information.) \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nParagraph 1 - Guideline K, Handling Protected Information \nThe security concerns about handling protected information are set forth in AG \u00b6 \n33: \nDeliberate or negligent failure to comply with rules and regulations for \nhandling protected information-which includes classified and other sensitive \ngovernment information, and proprietary information-raises doubt about an \nindividual's trustworthiness, judgment, reliability, or willingness and ability \nto safeguard such information, and is a serious security concern. \nAG \u00b6 34 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying conditions are potentially applicable: \n(b) collecting or storing protected information in any unauthorized location;  \n(g) any failure to comply with rules for the protection of classified or sensitive \ninformation; and \n(h) negligence or lax security practices that persist despite counseling by \nmanagement.  \nThe record evidence regarding Applicant\u2019s actions that lead to the termination of \nhis employment with Company A in 2019 establishes security concerns under the above \nconditions. This shifts the burden to Applicant to mitigate the concerns raised by his \nconduct. AG \u00b6 35 sets forth mitigating conditions under Guideline K. The following four \nmitigating conditions have possible application to the facts in this case: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the behavior, or it has happened so \ninfrequently or under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the individual responded favorably to counseling or remedial security \ntraining and now demonstrates a positive attitude toward the discharge of \nsecurity responsibilities;   \n(c) the security violations were due to improper or inadequate training or \nunclear instructions; and  \n(d) the violation was inadvertent, it was promptly reported, there is no \nevidence of compromise, and it does not suggest a pattern. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nNone of the above mitigating conditions fully apply. The incidents occurred just \nthree years ago and cast doubt on Applicant\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, and \ngood judgment. Applicant failed to respond to counseling and repeated the same \nmisconduct only one month later. To the extent Applicant\u2019s first violation of company \npolicy was due to his lack of awareness of the policy, his second violation a month later \nwas with full knowledge of that policy. The second violation was not inadvertent and was \nnot reported voluntarily by Applicant. Paragraph 1 is resolved against Applicant. \nParagraph 2 - Guideline M, Use of Information Technology \nThe security concerns about use of information technology are set forth in AG \u00b6 39: \nFailure to comply with rules, procedures, guidelines, or regulations \npertaining to information technology systems may raise security concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, calling into the question \nthe willingness or ability to properly protect sensitive systems, networks, \nand information. This includes any component, whether integrated into a \nlarger system or not, such as hardware, software, or firmware, used to \nenable or facilitate these operations. \nAG \u00b6 40 describes several conditions that could raise a security concern and may \nbe disqualifying. The following disqualifying conditions are potentially applicable: \n(b) unauthorized modification, destruction, or manipulation of, or denial of \naccess to, an information technology system or any data in such a system; \n(d) downloading, storing, or transmitting classified, sensitive, proprietary, or \nother protected information on or to any unauthorized information \ntechnology system; \n(e) unauthorized use of any information technology system;   \n(f) introduction, removal, or duplication of hardware, firmware, software, or \nmedia to or from any information technology system when prohibited by \nrules, procedures, guidelines, or regulations or when otherwise not \nauthorized; and  \n(g) negligence or lax security practices in handling information technology \nthat persists despite counseling by management. \nThe record evidence regarding Applicant\u2019s actions that led to the terminations of \nhis employment with Company B in 2014 and Company A in 2019 establishes security \nconcerns under the above conditions. This shifts the burden to Applicant to mitigate the \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nconcerns raised by his conduct. AG \u00b6 41 sets forth mitigating conditions under Guideline \nM. The following four mitigating conditions have possible application to the facts in this \ncase: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the behavior happened, or it happened \nunder such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and does n \ncast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the misuse was minor and done solely in the interest of organizational \nefficiency and effectiveness;  \n(c) the conduct was unintentional or inadvertent and was followed by a \nprompt, good-faith effort to correct the situation and by notification to \nappropriate personnel; and \n(d) the misuse was due to improper or inadequate training or unclear \ninstructions.   \nNone of the above mitigating conditions fully apply. Applicant\u2019s behavior in 2014 \nand 2019 reflects a pattern of misconduct, which casts doubt on his reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and good judgment. His misuse of information technology systems was \nnot minor nor were his actions done solely in the interest of organizational efficiency and \neffectiveness. Applicant\u2019s first 2014 mistake may have been unintentional, but his failure \nto self-report the error was neither inadvertent nor unintentional. His conduct in 2019 was \nknowing and intentional. Viewing the two situations together, Applicant\u2019s conduct reveals \na serious flaw regarding his unwillingness to notify appropriate personnel about his \nactions. Applicant claims that his error in 2014 was due to lack of training, but again his \nfailure to notify his managers of the problem he created is the significant security concern \nunder the facts of this case. Paragraph 2 is resolved against Applicant. \nParagraph 3 - Guideline E, Personal Conduct \nThe security concerns relating to the guideline for personal conduct are set out in \nAG \u00b6 15, which states: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nAG \u00b6 16 describes two conditions that could raise security concerns and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \naward benefits or status, determine national security eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; and  \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single guideline, \nbut which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-person \nassessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack \nof candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other \ncharacteristics indicating that the individual may not properly safeguard \nclassified or sensitive information. \nThe record evidence establishes that Applicant deliberately provided false \nanswers to two questions in his 2015 e-QIP regarding his reason for leaving Company B \nin 2014; his receipt of an official warning from Company B; and the subsequent \ntermination of his employment from Company B. His misconduct is clearly sufficient for \nan adverse determination under both Guidelines K and M to render application of AG \u00b6 \n16(c) redundant and therefore inapplicable. \nThe guideline includes two conditions in AG \u00b6 17 that could mitigate the security \nconcerns arising from Applicant\u2019s falsifications: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; and \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment. \nApplicant claims that he made a prompt good-faith disclosure of the circumstances \nof his termination from Company B in 2014 during his initial background interview in or \nabout 2016. The record does not contain a summary of that interview, so it is not possible \nto determine if his corrections of his falsifications were made before he was confronted \nby the facts of his termination. The fact that the summary is not in the record, however, is \nnot Applicant\u2019s fault since it is unclear if he knew he could request a copy of the interview \nreport. On the other hand, his deliberate misstatement of his reason for leaving Company \nB is serious and continues to cast doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, and good \njudgment. Paragraph 3 is resolved against Applicant. \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nParagraph 4 - Guideline B, Foreign Influence \nThe security concerns relating to the guideline for foreign influence are set out in \nAG \u00b6 6, which reads in pertinent part: \nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual \nhas divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by \nany foreign interest. Adjudication under this Guideline can and should \nconsider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or \nfinancial interest is located, including, but not limited to, such considerations \nas whether the foreign country is known to target United States citizens to \nobtain protected information and/or is associated with a risk of terrorism. \nAG \u00b6 7 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. I have considered all of them and the following are potentially applicable: \n(a) contact with a foreign family member, business or professional \nassociate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a foreign \ncountry if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, \ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion;  \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to \nprotect sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s desire to \nhelp a foreign person, group, or country by providing that information; and \n(e) shared living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of citizenship\nstatus, if that relationship creates a heightened risk of foreign inducement,\nmanipulation, pressure, or coercion. \n \n \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a) and 7(e) require evidence of a \u201cheightened risk.\u201d The \u201cheightened risk\u201d \nrequired to raise this disqualifying condition is a relatively low standard. \u201cHeightened risk\u201d \ndenotes a risk greater than the normal risk inherent in having a family member living under \na foreign government. The Government chose not to submit any information regarding \ncountry conditions in Mexico. The allegation appears to be largely based upon the now-\nformer employment of Applicant\u2019s wife. Accordingly, the Government has not carried its \nburden to establish that the citizenship and residency of Applicant\u2019s wife in Mexico and \nApplicant sharing living quarters with his wife creates a heightened risk of foreign \ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion.  \nOn the other hand the record evidence establishes AG \u00b6 7(b) in that Applicant\u2019s \nconnection with his wife create a potential conflict of interest between Applicant\u2019s \nobligation to protect sensitive information or technology and his desire to help his wife by \n \n \n \n11 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nproviding that information.

The following three mitigating conditions have possible application to \nthe facts in this case: \n(a) the nature of the relationship with foreign persons, the country in which \nthese persons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in \nthat country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a \nposition of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, \ngroup, organization or government and the interests of the U.S.;  \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country is \nso minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships \nand loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any \nconflict of interests in favor of the U.S. interests; and \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation. \nThe former employment of Applicant\u2019s wife makes it difficult to conclude with a \nsufficient degree of certainty that it is unlikely that Applicant will be placed in a position of \nhaving to choose between the interests of his wife and the interests of the United States. \nHis wife\u2019s continued contact with her former employer increases that risk. AG \u00b6 8(a) is not \nestablished. Applicant has such deep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in the \nU.S., that he can be expected to resolve any conflict of interests in favor of the U.S. \ninterests. Applicant has worked for U.S. defense contractors since 2015 performing \nvaluable work as an engineer. He has lived in the United States since age 26 and received \ntwo graduate degrees from U.S. universities. He has deep and longstanding relationships \nand loyalties in the United States. AG \u00b6 8(b) is established. Applicant has regular contact \nwith his wife. AG \u00b6 8(c) is not established. Paragraph 4 is resolved in favor of Applicant. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for national security eligibility by considering the totality of the \napplicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should \nconsider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \n12 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national security \neligibility for a security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon \ncareful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \npertinent facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant has not mitigated the \nsecurity concerns raised by his lax compliance with his employer\u2019s policies, his refusal to \ncomply with his employer\u2019s policies in 2019, and his deliberate falsifications in his e-QIP. \nOverall, the record evidence creates questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s present \nsuitability for national security eligibility and a security clearance. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline K: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a and 1.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline M:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a though 2.c: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 3, Guideline E:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 3.a and 3.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 3.c: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 4, Guideline B: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \nFor Applicant \n13 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n     \n                                           \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s national \nsecurity eligibility for a security clearance.

Although \nhe has worked in the same position, his federal contactor employer has changed. He \ncompleted a security clearance application in March 2020, and did not disclose any \ndisqualifying information. The ensuing investigation revealed that he owed $45,458 in \ndelinquent debt. (GE 3 - 5) \nApplicant served in the U.S. Army from February 2003 to June 2010. While he \nwas stationed in Germany, he met his wife, a German citizen, whom he married in May \n2007. After his separation from the U.S. Army, he remained in Germany. Although he \ntook college classes between 2011 and 2017, he did not earn a degree. Professionally, \nApplicant worked part time as a civilian employee. In October 2016, he decided to \nreturn to the United States, living and working for one year before returning to Germany. \n(GE 3) \nIn July 2017, Applicant began working on a U.S. military installation. It is unclear \nif he did so as a civilian employee or as a federal contractor employee. He left the \nposition in November 2019, after accepting his current position. (GE 3) \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant is indebted to 14 creditors for $45,458 in \ndelinquent debt. The majority of that amount, 63%, is for four delinquent student loans \ntotaling $28,813 (SOR \u00b6\u00b61.a \u2013 1.d). The next largest delinquent debt, SOR \u00b6 1.o, is the \ndeficiency balance on a car repossession for $7,021, followed by a delinquent debt to \nanother government agency for $2,622 (SOR \u00b6 1.p). The remaining debts are consumer \naccounts. \nApplicant admits owing the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a \u2013 1.h and 1.j \u2013 1.n. He \nhas contacted the creditors alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f and 1.h and inquired about how to \nreturn the accounts to good standing. He admits owing a deficiency balance on the car \nrepossession in SOR \u00b6 1.o, but disagrees with the SOR allegation as to the amount \nowed. He denies the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.i and 1.r, because he does not know \ntheir origins. He denies SOR \u00b6 1.q claiming that it is a duplicate of SOR \u00b6 1.m. He does \nnot provide any answer or explanation for SOR \u00b6 1.p, the delinquent debt owed to the \nother government agency. (GE 1-2) \nApplicant blames his financial problems on earning insufficient income after \nseparating from the Army in June 2010. Currently, he and his wife earn enough money \nto pay their recurring bills.

These guidelines are not \ninflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, \nadministrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 \ndescribing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative \ngoal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-\nperson concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nusing a debt consolidation loan to address the other debts.

AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance \ndecision. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nFinancial Considerations \nUnresolved delinquent debt is a serious security concern because failure to \n\u201csatisfy debts [or] meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of \njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified \nor sensitive information.\u201d (AG \u00b6 18). The SOR alleges that Applicant owes over $45,458 \nto 14 creditors on 18 delinquent accounts. Applicant\u2019s admissions and the credit reports \nin the record, GE 4 and 5, establish the Government\u2019s prima facie case. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nThe following disqualifying conditions apply: \nAG \u00b6 19(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \nAG \u00b6 19(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nAll the debts remain unresolved.

He has not provided a legitimate \nbasis for disputing the debts he denies, or evidence of a good-faith effort to resolve \nthose he admits. None of the financial considerations mitigating conditions apply. \nBased on the record, doubts remain about Applicant\u2019s suitability for access to \nclassified information.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is 48 years old. He is divorced with four adult children. He has a high school diploma and about a year and a half of college. He holds the position of Account Manager. He is seeking to obtain a security clearance in connection with his employment. Guideline F - Financial Considerations The Government alleged that Applicant is ineligible for a clearance because he made financial decisions that indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which raise questions about his reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. The SOR alleged that Applicant is indebted to six creditors for delinquent accounts that were either charged off or placed for collection totaling approximately $50,000. In his answer, Applicant admits each of the allegations set forth in the SOR. Credit reports of the Applicant dated November 17, 2020; April 29, 2021; March 3, 2022; and July 18, 2022, confirm that he was once indebted to each of the creditors listed in the SOR. (Government Exhibits 3, 4, 5 and 6.) Applicant began working for his current employer in February 2018. This is his first time applying for a security clearance.

On December 7, 2021, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications \nFacility (DoD CAF) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR), detailing security \nconcerns under Guideline F, Financial Considerations. The action was taken under \nExecutive Order 10865 (EO), Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \n(February 20, 1960), as amended; DoD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and \nthe National Security Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to \nClassified Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AG), effective within the \nDoD after June 8, 2017. \nApplicant answered the SOR on February 9, 2022, and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on May 11, 2022. The \nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals issued a notice of hearing on that same day, \nand the hearing was convened as scheduled on July 19, 2022.

Applicant \ntestified on his own behalf. Following the hearing, in an effort to clarify the documents \nhe submitted at the hearing, Applicant submitted a packet of documents, referred to as \nApplicant\u2019s Post-Hearing Exhibit A, which was admitted into evidence without objection. \nDOHA received the final transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on July 29, 2022. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is 48 years old. He is divorced with four adult children. He has a high \nschool diploma and about a year and a half of college. He holds the position of Account \nManager. \nHe is seeking to obtain a security clearance in connection with his \nemployment. \nGuideline F - Financial Considerations \nThe Government alleged that Applicant is ineligible for a clearance because he \nmade financial decisions that indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which raise questions about his \nreliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant is indebted to six creditors for delinquent \naccounts that were either charged off or placed for collection totaling approximately \n$50,000. In his answer, Applicant admits each of the allegations set forth in the SOR. \nCredit reports of the Applicant dated November 17, 2020; April 29, 2021; March 3, \n2022; and July 18, 2022, confirm that he was once indebted to each of the creditors \nlisted in the SOR. (Government Exhibits 3, 4, 5 and 6.) Applicant began working for his \ncurrent employer in February 2018. \nThis is his first time applying for a security \nclearance. \nApplicant explained that his financial problems started as a result of his \ncompensation package changing, which significantly reduced his income. Applicant \nexplained that at his previous place of employment, he held a sales job and was given \nan on-target earnings package of $120,000. For three years, from 2015 through 2017, \nhe over achieved and earned about $180,000 annually, much more than his target \nearnings. Because he was earning too much, his company restructured his competitive \nplan, and for two years he was not earning even the on-target earnings. He believes he \nmade about $100,000 those two years. As a result, he fell behind on many of his bills.  \nHe stated that he managed to keep up with the credit accounts that he had open, \nincluding his children\u2019s school tuition and his student loan. \nAfter leaving his previous employer, Applicant liquidated his 401k and borrowed \nbetween $50,000 and $75,000 to keep his family afloat while he built his \u201csales pipeline\u201d \nat his new job. With his current employer, Applicant stated that his compensation \npackage has allowed him to pay back his delinquencies and satisfy his past due debts. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n(Tr. p. 48.) Applicant explained that he consolidated his debts and paid them off. (Tr. p. \n48.) Applicant also stated that the last two years, 2020 and 2021, he has built up his \n\u201csales pipeline\u201d and earned close to $350,000 annually. (Tr. pp. 55, 56, and 61.) He \nhas also been able to build up some savings. Applicant stated that he has only three \nrevolving credit cards and pays cash for everything else. He and his fianc\u00e9 are planning \nto purchase a house next year.  \nApplicant explained that after taxes he now brings home about $2,100 every two \nweeks. \nHe also receives periodic commission checks based upon his sales. \nHe \ntestified that he is expecting a commission check soon for about $26,000. Without \ntouching his commission check, after paying his regular monthly expenses, such as \nrent, gas, food, and electricity, he is still \u201cin the black\u201d every month. (Tr. p. 51.) In \nsavings, he currently has about $100,000 in his 401K. He states that he always files his \nannual income tax returns in a timely fashion. Applicant earns sufficient monies to be \nable to resolve all of his delinquent debts. \nThe following delinquent debts listed in the SOR are of security concern: \n1.a. Applicant was indebted to a creditor for an account that was placed for \ncollection in the approximate amount of $7,138. Applicant contacted the creditor and \nsettled the debt on December 21, 2021, for $4,289. (Tr. p. 59, and Applicant\u2019s Exhibit \nJ.) The debt is no longer owing. \n1.b. Applicant was indebted to a resort for an account that was charged off in the \napproximate amount of $3,500. This was for a timeshare that Applicant purchased. \nApplicant was issued a 1099-C (Cancellation of Debt) for tax year 2018, and the amount \nof the debt discharged was $3,376. (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit H.) The debt is no longer \nowing. \n1.c. Applicant was indebted to a bank for an account that was charged off in the \napproximate amount of $2,489.  Applicant submitted a receipt showing that the account \nwas agreed to be settled on October 20, 2021.  On October 19, 2021, Applicant made a \npayment of $1,000 to the creditor.  A second payment was made on October 29, 2021, \nin the amount of $1,489.37.  The remaining balance owed is $181.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit \nG.) \n1.d. Applicant is indebted to a creditor for an account that was charged off in the \napproximate amount of $16,235. Applicant stated that this is a delinquent credit card \ndebt. Applicant\u2019s credit report dated July 2022 shows that the debt was charged off. \n(Applicant\u2019s Post-Hearing Exhibit A.) \nApplicant has not paid the debt. \nThe debt \nremains owing. \n1.e. Applicant is indebted to a creditor for an account that was charged off in the \napproximate amount of $13,814. Applicant stated that this was a delinquent credit card \ndebt. Applicant stated that he hired an attorney on January 20, 2020, to assist with \nsettling the debt. (Applicant\u2019s Post-Hearing Exhibit A.)

There is no evidence to show whether Applicant paid the debt or whether he \nallowed it to fall off his credit report.  The debt remains owing. \n1.f. Applicant is indebted to a creditor for an account that was charged off in the \napproximate amount of $7,000. Applicant contends that this is the same debt as the \none set forth in paragraph 1.a. As mentioned above, the debt was settled for $4,289, on \nDecember 21, 2021. (Applicant\u2019s Post-Hearing Exhibit A.) The debt is no longer owing. \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance \ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to \npotential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F -  Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for Financial Considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. Two are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nThrough no fault of his own, Applicant experienced financial hardship when his \nemployment compensation plan changed with little notice, and he was suddenly not \nearning sufficient monies to support the lifestyle he had become accustomed to. As a \nresult, he fell behind on his financial obligations. The evidence is sufficient to raise the \nabove disqualifying conditions. \nThe following mitigating conditions under the Financial Considerations guideline \nare potentially applicable under AG \u00b6 20. \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g. loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce, or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;\nand  \n \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.  \nApplicant is now working for another employer and earning substantially more \nmoney than he previously did. He states that he had resolved all of the delinquent \ndebts in the SOR. (Tr. p. 48.) However, he has not presented evidence to show that he \nhas resolved the two largest debts which are of most concern. Applicant still owes two \nseparate creditors a total of approximately $29,000. Applicant testified at the hearing \nthat the two largest debts, namely the debts set forth in 1.d., and 1.e., were credit cards \ndebts that he consolidated, liquidated his 401k, and paid off. (Tr. pp. 57 through 60.) \nThere is no evidence in the record to show this. In his Post-Hearing Exhibit A, Applicant \nstated the debt in 1.d. was charged off, which means that he still owes the debt. In \nregard to the debt in 1.e., he stated that he retained an attorney on January 20, 2020, to \nassist him in settling the debt, but provided nothing more to show that he has paid the \ndebt or allowed it to fall off of his record. Without more, it can only be assumed that he \nallowed it to fall off of his credit report, which does not show responsible behavior.  \nSince Applicant is now earning about $350,000 annually, it is incomprehensible as to \nwhy he did not pay or otherwise resolve these larger debts. \nApplicant has not \ndemonstrated sufficient responsibility, good judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness, to \nbe granted access to classified information. Mitigating conditions 20(a), 20(b), and \n20(d) do not establish full mitigation here. \nThere is insufficient evidence in the record to show that Applicant\u2019s delinquent \ndebts have been or are being resolved. There is insufficient evidence in the record to \nshow that the Applicant has carried his burden of proof to establish mitigation of the \ngovernment security concerns under Guideline F. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\n \n \n \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Applicant must resolve \nthe largest of his delinquent debts and remain financially responsibility in the future to \nbe eligible for access to classified information. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nrelevant facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I conclude Applicant has not \nmitigated the Financial Considerations security concern. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a., 1.b., 1.c., and 1.f. \nFor Applicant \nSuparagraphs 1.d. and 1.e. \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for \na security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nDarlene Lokey Anderson \nAdministrative Judge \n7 \n",

The case was assigned to me on May 5, \n2022. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant admitted both of the SOR allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b with explanations. \nAfter a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the \nfollowing findings of fact. \nApplicant is 61 years old. He served in the armed forces from 1983 to 1995 and \nreceived an honorable discharge. He married in 1988 and has two adult children. He \nearned a bachelor\u2019s degree in 1983 and a master\u2019s degree in 2001. He has been \nemployed by a federal contractor since December 2019. \nApplicant disclosed in his October 2019 security clearance application (SCA) that \nhe was unemployed from January 2014 until September 2019. He also disclosed that he \nhad not filed federal or state income tax returns for tax years 2015 through 2018, and \nexplained that he had no income during those years due to his unemployment, and \ntherefore was not required to file. During his December 2019 background investigation \nwith a government investigator, he stated that he checked the Internal Revenue Service \n(IRS) and his state\u2019s Department of Taxation (DOT) websites for the subject tax years \nand confirmed his income fell below the required filing threshold. (Items 4, 5) \nIn December 2019 Applicant received a notice from his state\u2019s DOT that he owed \n$6,316 for tax year 2016. Applicant told the investigator that he intended to dispute the \namount owed, but he would pay the balance if it was determined to be correct. In January \n2020, Applicant paid the DOT $6,350. In his Answer to the SOR, he stated that he \nresolved his state tax issue and will continue to work with the DOT to resolve any \noutstanding issues. He said he had not received any income in his state for the other tax \nyears alleged. To address the possibility that he owed federal taxes, he submitted a \npayment to the IRS for $2,500 in mid-December 2019. In his Answer to the SOR, he said \nhe sent the IRS another $1,200 to cover any estimated penalties. (Items 3, 5, 6) \nApplicant answered Government interrogatories in January 2021. The \nInterrogatories specifically requested that Applicant provide copies of his 2015 to 2018 \nIRS tax transcripts so it could verify the status of his filings and verify if he did not need \nto file for those years. He stated that he had not received the documents in time, so did \nnot provide them with his Answer. (Item 6) \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant stated that he has inquired of the IRS about \nthe status of any balance he owed or refund he was due for tax years 2015 through 2018. \nAt that time, he said he had not yet received a response. He said he intended to continue \nto work with the IRS and DOT to resolve any tax matters.

(Item 3) \nApplicant told the government investigator that his wife worked during the tax years \nin question, but did not earn enough income to require filing. While unemployed, he lived \noff of his savings and investments. He said he ensured he had the required tax withheld \nfrom his distributions. In his SOR answer, he said that he always prepaid any taxes owed \nwhen he redeemed his investments. (Items 3, 5) \nDistributions of investments are included in a taxpayer\u2019s gross income from all \nsources, which are the basis for federal and state income tax return filing requirements. \nApplicant did not provide a copy of his tax transcripts for any of the tax years in question \nthat might show he was not required to file for each of the tax years. (Item 3, 5) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set out \nin AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handing and safeguarding classified \ninformation. See ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nAG \u00b6 19 provides conditions that could raise security concerns. The following is \npotentially applicable: \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income tax \nreturns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as required. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                          \n \n  \nApplicant disclosed in his 2019 SCA that he had failed to file his 2015 through 2018 \nfederal and state tax returns. He reiterated his admissions during his background \ninterview. There is sufficient evidence to support the application of the above disqualifying \ncondition. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements.  \nApplicant admitted he failed to file his 2015 through 2018 federal and state income \ntax returns. He asserted that he did not believe he was required to file during these years \nbecause his income level was below the minimum income amount. He received a tax bill \nfrom his state\u2019s DOT indicating he owed taxes for tax year 2016. The amount he owed, \n$6,350, suggests that the amount of income to produce such a tax liability easily exceeds \nthe IRS threshold of $20,700 for that tax year. This should have raised a red flag to him \nthat perhaps he was required to file during the years he was unemployed. His wife was \nworking and he was receiving distributions from his investments, which are included in \nthe calculations of a taxpayer\u2019s gross income from all sources, which amounts form the \nbasis for federal and state income tax returns filing requirements. It is possible that \nApplicant and his wife\u2019s joint income in subject tax years did not meet the IRS\u2019 threshold \nfor required filing. Applicant has repeatedly had the opportunity to provide the requested \nIRS tax transcripts and other documentary evidence in his SOR Answer, response to the \ngovernment interrogatories, and as specifically requested in the FORM, but he has failed \nto provide the evidence to support his position.1  The above mitigating conditions do not \napply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \n1 www.irs.gov \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. \nNo documentary evidence was presented to confirm Applicant\u2019s assertion that he \nwas not required to file federal or state income tax returns for tax years 2015 through \n2016. Failure to comply with tax laws suggests that an applicant has a problem with \nabiding by well-established government rules and systems. Voluntary compliance with \nrules and systems is essential for protecting classified information. See, e.g., ISCR Case \nNo. 16-01726 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 28, 2018). A person who fails repeatedly to fulfill his or \nher legal obligations, such as paying taxes when due, does not demonstrate the high \ndegree of good judgment and reliability required of those granted access to classified \ninformation. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-01382 at 4 (App. Bd. May 16, 2018). \nApplicant failed to meet his burden of persuasion. The record evidence leaves me \nwith questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security \nclearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security \nconcerns raised under Guideline F, financial considerations. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.b: \nAgainst Applicant \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nCarol G. Ricciardello \nAdministrative Judge \n7 \n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant admitted the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.j, and 1.l. He denied the SOR allegation in \u00b6 1.k. His admissions are adopted as findings of fact. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, testimony, and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant is 38 years old. He immigrated to the United States in 2001 and is a naturalized citizen. He enlisted in the military in 2001 and was medically discharged with an honorable discharge in 2006. He earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2010 and a master\u2019s degree in business in 2015. He married in 2011 and has three small children. He has worked for a federal contractor since 2019. (Tr. 32-35) The SOR alleges 10 delinquent credit cards and loans totaling approximately $53,735. He cosigned for his wife\u2019s student loan which is in default status. The last payment was in November 2017. (SOR \u00b6 1.a-$24,395). His mortgage was past due in the amount of approximately $71,887 (SOR \u00b6 1.k). These debts are corroborated by Applicant\u2019s admissions in his security clearance application (SCA), background interview, government interrogatories, and credit reports from August 2019, January 2020, February 2021, and March 2022.

Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn June 25, 2021, the Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency issued \nto Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under Guideline \nF, financial considerations. The action was taken under Executive Order (EO) 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDepartment of Defense (DOD) Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) effective on June 8, 2017. \nApplicant answered the SOR and requested a hearing before an administrative \njudge. The case was assigned to me on February 18, 2022. The Defense Office of \nHearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing on March 15, 2022, scheduling \nthe hearing for April 6, 2022, by Microsoft Teams. The hearing was held as scheduled. \n1 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe Government offered exhibits (GE) 1 through 8. Applicant testified and did not offer \nany documentary evidence. He did not object to the Government\u2019s exhibits and they were \nadmitted into evidence. The record remained opened until April 20, 2022, to permit \nApplicant to provide evidence. Applicant was confused about the date the record closed \nand provided documents after the date the record closed. He offered Applicant Exhibits \n(AE) A through H. There were no objections to the late submissions or any of the exhibits \nand all were admitted into evidence. DOHA received the hearing transcript on April 18, \n2022. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant admitted the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.j, and 1.l. He denied \nthe SOR allegation in \u00b6 1.k. His admissions are adopted as findings of fact. After a \nthorough and careful review of the pleadings, testimony, and exhibits submitted, I make \nthe following findings of fact. \nApplicant is 38 years old. He immigrated to the United States in 2001 and is a \nnaturalized citizen. He enlisted in the military in 2001 and was medically discharged with \nan honorable discharge in 2006. He earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2010 and a master\u2019s \ndegree in business in 2015. He married in 2011 and has three small children. He has \nworked for a federal contractor since 2019. (Tr. 32-35) \nThe SOR alleges 10 delinquent credit cards and loans totaling approximately \n$53,735. He cosigned for his wife\u2019s student loan which is in default status. The last \npayment was in November 2017. (SOR \u00b6 1.a-$24,395). His mortgage was past due in the \namount of approximately $71,887 (SOR \u00b6 1.k). These debts are corroborated by \nApplicant\u2019s admissions in his security clearance application (SCA), background interview, \ngovernment interrogatories, and credit reports from August 2019, January 2020, February \n2021, and March 2022. (Tr. 72-74; GE 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7) \nApplicant testified that he worked in industry and progressed in his career moving \nup from a technician to a program manager, increasing his salary and responsibility along \nthe way. He wanted to own his own business and saw a business opportunity. He left his \njob in approximately July 2017 and became the director of operations in a start-up \nbusiness that he believed had excellent potential. He stated that when he left his stable \njob he was making six figures and had medical benefits. He said he did not worry about \nhis credit and not paying bills because entrepreneurship is about taking risks and \ngambling. He understood the risks. (Tr. 37; GE 1) \nApplicant grew the company and was paid for about 8 to 10 months as was his \nmedical insurance, but the business began to have money issues. He agreed to become \nan independent contractor employee (1099) to help with the cash flow issues. The \nbusiness started having more problems, and Applicant was not being paid or was \nreceiving partial payments or late payments. He started missing payments on his \nmortgage and his other accounts. He paid for the necessities. He explained that a lot of \npromises were made by the owner of the business to him, but he attributed it to the \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \nentrepreneurial goal of the business. None of the promises were in writing. The business \nstopped paying his health insurance and his wife was pregnant with medical issues. \nApplicant became inundated with delinquent accounts. He stated that he is owed money \nfrom the business, but the matter is in litigation. He estimated he is owed about $70,000-\n$80,000. The owner promised when they win the case Applicant will be paid. The litigation \nhas been ongoing for about three years. He left the business and he was unemployed for \nseveral months. He accepted a job in June 2019 that was an hour drive from his home. \nHis starting salary was about $100,000. He was promoted and his current salary is about \n$135,000. Applicant also receives $1,882 monthly in disability benefits from Department \nof Veterans Affairs (VA). (Tr. 35-45, 67, 69-71) \nApplicant explained that his first goal was to make sure his house was not \nforeclosed. He was able to obtain a loan modification for his mortgage (SOR \u00b6 1.k), which \nis now current. He provided the supporting documents. (Tr. 46; SOR Answer) \nApplicant testified that his wife does not work outside the home and he is the only \none earning an income. He began contacting creditors to reach settlements. He \nnegotiated a settlement with the creditor in SOR \u00b6 1.d, which was approved in August \n2021 (balance owed $7,434) to pay $2,230 over 18 months. He provided documentary \nproof that he has made the requirement monthly payments since then. (Tr. 47-50, 68; GE \n7; AE B, G, H). \nApplicant reached a settlement agreement with the creditor in SOR \u00b6 1.c ($11,570) \nto pay $5,785. He provided proof that he has made six monthly payments from November \n2021 to March 2022. (Tr. 53-59, 74; AE F) \nApplicant also provided proof that he has been making payments on another debt \nsince October 2021. He provided documents to substantiate the payments. The creditor \nlisted on his documents is not a collection agency and it is not one of the creditors alleged \nin the SOR. (AE A, C, D) \nAt his hearing, Applicant stated he had no other payment agreements with the \nremaining creditors alleged in the SOR. Applicant\u2019s wife has credit cards that are also \ndelinquent. They deliberately stopped making payments on the credit cards so the \ncreditors would agree to negotiate settlements. (Tr. 79-84; GE 7) \nIn February 2022, Applicant started a side business so he could increase his \nincome. It is a delivery service for a major company. He estimated that after paying \nexpenses, he has made about $2,500 since February. He has consulted a credit \ncounseling company, but did not hire it. He said he has told his creditors that he is paying \nwhat he can afford. He said he stopped paying some credit cards because the creditors \nwould not negotiate a settlement unless he defaulted. He obtained a $15,000 secured \nloan in August 2021, so he could repay his mother and brother money they had lent him. \nApplicant estimated he borrowed about $5,000 each from his mother and brother. He has \npaid them back. Prior to the COVID pandemic, Applicant was paying his student loans. \nUnder the CARES Act the loans are deferred. He owes about $79,000. He will seek an \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nincome-based payment plan when his student loans are no longer deferred. (Tr. 61-65, \n75-79, 85, 87-89) \nIn the past, Applicant played in poker tournaments at casinos to relax. The entry \nfees can be as high as $550. Sometimes his coworkers would give him the entry money. \nIn 2018, he played a couple of tournaments and finished high enough in one to claim \nabout $11,000 in prize money. A couple of days later he had another big win. He stated \nthat in the past he has won more than he wagered. He said he would use his winnings to \ncelebrate by taking his family out for dinner and purchase items. He said he paid some \ndebts. Due to the pandemic he stopped going to the casino to play. He also said it is time \nconsuming and takes him away from his family. His last tournament was in 2019. He said \nthe most he has lost in one day was $2,000. (Tr. 99-105; GE 6) \nApplicant does not have money saved in a pension plan or Individual Retirement \nAccount. He filed his 2020 federal tax return and owes about $2,000 due to an error made \nin the return. He has not paid this tax debt. He believes he will be entitled to a refund on \nhis 2021 taxes, and it will be applied to the balance he owes. He stated that the IRS \nclaims he owes $7,000, but he believes it is an error that will be corrected. Applicant does \nnot keep a budget, but intends to start one in the future. (Tr. 106-114) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility, the administrative judge \nmust consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, \nthe adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating \nconditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \n4 \n\n \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set out \nin AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThe Appeal Board explained the scope and rationale for the financial \nconsiderations security concern in ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) \n(citation omitted) as follows: \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might \nknowingly compromise classified information in order to raise money in \nsatisfaction of his or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the \n5 \n\n \ntotality of an applicant\u2019s financial history and circumstances. The Judge \nmust consider pertinent evidence regarding the applicant\u2019s self-control, \njudgment, and other qualities essential to protecting the national secrets as \nwell as the vulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive \npresumes a nexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines \nand an applicant\u2019s security eligibility. \nAG \u00b6 19 provides conditions that could raise security concerns. The following are \npotentially applicable: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant has numerous credit cards, personal loans, and a student loan that are \ndelinquent or in collection. There is sufficient evidence to support the application of the \nabove disqualifying conditions. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant has numerous delinquent credit cards, loans, and a student loan that are \nnot resolved. His debts are ongoing and recent. Applicant attributes his financial problems \nto a decision he made to leave a stable job and take a risk working in a new business that \nhad the potential for substantial rewards. He took the risk. He did not receive a salary for \na period and promises were made to him about being compensated. Perhaps that part of \nthe equation was not anticipated, but he knew it was risky, and willingly gambled and lost. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \nThis was his choice and not beyond his control. He addressed his mortgage debt because \nhe was worried about foreclosure and having a home for his family. He has settlement \nagreements on three debts (one not alleged), but none of the other debts are resolved. \nAG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply. There is insufficient evidence for the full application of AG \u00b6 \n20(b). \nApplicant did not provide sufficient evidence that he has participated in financial \ncounseling or that there are clear indications his financial problems are under control. AG \n\u00b6 20(c) does not apply. Applicant was able to obtain a loan modification to keep his house \nfrom foreclosure, and he is current on the payments. SOR \u00b6 1.k is resolved. He recently \nnegotiated settlement agreements with two creditors for the debts alleged in the SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.c and 1.d. AG \u00b6 20(d) applies to those debts. There is no evidence that he has payment \nplans or resolved the other delinquent accounts or the student loan alleged in the SOR. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent \nto which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the \nmotivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, \nexploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \nApplicant took a financial risk realizing if it worked out he would reap a significant \nreward. It did not, and he has numerous debts that remain delinquent. He has payment \nplans for three debts (one that is not on the SOR), but he has numerous credit cards, \nloans, and a student loan that have not been resolved. He has not met his burden of \npersuasion. The record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s \n7 \n\n \n_____________________________ \neligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For these reasons, I conclude Applicant \nfailed to mitigate the security concerns arising under Guideline F, financial considerations. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs -1.c-1.d: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.e-1.j: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.k: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.l: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nCarol G. Ricciardello \nAdministrative Judge \n8 \n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is a 59-year-old packaging engineer for a Government contractor, employed since 1984. He earned an associate\u2019s degree in 2016. He married in 1993 and divorced nine months later. He remarried in 2001, and has one adult child. He has held security clearances since 1985. The SOR alleges under Guideline F that Applicant has seven delinquent debts including loans and credit card accounts, totaling about $42,971 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a to 1.g); three Federal student loans in collections, totaling about $1,908 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.h to 1.j); and three medical debts in collections, totaling $238 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.k-1.m). Applicant admitted all of the debts except for the student loans, claiming the IRS captured his refunds and applied them to his debts. The evidence submitted by the Government supports all of the SOR allegations. SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a to 1.g and 1.k to 1.m are bank loans, credit card accounts, and medical debts that have been charged off or are in collections. Applicant admitted the debts and testified that he has not taken action to resolve them. He stated that he became overextended on loans and credit while supporting his daughter, who suffered from alcoholism and homelessness, and her two children. His debts occurred largely between 2015 and 2016, where he used one account to pay on other accounts. He argues that he has not accumulated new debt since 2018 or 2019, but he has no payment plans nor has he made payments toward his delinquent accounts. SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.h to 1.j are student ",

The evidence submitted by the Government supports all of the \nSOR allegations. \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a to 1.g and 1.k to 1.m are bank loans, credit card accounts, and medical \ndebts that have been charged off or are in collections. Applicant admitted the debts and \ntestified that he has not taken action to resolve them. He stated that he became \noverextended on loans and credit while supporting his daughter, who suffered from \nalcoholism and homelessness, and her two children. His debts occurred largely between \n2015 and 2016, where he used one account to pay on other accounts. He argues that he \nhas not accumulated new debt since 2018 or 2019, but he has no payment plans nor has \nhe made payments toward his delinquent accounts. \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.h to 1.j are student loans in collections. He testified that the IRS has \nrecaptured $2,616 and applied it to his student loans, and he had a garnishment order \nfrom March 2018 to April 2019. When he answered the SOR, he believed the loans were \npaid, but after inquiring with the Department of Education after his hearing, he discovered \nthat he still owed $1,909. He initiated a payment plan and made one payment of $59.21 \non October 26, 2022. \nApplicant testified that he currently cannot afford to pay any debts and he had not \ncontacted any creditors. He began working with a credit repair service in February or \nMarch 2022, and opened a secured credit card. He hopes to improve his credit rating. He \nlives paycheck-to-paycheck, does not have a budget, and has not had financial \ncounseling. He has about $1,350 in cash, a 401k retirement fund, and claims to have \nabout $500 to $600 in net monthly remainder after paying expenses. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nPolicies \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nNational security eligibility is predicated upon the applicant meeting the criteria \ncontained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. \nInstead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies \nthese guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider a person\u2019s stability, trustworthiness, reliability, \ndiscretion, character, honesty, and judgment. AG \u00b6 1(b). \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \u201cSubstantial \nevidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. Washington \nMetro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines presume a \nnexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria listed \ntherein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 12-01295 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Jan. 20, 2015). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts.

The \nguideline encompasses concerns about a person\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other \nqualities essential to protecting classified information. A person who is financially \nirresponsible may also be irresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and \nsafeguarding classified information. See ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, \n2012). \nApplicant incurred debts while caring for his adult daughter needing special \nattention, and his grandchildren. His debts began to accumulate in about 2015, but he \nsaid that he has not accumulated new debts since about 2018. This was an unplanned \nlife event, but Applicant has not acted responsibly toward his financial obligations under \nthe circumstances. As of the date of the hearing, he had done nothing to address his \ndelinquent debts. When he answered the SOR, he believed his student loans were paid \nvia garnishment or IRS recapture of his tax refunds, but learned differently after the \nhearing. He contacted the Department of Education, and made his first payment toward \nresolving his student loan debts. He is credited for working to resolve the student loans. \nThe remaining debts remain unresolved. \nA debt that became delinquent several years ago is still considered recent because \n\u201can applicant\u2019s ongoing, unpaid debts evidence a continuing course of conduct and, \ntherefore, can be viewed as recent for purposes of the Guideline F mitigating conditions.\u201d \n(ISCR Case No. 15-06532 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 16, 2017) (citing ISCR Case No. 15-01690 \nat 2 (App. Bd. Sept. 13, 2016)). \nApplicant presented no documentary evidence of substantive financial counseling \nto assist him with meeting financial obligations or budgeting. His failure to address his \ndelinquent accounts puts into question his reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. \nAlthough Applicant\u2019s current financial position may have improved since 2018, he has \ndone very little to address his debts despite a long work history. Except for the student \nloans being resolved, mitigating conditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a) - 20(e) do not apply to the \nremaining debts. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6\u00b6 2(a), 2(c), and 2(d), the ultimate determination of whether to grant \nnational security eligibility must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Under the whole-person \nconcept, the administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n_______________________ \nclearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d). \nI considered all of the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my findings of fact \nand comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. I also considered \nApplicant\u2019s life circumstances, however, I remain unconvinced of his overall financial \nresponsibility, efforts to resolve delinquent debts, and his ability, intent, and desire to meet \nhis financial obligations in the future. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with question and doubts about Applicant\u2019s \neligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude \nApplicant has not mitigated the financial considerations security concerns. I considered \nthe exceptions under Security Executive Agent Directive (SEAD) 4, Appendix C, dated \nJune 8, 2017, and determined they are not applicable in this case. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.g; 1.k \u2013 1.m: \nAgainst Applicant \nFor Applicant \n Subparagraphs 1.h \u2013 1.j: \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interest of the \nUnited States to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.

(Exhibit 6) He stated that \nhis marijuana usage was rare, estimated at two to three times annually, and he used \nmarijuana as a sleep aid. He explained that as a resident of a certain state, he \npurchased marijuana from a dispensary under state law. Before that, he obtained \nmarijuana from a friend that he no longer associates with. He stated that he used \nmarijuana to help him sleep and for relaxation even while having a security clearance \nbecause he found traditional sleep aids ineffective. He no longer associates with people \nwith whom he used marijuana in the past. And he stated there is no likelihood of \nrecurrence because he did not intend to use marijuana in the future. \nIn his answer to the SOR, Applicant emphasized the infrequency of his marijuana \nuse and that his primary use of marijuana was as a sleep aid. He stated that he decided \nto quit using marijuana in September 2020 to promote a healthy lifestyle for himself and \nhis family. He stated he is focused on doing what is right for his family and his career. In \nhis job or role as a financial analyst, he denied having access to classified information \nwhen he used or purchased marijuana between February 2020 and September 2020. \nIn his reply to the FORM, Applicant repeated the main themes from his answer. \nHe also provided more detail about actions taken in quitting marijuana. He stated that \nhe eliminated his seldom marijuana use as a sleep aid by adapting his daily routine to \ninclude regular exercise and a reformed diet. He also incorporates other activities, such \nas reading and meditation, which allow him to relax before going to bed. As a result, he \nstated that he has seen an overall improvement to his mental and physical state. He \nfurther stated that his family is his biggest inspiration, and he appreciates the \nimportance of being a role model and leading by example for his children. He explained \nthat the positive changes in his personal life have flowed through to his employment, \nwhere he has excelled and received a promotion. In conclusion, he provided a signed \nstatement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement and substance misuse, and he \nacknowledged that any future involvement or misuse would be grounds for revocation of \nnational security eligibility. \nLaw and Policies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (E.O.) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of \nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the National Security \nAdjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or \nEligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AG), effective June 8, 2017. \nIt is well-established law that no one has a right to a security clearance.1 As \nnoted by the Supreme Court in Department of the Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe clearly consistent \nstandard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the \n1 Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988) (\u201cit should be obvious that no one has a \n\u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance\u201d); Duane v.

In Egan, the \nSupreme Court stated that the burden of proof is less than a preponderance of \nevidence.3 The Appeal Board has followed the Court\u2019s reasoning, and a judge\u2019s findings \nof fact are reviewed under the substantial-evidence standard.4 \nThere is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for \naccess to classified information.5 The Government has the burden of presenting \nevidence to establish facts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted.6 An \nApplicant is responsible for presenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts that have been admitted or proven.7 In addition, an applicant has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.8 \nDiscussion \nUnder Guideline H for drug involvement and substance misuse, the concern as \nset forth in AG \u00b6 24 is that: \n[t]he illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescriptions and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose, can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. . . .  \nIn addition to the above matters, I note that the Director of National Intelligence \n(DNI), acting in his capacity as the Security Executive Agent (SecEA), issued an \nOctober 25, 2014 memorandum concerning adherence to federal laws prohibiting \nmarijuana use. In doing so, the DNI emphasized three things. First, no state can \nauthorize violations of federal law, including violations of the Controlled Substances Act, \nwhich identifies marijuana as a Schedule I controlled drug. Second, changes to state \nlaws (and the laws of the District of Columbia) concerning marijuana use do not alter the \n2 484 U.S. at 531. \n3 484 U.S. at 531. \n4 ISCR Case No. 01-20700 (App. Bd.

And third, a person\u2019s disregard of federal law \nconcerning the use, sale, or manufacture of marijuana remains relevant when making \neligibility decisions for sensitive national security positions. \nThe DNI recently updated or clarified guidance for marijuana-related issues in \nsecurity clearance adjudications via a December 21, 2021 memorandum, which states \nin pertinent part the following: \n[Federal] agencies are instructed that prior recreational marijuana \nuse by an individual may be relevant to adjudications but not \ndeterminative. The SecEA has provided direction in [the adjudicative \nguidelines] to agencies that requires them to use a \"whole-person \nconcept.\" This requires adjudicators to carefully weigh a number of \nvariables in an individual's life to determine whether that individual's \nbehavior raises a security concern, if at all, and whether that concern has \nbeen mitigated such that the individual may now receive a favorable \nadjudicative determination. Relevant mitigations include, but are not \nlimited to, frequency of use and whether the individual can demonstrate \nthat future use is unlikely to recur, including by signing an attestation or \nother such appropriate mitigation. Additionally, in light of the long-standing \nfederal law and policy prohibiting illegal drug use while occupying a \nsensitive position or holding a security clearance, agencies are \nencouraged to advise prospective national security workforce employees \nthat they should refrain from any future marijuana use upon initiation of the \nnational security vetting process, which commences once the individual \nsigns the certification contained in the Standard Form 86 (SF-86), \nQuestionnaire for National Security Positions.9   \nIn analyzing the facts of this case, I considered the following disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions as most pertinent: \nAG \u00b6 25(a) any substance misuse; \nAG \u00b6 25(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including \ncultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or \npossession of drug paraphernalia; \nAG \u00b6 26(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \nhappened under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not \ncast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and \n9 SecEA Clarifying Guidance Concerning Marijuana for Agencies Conducting Adjudications of Persons \nProposed for Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position, dated \nDecember 21, 2021, at page 2.  \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n                                                          \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 26(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including but not \nlimited to: (1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; (2) \nchanging or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; and (3) \nproviding a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement \nand substance misuse, acknowledging that any future involvement or \nmisuse is grounds of revocation of national security eligibility. \nThe evidence shows Applicant used and purchased marijuana on an infrequent \nbasis for more than a decade during 2008-2020. In particular, I note his continued \ninvolvement with marijuana after submitting his November 2019 security clearance \napplication and while holding a security clearance, which was granted in February 2020. \nHis last known use of marijuana occurred in September 2020, approximately two to \nthree months before submitting his December 2020 security clearance application for a \ntop-secret security clearance. \nAlthough the evidence shows Applicant used and purchased marijuana while \nholding a security clearance during 2020, the same evidence does not establish that he \ndid so while granted access to classified information, as alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b. \n(Exhibit 5) Note, eligibility for access to classified information and access to classified \ninformation are different concepts, as the latter requires a need to know.10 In short, \neligibility is granted by the central adjudication faculties (e.g., the DoD CAF), and \naccess is granted by the individual agencies. Applicant was granted eligibility in \nFebruary 2020, he denied having access, and his denial is unrebutted by the record \nevidence. Accordingly, on this basis, the disqualifying condition at AG \u00b6 25(f) does not \napply, and the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b are resolved in his favor. \nI have considered the totality of Applicant\u2019s involvement with marijuana as \noutlined in the findings of fact, including his last known misuse in September 2020. This \nmeans he used marijuana during his employment with a federal contractor engaged in \nthe defense industry. Any illegal drug use is relevant in the context of evaluating a \nperson\u2019s security worthiness, but it is particularly egregious if it occurs during the course \nof employment with a federal contractor. Furthermore, it is likely that his marijuana use \nin 2020 was in violation of his employer\u2019s drug-free workplace policy.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n11 \n10  Per DoD Manual 5200.02, Procedures for the DoD Personnel Security Program, effective April 3, 2017, \nthe term need to know means the following: \u201cA determination made by a possessor of classified \ninformation that a prospective recipient, in the interest of the national security, has a requirement for \naccess to, knowledge of, or possession of the classified information in order to perform tasks or services \nessential to the fulfillment of an official U.S. Government program. Knowledge of, possession of, or \naccess to, classified information will not be afforded to any individual solely by virtue of the individual\u2019s \noffice, position, or security eligibility.\u201d Id. at Glossary, p. 82.  \n11  ISCR Case No. 16-00578 (App. Bd.

The one item \nthat stands out in his favor is his candor and willingness to disclose his drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse during the security clearance process. But the credit \nin mitigation is limited due to his continued marijuana use after he received a favorable \nclearance decision in February 2020. \nI considered the two mitigating conditions noted above. Neither applies in \nApplicant\u2019s favor. His marijuana use occurred over a period of years and is recent \nenough to be of concern. Likewise, Applicant\u2019s signed statement of intent is outweighed \nby his continued marijuana use during 2020 while holding a security clearance. \nMoreover, his continued use of marijuana in 2020 while holding a security clearance \nwas dreadfully poor judgment. It simply cannot be overlooked, ignored, or explained \naway. Even under the new clarifying guidance issued by the DNI, Applicant\u2019s \nmisconduct continues to raise serious concerns about his reliability, trustworthiness, \nand good judgment. Although I have no axe to grind with marijuana users, I do have \nconcerns about applicants who affirmatively demonstrate they are unable or unwillingly \nto follow rules applicable to those granted the privilege of a security clearance. That is \nthe situation here. \nFollowing Egan and the clearly consistent standard, I have doubts and concerns\nabout Applicant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, good judgment, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. In reaching this conclusion, I weighed the evidence\nas a whole and considered if the favorable evidence outweighed the unfavorable \nevidence or vice versa. I also considered the whole-person concept. I conclude that he\nhas not met his ultimate burden of persuasion to show that it is clearly consistent with\nthe national interest to grant him eligibility for access to classified information.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFormal Findings \nThe formal findings on the SOR allegations are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.a -- 1.b: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.c -- 1.d: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \naccess to classified information.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact In his Answer, Applicant admitted SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b concerning his history of marijuana use and use after submitting his SCA. He denied SOR \u00b6 1c, concerning his future intent to use marijuana. His admissions are incorporated into the findings of fact. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, evidence submitted, and testimony, I make the following additional findings of fact. Applicant is 57 years old. He earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in 1989. He works as a senior cyber and software expert and executive for a computer software company that contracts with the U.S. Government. He was married in 1999 and has no children. This is his first application for a security clearance. (Tr. 16-19; GE 1) Applicant disclosed on his SCA that he used marijuana from May 1979 to July 2020. He reported that he has lived in states where marijuana use was legal and that he intended to continue his use it. Applicant was interviewed by a government investigator in September 2020, and he disclosed historical information about his marijuana use, and stated that he saw no reason to stop using marijuana. He was told by a government investigator that illegal drug usage is incompatible with maintaining a security clearance regardless of any particular state law, and his use would preclude him from holding a security clearance. He asserted that he is not dependent on marijuana usage and could stop if someone from the government told him that he needed to refrain from use. (GE 1, ",

Government Exhibits \n(GE) 1 and 2 were admitted in evidence without objection. Applicant did not provide any \ndocumentation at the hearing. I held the record open to provide him with the opportunity \nto submit documentary evidence after the hearing. He timely submitted documents that I \nmarked as Appellant\u2019s Exhibits (AE) A-F, and admitted into evidence without objection. \nFindings of Fact  \nIn his Answer, Applicant admitted SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b concerning his history of \nmarijuana use and use after submitting his SCA. He denied SOR \u00b6 1c, concerning his \nfuture intent to use marijuana. His admissions are incorporated into the findings of fact. \nAfter a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, evidence submitted, and \ntestimony, I make the following additional findings of fact. \nApplicant is 57 years old. He earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in 1989. He works as a \nsenior cyber and software expert and executive for a computer software company that \ncontracts with the U.S. Government. He was married in 1999 and has no children. This \nis his first application for a security clearance. (Tr. 16-19; GE 1) \nApplicant disclosed on his SCA that he used marijuana from May 1979 to July \n2020. He reported that he has lived in states where marijuana use was legal and that he \nintended to continue his use it. Applicant was interviewed by a government investigator \nin September 2020, and he disclosed historical information about his marijuana use, \nand stated that he saw no reason to stop using marijuana. He was told by a government \ninvestigator that illegal drug usage is incompatible with maintaining a security clearance \nregardless of any particular state law, and his use would preclude him from holding a \nsecurity clearance. He asserted that he is not dependent on marijuana usage and could \nstop if someone from the government told him that he needed to refrain from use. (GE \n1, 2) \nApplicant testified that he has been forthright about his history of marijuana use. \nHe stated that his use has been sporadic over time, and he has never had an addiction \nor a problem with marijuana. He asserted that he has never been a daily user, and that \nhe used it more frequently when he was living in states where it was legalized. He \nstated that he now understands that the marijuana prohibition in federal law supersedes \nstate legalization. (Tr. 20-22) \nApplicant used marijuana a limited number of times after filling out his July 2020 \nSCA, and his September 2020 interview with a government investigator. He asserted \nthat he stopped using marijuana in June 2021, when he filled out his interrogatory \nresponse. He stated that he knows that he cannot change the past, but he made a \ndecision when he submitted his interrogatory response to discontinue use. He respects \nhis employer and his role with them, and since he used marijuana so infrequently, his \ndecision to abstain was not difficult.

When he moved from \nState A where marijuana was legal and available, to less permissive State B in February \nof 2020, the frequency of his marijuana use dropped. He asserted that he has only used \nmarijuana ten times since moving to State B, and he has only used it at home with his \nwife. He claims they purchased it only one time after moving to State B, through a \ndispensary. His wife still uses marijuana, and has used it more frequently than he has. \n(Tr. 23-30, 33-36) \nHis employer\u2019s drug and alcohol policy prohibits use or possession or both at \nwork, as well as use before work or while conducting business. It also states that \ncriminal convictions involving either will not be tolerated. He stated that he has never \nhad a random drug screening by his current employer, but has passed drug tests given \nin two prior positions. His employer and FSO is aware of his past marijuana use, and \nthe specific allegations in the SOR. (Tr. 26-33; AE A) \nWhen asked why he still used marijuana after filling out his SCA and his interview \nwith a government investigator, Applicant stated that he thought that he would be \nprecluded from receiving a security clearance because of his history with marijuana. He \nstated that his answers about his future intent for use on his SCA and to the \ninvestigator, which did not present him in a positive light, were also rooted in that belief. \nHe expressed this belief at the start of his hearing. He asserted that even after forty \nyears of sporadic use, he was able to abstain from marijuana use for the last year, \nbecause it is not important to him. He asserted that he has gone years without using \nmarijuana in the past, and it was not a problem for him. (Tr. 19-21, 26-33) \nHe stated that he understands why marijuana use creates risks and \nvulnerabilities beyond the issue of impairment. He knows that his requirement to refrain \nfrom marijuana use, and the obligations and behavior expected of a security clearance \nholder transcends duty hours, and is required whenever and wherever he may be. (Tr. \n37-44) \nApplicant stated that since he moved in early 2020, the circumstances where he \nhad used marijuana changed, as he is no longer in social situations or environments \nwhere it was used. He is still in contact with friends with whom he used marijuana in \nState A, but they live 2000 miles away. He stated that he would not be obliged to use \nmarijuana if offered; it was never important to him, and he will continue to abstain. (Tr. \n37-44) \nApplicant claims that his career history shows that he has good judgement, and \ncan follow rules and regulations. He submitted four letters of recommendation and a \npersonal profile, career history, and performance review package into the record. The \nletters highlighted his character, judgement, honesty, and professional skills.

As the \nSupreme Court held in Department of the Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe clearly consistent standard \nindicates that security determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d \n484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988). \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have not drawn inferences grounded on \nmere speculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nAG \u00b6 24 expresses the security concern regarding drug involvement: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription drugs, and the use of other substances that can cause \nphysical or mental impairment or are used in a manner inconsistent with \ntheir intended use can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability and \ntrustworthiness, both because such behavior may lead to physical or \npsychological impairment and because it raises questions about a \nperson\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \nControlled substance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d as defined in 21 \nU.S.C 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in this guideline \nto describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nI have considered the disqualifying conditions for drug involvement under AG \u00b6 \n25 and the following are potentially applicable: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including\u2026 purchase; and \n(g) expressed intent to continue drug involvement and substance misuse \nor failure to clearly and convincingly commit to discontinue such misuse. \nThe Controlled Substances Act (\u201cCSA\u201d) makes it illegal under Federal law to \nmanufacture, possess, or distribute certain drugs, including marijuana. (Controlled \nSubstances Act, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 801, et seq. See \u00a7 844). All controlled substances are \nclassified into five schedules, based on their accepted medical uses, their potential for \nabuse, and their psychological and physical effects on the body. \u00a7\u00a7811, 812. Marijuana \nis classified as a Schedule I controlled substance, \u00a7812(c), based on its high potential \nfor abuse, no accepted medical use, and no accepted safety for use in medically \nsupervised treatment. \u00a7812(b)(1). See Gonzales v. Raich, 545 U.S. 1 (2005). \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b is established by the SCA, background interview, and \nApplicant\u2019s admissions. AG \u00b6\u00b6 25 (a) and (c) apply. Applicant has clearly and \nconvincingly committed to abstain from future marijuana use, and has abstained for the \nlast year. SOR \u00b6 1.c is not established, and AG \u00b6 25(g) does not apply. \nI have considered the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 26. The following are \npotentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \nand \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: (1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; (2) \nchanging or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; and (3) \nproviding a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement \nand substance misuse, acknowledging that any future involvement is \ngrounds for revocation of national security eligibility. \nApplicant used marijuana with varying frequency, over a forty-year period. He \nasserted that he has gone periods where he did not use marijuana for years, and claims \nhe has never had an addiction to it. He used marijuana more frequently when he lived in \na place where it was permitted under state law and socially acceptable. After moving to \na less permissive place, his use was sporadic, and he has abstained for a year. He \ncredibly stated that marijuana is not important to him, and he has committed to abstain. \nHe has provided sufficient evidence showing that his past marijuana use occurred under \ncircumstances that are unlikely to recur. AG \u00b6\u00b6 26 (a) applies. \nApplicant has been forthcoming with his history of marijuana use. He made a late \ndecision during his security clearance application process to abstain from further \nmarijuana use. He assertion that he has not used marijuana for a year, and that he \nwould maintain abstinence is credible. Friends who he used marijuana with now live \n2000 miles away. Since his move, he is longer in social situations where marijuana is \nused. While his wife may continue to sporadically use marijuana, he has convincingly \nstated that her use of marijuana would not affect his commitment to abstinence. In this \ncase there is an acknowledgment of his history with marijuana, a change in \ncircumstances, and an established pattern of abstinence. AG \u00b6\u00b6 26 (b) applies. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI have considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of \nall the facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have considered Applicant\u2019s \nletters of recommendation, and his personal profile, career history, and performance \nreview package. I had the chance to assess Applicant\u2019s credibility at the hearing, and I \nfound his testimony to be believable. \nApplicant\u2019s assertion that he has abstained from marijuana for a year, and has no \nfuture intent to use it is credible. He went into the hearing erroneously believing that he \nwas ineligible to be granted a security clearance because he had any history with \nmarijuana, yet he still decided to abstain one year ago. His motivation to end his \nsporadic marijuana use was a realization that it was not important to him. He is 57 years \nold and has reached a different stage in his life. He respects his employer and his \nleadership role with the company. He has been entrusted with significant responsibility \nin his professional roles over the years. In his personal and professional life, he has \ndemonstrated trustworthiness, responsibility, and good judgement. \nOverall, I find that Applicant\u2019s testimony was credible, that he has established a \nsufficient pattern of abstinence of marijuana use, and that he has no future intent to use \nit. He has met his burden of mitigating the drug involvement and substance misuse \nsecurity concerns under Guideline H. In whole, the record evidence leaves me without \nquestions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.c: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant a security \nclearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is 45 years old. He has been employed by a defense contractor as an engineering technician since January 2019, and previously worked for the same contractor from 2012 to October 2018. He married in 1996 and divorced in 2010. He has three children. He earned an associate\u2019s degree in 2009. He has held a security clearance since 2012. The SOR alleges 25 delinquent debts, including consumer debts, student loans, credit cards, medical, housing and utility debts, unemployment insurance and traffic court debts, totaling about $93,000. Under Guideline E, the SOR alleges that Applicant\u201ds employer-provided travel credit card was confiscated in 2016 for misuse to pay personal expenses unrelated to employee travel; and that in January 2020, Applicant was charged with robbery, and pleaded guilty to lesser offenses of petty theft and unlawful restraint. In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted all of the SOR allegations with some explanations, but he provided no additional documentary evidence. The evidence provided in the FORM is reliable and sufficient to support the SOR allegations. In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant stated that a $330 debt owed for unemployment insurance overpayment was \u201cpaid in full\u201d (SOR \u00b6 1.o); and that seven traffic court delinquencies (parking tickets) totaling $810 were also \u201cpaid in full\u201d (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.r \u2013 1.x).

A complete copy of the FORM was provided to \nApplicant, who was afforded an opportunity to file objections and submit material to refute, \nrebut, or mitigate the security concerns. Applicant received the FORM on August 31, \n2021. He did not respond to the FORM, object to the Government\u2019s exhibits, or submit \nadditional documentary evidence for my consideration. The case was assigned to me on \nNovember 9, 2021. Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 11 are admitted into evidence \nwithout objection. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is 45 years old. He has been employed by a defense contractor as an \nengineering technician since January 2019, and previously worked for the same \ncontractor from 2012 to October 2018. He married in 1996 and divorced in 2010. He has \nthree children. He earned an associate\u2019s degree in 2009. He has held a security clearance \nsince 2012. \nThe SOR alleges 25 delinquent debts, including consumer debts, student loans, \ncredit cards, medical, housing and utility debts, unemployment insurance and traffic court \ndebts, totaling about $93,000. Under Guideline E, the SOR alleges that Applicant\u201ds \nemployer-provided travel credit card was confiscated in 2016 for misuse to pay personal \nexpenses unrelated to employee travel; and that in January 2020, Applicant was charged \nwith robbery, and pleaded guilty to lesser offenses of petty theft and unlawful restraint. In \nhis Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted all of the SOR allegations with some \nexplanations, but he provided no additional documentary evidence. The evidence \nprovided in the FORM is reliable and sufficient to support the SOR allegations. \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant stated that a $330 debt owed for \nunemployment insurance overpayment was \u201cpaid in full\u201d (SOR \u00b6 1.o); and that seven \ntraffic court delinquencies (parking tickets) totaling $810 were also \u201cpaid in full\u201d (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.r \u2013 1.x). No documentary evidence in support of these assertions was provided. He \nadmitted all of the remaining SOR debts without explanations as to their status.  \nApplicant was interviewed by government investigators in 2012 and 2020. His \nfinancial problems predate 2012. In his most recent interview of August 2020, he noted \nthat he was not making any monthly payments on his delinquent debts, although at times \nhe stated his belief that some of his debts may have been satisfied or were too old to \ncollect. \nApplicant said his student loan debts were turned over to collections in 2005 due \nto nonpayment. He did not have a plan to address them. He stated that he neglected to \npay on his loans after accruing too much debt in the past 12 years, and that he was \n\u201coverwhelmed.\u201d He has not made payments on other debts, largely due to his divorce, \nchild support obligations, and periods of underemployment and unemployment. Applicant \nreceived unemployment insurance benefits in late 2018 or 2019, but was overpaid. He \nalso resorted to several payday loans that became delinquent, and he had not reimbursed \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nthe state employment office because he was too overwhelmed with other finances.

During this time, his car was \nrepossessed. \nThe 2016 eviction resulted in a judgment and wage garnishment for $5,500. He \nused his company travel credit card to pay for his personal expenses, including for a \nstorage unit, car insurance, and other emergency expenses. He claimed there was no \ncompany policy on the use of the travel card, and that \u201cmany people were doing it, \nincluding his supervisor.\u201d He believes he paid the full balance off in 2017. \nIn January 2020, he reported that he had a dispute with his girlfriend over her \nalleged infidelity. He forcibly took her cell phone out of her hand and ran away with it. He \nwas arrested and charged with robbery. He pleaded guilty to petty theft and unlawful \nrestraint. He was ordered to attend a domestic violence offender course. \nApplicant provided no recent documentary evidence of his current financial status, \ndebt resolutions, or of any credit counseling. He noted in his recent interview that he \nincurred most of his debts as a result of his divorce and periods of underemployment or \nunemployment. He stated that he has $3,000 in a checking account, and a net monthly \nremainder of $858 after paying monthly expenses. He supplements his income by selling \nhis plasma. \nPolicies \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nNational security eligibility is predicated upon the applicant meeting the criteria \ncontained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. \nInstead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies \nthese guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider a person\u2019s stability, trustworthiness, reliability, \ndiscretion, character, honesty, and judgment. AG \u00b6 1(b). \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nclassified information.

Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \u201cSubstantial \nevidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. Washington \nMetro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines presume a \nnexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria listed \ntherein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 12-01295 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Jan. 20, 2015). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. \n02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01- \n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see, AG \u00b6 1(d). \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . .  \nThe relevant disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 19 include: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and documentary evidence in the record are sufficient to \nestablish disqualifying conditions AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and (c). \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially relevant: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \nApplicant claims to have incurred most of his debts as a result of his divorce and \nperiods of underemployment or unemployment. His debts are numerous, long-standing, \nand a continuing financial concern. Additionally, his overall financial responsibility has \nbeen significantly impugned, and he has done little to show that he is responsible and \ntrustworthy. \nApplicant has not shown sufficient evidence of his plan of action to address his \ndebts, despite being divorced since 2010, and employed full time in his current position \nsince 2019. Although he claimed that he satisfied some of the debts, he did not provide \nevidence in support of his assertions. \nBased on the record presented, I am not persuaded that Applicant\u2019s debts have \nbeen or will be satisfactorily resolved. I also have not been presented with sufficient \nevidence showing Applicant\u2019s current financial status, ability to pay debts and expenses \nin a timely manner, and any formal personal financial counseling to assist him in avoiding \nfuture financial mistakes. As a result, and without more documentary evidence, I remain \ndoubtful about Applicant\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. For \nthese reasons, none of the mitigating conditions fully apply to the SOR debts and his \noverall financial responsibility. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n       \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 15: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. \nThe relevant disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b616 are: \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issues areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single guideline, \nbut which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-person \nassessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack \nof candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other \ncharacteristics indicating that the individual may not properly safeguard \nclassified or sensitive information; and \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information, \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with \nrules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual \nmay not properly safeguard classified or sensitive information. This includes \nbut is not limited to, consideration of: \n. \n.\n. \n(3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations; and  \n(4) evidence of significant misuse of Government or other employer\u2019s \ntime or resources. \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the evidence support a finding of questionable \njudgment and dishonesty in the misuse of his employer\u2019s travel card and the criminal \nconvictions. AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(c) and (d) apply. \nConditions that could mitigate personal conduct security concerns are provided \nunder AG \u00b6 17. The following are potentially applicable: \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, \nor other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur; and \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability\nto exploitation, manipulation, or duress. \n \nApplicant\u2019s conduct, taken as a whole, shows signs of questionable judgment, \nhowever his actions appear to be isolated events. The misuse of his employer\u2019s travel \ncard is dated, being about six years old and may have arisen from an uncertain company \npolicy or lax enforcement. Applicant claims to have paid the card off, and he no longer \nhas one. AG \u00b6 17(c) applies. The dispute with his girlfriend was apparently serious \nenough for her to call the police, however it did not result in serious consequences, rather \nApplicant attended a domestic violence course. There is no evidence of a pattern of \nmisconduct related to domestic violence or abuse, and no similar criminal complaints \nhave followed. It appears to have been a unique incident involving a relational dispute \nthat got out of hand, and no evidence was presented to show he has abusive or criminal \ntendencies. AG \u00b6 17(c) and (d) are marginally applicable. \nWhole-Person Concept \nThe ultimate determination of whether to grant national security eligibility must be \nan overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines \nand the whole-person concept. Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge \nmust evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality \nof the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances. AG \u00b6\u00b6 2(a), 2(c), and 2(d). The \nadministrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 \n2(d). \nI considered all of the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my findings of fact \nand comments under Guidelines F and E in my whole-person analysis. I considered \nApplicant\u2019s divorce and history of financial hardships. I also evaluated this case under the \nconditions in which a conditional clearance may be granted. \nBecause Applicant requested a determination on the record without a hearing, I \nhad no opportunity to evaluate his credibility and sincerity based on demeanor, or to \nfurther inquire about financial matters. See ISCR Case No. 01-12350 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Jul. \n23, 2003). After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline F, \nand evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant \nhas not mitigated the security concerns raised by his delinquent debts. The Guideline E \nallegations are mitigated. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nFor Applicant \n Subparagraphs 2.a and 2.b: \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n_______________________ \n Subparagraphs 1.a through 1.y: \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interest of the \nUnited States to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation.

He requested a hearing before an administrative judge. The case was assigned to \nme on February 28, 2022. The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued \na Notice of Hearing on April 21, 2022, scheduling the case to be heard via video \nteleconference on May 24, 2022. \nI convened the hearing as scheduled. Department Counsel offered Government \nExhibits (GE) 1 and 2, which were admitted without objection. Applicant offered seven \nexhibits, which I marked as Applicant Exhibits (AE) A through G, which were admitted \nwithout objection. Applicant also testified on his own behalf. DOHA received the transcript \nof the hearing (Tr.) on June 6, 2022. (Tr. at 16-20.) \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is 30 years old and unmarried. He earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2018. \nApplicant has been employed by a defense contractor as a financial analyst since \nDecember 2020. He is a first-time applicant seeking to obtain national security eligibility \nin connection with his employment. (Tr. at 21-22, 51.) \nParagraph 1 (Guideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Involvement) \nThe Government alleged in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance \nbecause he has a history of drug involvement. Specifically, the SOR alleged that \nApplicant purchased and used marijuana with varying frequency from about 2010 through \nDecember 2020 (SOR 1.a). The SOR also alleged that Applicant purchased and used \nmarijuana after completing his e-QIP and submitting it on December 2, 2020 (SOR 1.b). \nThe Government alleged further in the SOR that Applicant intends to continue using \nmarijuana in the future (SOR 1.c). \nIn his Answer, Applicant denied part of SOR 1.a and all of SOR 1.c. He wrote that \nhe had not purchased marijuana prior to relocating to State 1 in 2017, where it was legal \nto do so under state law. He also wrote that he had only used marijuana a few times prior \nto 2017. He admitted the allegations in SOR 1.b and wrote that he was unaware of the \nsignificance of the difference between Federal and state law with respect to the use of \nmarijuana in the context of Federal employment until he \u201cwent through the process of \napplying for my clearance.\u201d (Answer at 1.) \nApplicant first smoked marijuana in 2010 with his college basketball teammates in \nState 2. This use occurred on a few occasions. He subsequently transferred colleges \ntwice to continue his college basketball experience at larger universities. He did not \nsmoke marijuana during those college years because he was no longer associating with \nthe same teammates. In about 2013 or 2014 while a college student, Applicant\u2019s \ngrandmother died. He was close to his grandmother, and he suffered a serious emotional \nloss. A therapist suggested that he try CBD to help him handle the stress and anxiety he \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nwas experiencing. In about 2017, Applicant was treated by a doctor for a serious and \npainful medical condition. The doctor gave him a prescription for medical marijuana, \nwhich was legal at that time in State 1 where Applicant resided. A physical therapist who \ntreated Applicant also recommended that he use medical marijuana for his condition. (Tr. \nat 29, 35-40.) \nApplicant used marijuana medically and on occasion he used it with friends for \nrecreational purposes, which was also legal in State 1 at that time. He purchased \nmarijuana at a legal medical marijuana dispensary. He smoked the marijuana or ate it in \nedible form. (Tr. at 40-43.) \nApplicant\u2019s December 2, 2020 e-QIP was followed later that month with his \nbackground interview. He initially advised the interviewer that he would like to continue \nusing marijuana for medical purposes if that was allowed. In a follow-up phone call, he \nexplicitly told the interviewer that he did not intend to use marijuana in the future for any \npurpose. He was concerned that the interviewer may have misunderstood his earlier \ncomments on the subject of his intent to use marijuana in the future. He testified at the \nhearing that he has no intention of using marijuana in the future, and he provided a written \nstatement memorializing his intention. He earnestly testified that he will keep that promise \nand has agreed in his written statement to the revocation of any security clearance \ngranted to him should he violate his commitment in the future. He stopped using \nmarijuana in or about December 2020 and now addresses his medical needs through \ndaily meditation. He credibly testified that he does not recall whether he used marijuana \nduring the three-week period after he submitted his e-QIP and the time of his background \ninterview or whether he advised the interviewer that he had done so. (Tr. at 58-60, 65; \nAE G.) \nIn April 2022, however, he used a vape pen containing marijuana. The pen was \noffered to him by a friend after an evening of drinking alcohol at a bar. Initially, Applicant \nbelieved the pen was a simple e-cigarette, but after using it, he thought it contained \nmarijuana. He asked his friend and the friend confirmed that it did. He then took one more \n\u201chit\u201d from the pen. He gave the pen back to his friend and knew that he had just made a \nmistake and was upset with himself. He let his friends know that he will not ever again \nconsume anything with marijuana so that a similar incident does not happen by mistake \nin the future. He now avoids smoking in general, whether it is an e-cigarette or a vape \npen. He testified that \u201c[I] knew that I had messed up [taking a second puff of marijuana \nfrom the vape pen].\u201d (Tr. at 60-63.) \nParagraph 2 (Guideline E, Personal Conduct) \nThe Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance \nbecause he has engaged in conduct that involves questionable judgment, lack of candor, \nand dishonesty. The SOR alleges that he falsified information in his e-QIP by denying any \nillegal purchase or use of drugs or controlled substances in the past seven years (SOR \n2.a). Applicant denied this allegation in his Answer and asserted that he misunderstood \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nthe e-QIP question. He explained that at the time he prepared his application, he \nunderstood that purchasing and using marijuana in State 1 was legal. (Answer at 1.) \nApplicant\u2019s December 2, 2020 e-QIP was followed by his background interview on \nDecember 29, 2020. Applicant viewed the interview as an extension of his application \ngiving him the opportunity to provide more detailed information than that which he had \nprovided in his e-QIP. Applicant and the interviewer discussed his answers to each \nquestion in the e-QIP. The interviewer explained to Applicant how the law of State 1 and \nFederal law differed on the legality of marijuana purchases and use. When he learned the \ndifference, he told the interviewer that he would like to change his answers to the \nquestions in Section 23 regarding the possession and use of illegal drugs. He advised the \ninterviewer that the correct answer to the e-QIP question was \u201cYes.\u201d He explained at the \nhearing that he answered the e-QIP question regarding illegal drug use in the negative \nbecause the purchase and use of marijuana was legal in his state. He had no intention to \nprovide false information on his e-QIP. (Tr. at 43-49, 54-57, 63.) \nApplicant noted at the hearing that his college drug use in 2010 and 2011 was \noutside the seven-year time frame of the question in the e-QIP. Accordingly, his only \nreportable drug use was after he relocated to State 1, where medical marijuana \npurchases and use were legal with a medical marijuana card. He explained that he had \nassumed incorrectly that the appropriate answer to the e-QIP questions was \u201cNo,\u201d since \nthe question references illegal use of drugs and he did not believe his use of marijuana \nin State 1 in the past seven years was illegal. He testified that the interviewer never \nconfronted him with information about Applicant\u2019s past use of marijuana prior to his \ndisclosure about his purchases and use of marijuana in State 1 starting in 2017. (Tr. at \n43-49, 54-57, 63; GE 2 at 8.) \nMitigation \nApplicant provided six character letters. Two are from work supervisors, two are \nfrom retired military personnel who have long-term relationships with Applicant, and two \nare from Applicant\u2019s parents. All of the letters describe Applicant as a person with a high \nmoral character and who is highly trustworthy. They strongly endorse Applicant\u2019s \nqualifications to hold a security clearance. (Tr. at 65-66; AE A-F.) \nApplicant also submitted a letter stating his intent to refrain from using illegal drugs \nin the future. His letter, dated May 15, 2022, post-dates his one puff experience with a \nvape pen in April 2022. He included in his letter the statement required by AG \u00b6 26(b)(3), \nwhich requires an acknowledgement by the Applicant that any breach of his commitment \nto abstain from illegal drug use in the future would be automatic grounds for the revocation \nof any security clearance granted to him. Applicant sincerely testified at the hearing that \nhe made this promise in writing because \u201cI meant it.\u201d (Tr. at 65; AE G.) \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines (AG) list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires, \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere speculation or \nconjecture. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14, requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants national \nsecurity eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as \nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or sensitive information. \nFinally, as emphasized in Section 7 of Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under \nthis order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest \nand shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d \nSee also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information.) \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nParagraph 1 (Guideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse) \nThe security concerns relating to the guideline for drug involvement and substance \nmisuse are set out in AG \u00b6 24, which reads as follows: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d as \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in \nthis guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above.      \nAG \u00b6 25 describes three conditions that could raise security concerns and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia; and \n(g) expressed intent to continue drug involvement and substance misuse, \nor failure to clearly and convincingly commit to discontinue such misuse. \nApplicant\u2019s detailed testimony regarding his history of drug purchases and use \nestablishes the disqualifying conditions AG \u00b6 25(a) and (c). Applicant\u2019s credible testimony \non the subject of his future intention with respect to using illegal drugs and his written \nstatement of intent are more than sufficient to render AG \u00b6 25(g) inapplicable. The record \nevidence regarding Applicant\u2019s purchases and use of marijuana after his relocation to \nState 1 in 2017 shifts the burden to Applicant to mitigate the security concerns raised by \nhis past conduct. \nThe guideline includes two conditions in AG \u00b6 26 that could mitigate the security \nconcerns arising from Applicant\u2019s alleged drug involvement and substance misuse: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome the problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all \ndrug involvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that \nany future involvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of \nnational security eligibility. \nBoth of the above mitigating conditions fully apply. With one limited exception, \nApplicant\u2019s last drug use occurred prior to December 2020 and was mostly under unusual \ncircumstances. He had been advised by medical professionals to use marijuana and CBD \nproducts to help him address a serious medical condition. Now that he knows that his use \nof marijuana is inconsistent with Federal law, his behavior is unlikely to recur. Moreover, \nhis past behavior does not cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good \njudgment. His one-time intentional puff of a vape pen containing marijuana was a mistake \nthat Applicant does not intend to repeat. \nIn my mitigation analysis, I have also taken administrative notice of the Security \nExecutive Agent \u201cClarifying Guidance Concerning Marijuana for Individuals Eligible to \nAccess Classified Information or Eligible to Hold a Sensitive Position,\u201d dated December \n21, 2021 (Guidance). In her Guidance, the Security Executive Agent (SecEA) noted the \nincreased number of states that have legalized or decriminalized the use of marijuana. \nShe reaffirmed SecEA\u2019s 2014 memorandum regarding the importance of compliance with \nFederal law on the illegality of the use of marijuana by holders of security clearances. She \nprovided further clarification of Federal marijuana policy writing that this policy remains \nrelevant to security clearance adjudications \u201cbut [is] not determinative.\u201d She noted that \nthe adjudicative guidelines provided various opportunities for a clearance applicant to \nmitigate security concerns raised by his or her past use of marijuana. (Guidance at 1.) \nFollowing careful consideration of the disqualifying and mitigating evidence, as well \nas SecEA\u2019s recent clarifying Guidance regarding Federal policy concerning marijuana, I \nconclude that Applicant has mitigated the security concerns raised by his past use of \nmarijuana. Paragraph 1 of the SOR is found in favor of Applicant. \nParagraph 2 (Guideline E, Personal Conduct) \nThe security concerns relating to the guideline for personal conduct are set out in \nAG \u00b6 15, which states: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. \nAG \u00b6 16 describes a condition that could raise security concerns and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \naward benefits or status, determine national security eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \nAppellant\u2019s credible testimony regarding his lack of intent to conceal information \nabout his past purchases and use of marijuana renders the above potentially disqualifying \ncondition inapplicable. Applicant was interviewed later in the same month as the date of \nhis submission of his e-QIP. He was completely candid with the investigator who \nconducted his background interview about his past drug use. He self-reported to the \ninvestigator the information alleged in the SOR, which evidences that he had no intent to \nconceal his past drug use. His timely disclosure has sufficient security significance to be \nmitigating under AG \u00b6 17(a) even if he had intentionally falsified his response on the e-\nQIP. \nAs a young man who spent most of his formative years playing college basketball \nat a very high level, Applicant lacked an understanding about the inconsistency between \nFederal and state law on the legality of marijuana and the significance of Federal law \nwhen answering the e-QIP question about past drug involvement. That inconsistency \nconfused Applicant when he answered a question about having \u201cillegally used any drugs \nor controlled substance\u201d since he believed his activities with marijuana were legal under \nthe laws of State 1. (GE 1 at 32.) I note that the instructions to Section 23 of the e-QIP \naddress this issue and advise that Federal law is controlling, but that instruction was \ninsufficient in this case to clarify the ambiguity. \nI closely observed Applicant\u2019s demeanor as a witness and found him to be credible, \nhonest, and forthright, which was consistent with the statements made about him in his \ncharacter evidence. His admission of one puff on a vape pen in April 2022 when he knew \nit contained marijuana revealed his character, candor, and integrity. He made a mistake \nand he owned it. At the time he prepared the e-QIP, Applicant lacked any intent to \ndeliberately conceal his past drug involvement in his e-QIP. Paragraph 2 of the SOR is \nfound in favor of Applicant. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for national security eligibility by considering the totality of the \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \napplicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should \nconsider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national security eligibility \nfor a security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI have incorporated my comments under the guidelines for Drug Involvement and \nSubstance Misuse, and Personal Conduct in my whole-person analysis. Some of the \nfactors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were addressed under those guidelines, but additional comment is \nwarranted. Applicant is an impressive young man who purchased and used marijuana \nafter moving to State 1 in 2017 where the purchase and use of marijuana was legal under \nthe laws of that state. He had no appreciation for the implications that the prohibition of \nsuch activities under Federal law would later have on his employment with the Federal \nGovernment or what was required to be disclosed on his e-QIP. The investigator who \nconducted his background interview educated Applicant about Federal law and the \ndisclosure requirements on a security clearance application and Applicant voluntarily \ndisclosed his past reportable conduct. He also maturely made the decision to refrain from \nany future use of marijuana. I do not view his one puff on a vape pen that he learned \ncontained THC to be of any security significance in light of Applicant\u2019s subsequent written \ncommitment to refrain from using marijuana or any illegal drugs in the future. \nApplicant has mitigated the security concerns raised by his past purchases and \nuse of marijuana. Also, the record evidence does not support a conclusion that he \ndeliberately falsified his e-QIP responses to Section 23. Overall, the record evidence \nleaves me without any questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s present suitability for national \nsecurity eligibility and a security clearance. \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.c: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s national security \neligibility for a security clearance.

As the pandemic is not an \nexcuse for one to not satisfy his or her financial obligations, this allegation is found \nagainst Applicant. \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines (AG) list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number \nof variables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must \nconsider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable \nand unfavorable, in making a decision. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14, requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \nA person applying for national security eligibility seeks to enter into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants national security eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or \nsensitive information. Finally, as emphasized in Section 7 of EO 10865, \u201c[a]ny \ndetermination under this order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms \nof the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information.) \nAnalysis \nGuideline F - Financial Considerations \nThe security concerns relating to the guideline for financial considerations are set \nout in AG \u00b6 18, which reads in pertinent part: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability \nto protect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can \nalso be caused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible \nindicator of, other issues of personnel security concern such as \nexcessive gambling, mental health conditions, substance misuse, or \nalcohol abuse or dependence. An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or \notherwise questionable acts to generate funds. . . . \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 19 describes three conditions that could raise security concerns and may \nbe disqualifying in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant has significant past-due indebtedness that he has yet to address. \nThese facts establish prima facie support for the foregoing disqualifying conditions, and \nshift the burden to Applicant to mitigate those concerns. \nThe guideline includes two conditions in AG \u00b6 20 that could mitigate the security \nconcerns arising from Applicant\u2019s alleged financial difficulties: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances. \nApplicant has more than $22,000 of admitted past-due debt, which he has \nchosen not to address. He is instead keeping his monies \u201cin the bank,\u201d while \nspeculating on possible, future job and health issues. This rationale is not acting \nresponsibly under the circumstances. Applicant has not mitigated the financial security \nconcerns under the provisions of AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) through 19(c). Financial Considerations is \nfound against Applicant. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________ \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national \nsecurity eligibility must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the applicable guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \npertinent facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant has not met his \nburden to mitigate the security concerns arising under the guideline for financial \nconsiderations. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a. and 1.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility \nand a security clearance.

He \nalso provided an explanation for each of the allegations. Applicant\u2019s admissions are \nincorporated into the findings of fact. After a thorough and careful review of the \npleadings and evidence submitted, I make the following additional findings of fact. \nApplicant is 62 years old. He has been employed as a logistics management \nspecialist by a defense contractor since 2017. He was granted a secret clearance in \nabout 2004. He served in the Army on active duty from 1979-1992, and in the reserve \nfrom 2001-2007. He was married in 1984 and divorced in 2007. He was remarried in \n2009 and divorced in 2018. He has two adult children. (Item 3) \nApplicant\u2019s SCA shows that he has been consistently employed since 2008. In \nhis Answer, he cited a number of factors that have impacted his finances, including: \nlow-paying work; his ex-wife\u2019s refusal to get conventional unemployment; failure of a \npart-time startup business; and reduced earnings when he left the military in 1992. \nSome of these issues caused him to file Chapter 13 Bankruptcy in 1995 and 2000. (Item \n2, 3) \nApplicant stated that his wife obtained information online that American citizens \nshould not pay taxes. He claims that he disagreed with her, but she refused to file. He \nstated that he had always paid his taxes on time without any issues. He asserted that \nafter they got divorced, he went to a tax preparation service, and found out that he could \nhave filed his tax returns \u201csingle\u201d during the years his wife refused to file. He reported \nthat he has agreements to pay his outstanding Federal and state taxes, and that he \nmakes automatic payments monthly. However, he did not provide sufficient \ndocumentation of these agreements or payments. (Item 2, 3) \nApplicant\u2019s IRS tax account records show that his 2014, 2015, and 2016 Federal \nincome tax returns were not filed until 2018. His 2017 return was filed on time. As of \nSeptember 2020, he owed the IRS: $14,876 for 2014; $13,046 for 2015; and $14,147 \nfor 2016. His records show that he made some payments on his 2015 taxes from \nFebruary 2020 to September 2020. The records also showed that he had an installment \nagreement for his 2017 taxes and made $110 payments from December 2018 to \nFebruary 2020.

Applicant wrote on this page that he pays $283.64 monthly, but provided no \nother documentation. The record also shows state tax liens filed in 2018 for $2,304 and \n$804. The first lien was satisfied in September 2019. (Item 8, 9) \nThe U.S. Army Central Personnel Security Clearance Facility warned Applicant in \n2002 that the retention of his security clearance was contingent on him avoiding future \nfinancial delinquencies. His 2011 SCA and credit report shows at that time he owed \napproximately $18,000 in child support, had a $738 tax lien, and defaulted on a $4,400 \nauto loan. (Item 4, 7, 14) \nThe SOR alleges three charged-off debts totaling $34,567; two Chapter 13 \nBankruptcies filed five years apart; failure to timely file three years of Federal and state \nincome tax returns; approximately $42,000 in unpaid Federal tax debt; and \napproximately $11,000 in unpaid state tax debt. The status of the debts follows: \nSOR \u00b6 1.a is credit-card account that was charged-off in 2016 for $8,642. \nApplicant stated that he became unemployed and unable to pay the account. He claims \nthat he contacted the creditor to negotiate a payment plan, but provided no \ndocumentation of those efforts. He stated that he forgot about the debt once he stopped \nreceiving notices in the mail. (Item 2, 5, 6, 13) \nSOR \u00b6 1.b is a credit-card account that was charged-off in 2016 for $7,032. In his \nAnswer, Applicant stated that this debt was for a loan for his wife to start an online travel \nbusiness, which failed. In his background interview, he stated that this was a credit card \nthat he was unable to pay when he lost his job. He claims that he contacted the creditor \nto negotiate a payment plan, but provided no documentation of those efforts. He admits \nthat he ignored notices in the mail about this debt, since he cannot pay it. (Item 2, 5, 6, \n13) \nSOR \u00b6 1.c is an auto loan that was charged-off in 2017 for $18,893. Applicant \nstated that he purchased a van to start a part-time delivery service after getting laid off \nfrom his job. The delivery service was not successful, and he defaulted on the loan after \nsix months. He stated that he returned the vehicle to the dealership, and was charged \nfor the full cost of the vehicle. (Item 2, 5, 6, 13) \nSOR \u00b6 1.d is a Chapter 13 Bankruptcy filed by Applicant in 1995, which was \ndischarged in July 2000. He stated that after leaving active duty with the Army, his pay \ndramatically changed, and he could no longer afford his expenses. (Item 2) \nSOR \u00b6 1.e is a Chapter 13 Bankruptcy filed by Applicant in December 2000, \nwhich was discharged in April 2006. He stated his job situation had not changed after \nleaving active duty, and he was still working a low-paying job.

Applicant stated that \nhe makes monthly payments which are automatically debited from his bank account. \nHis tax records show some payments up to September 2020. However, he has not \nprovided information showing a more recent track record of payments, or \ndocumentation of an installment agreement for his Federal tax debt. (Item 2, 8, 13) \nSOR \u00b6 1.i is a $11,000 state tax debt for tax years 2014-2016. Applicant asserted \nthat he makes monthly payments which are automatically debited from his bank \naccount. However, he failed to provide documentation of payments, or an installment \nagreement to repay this debt. (Item 2, 8, 13) \nApplicant did not submit any documentation concerning his current financial \nsituation, such as his monthly income and expenses, his assets, or whether he follows a \nbudget. In 2020, he reported that he has about $3,000 of discretionary funds at the end \nof each month. No evidence was provided that Applicant has received credit counseling. \n(Item 13) \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  \nTimely filing of income tax returns and paying taxes owed is a basic duty for U.S. \ncitizens, and is required by law. The Appeal Board has held that \u201ca security clearance\nrepresents an obligation to the Federal Government for the protection of national\nsecrets. Accordingly, failure to honor other obligations to the Government has a direct\nbearing on an Applicant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified\n \n \n \n \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ninformation as reflected in the Guideline F concerns that were alleged.\u201d (ISCR Case No. \n14-03358 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 9, 2015)). \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n(b) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income tax \nreturns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as required. \nThe SOR allegations are established by Applicant\u2019s admissions, tax records, and \nthe credit reports in the record. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) ,19(c), and 19(f) apply. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nApplicant did not provide sufficient evidence to establish that AG \u00b6 20(a) should \napply. There is a record of financial problems and delinquencies going back to the mid-\n1990\u2019s. He did not provide sufficient documentation showing that his three charged-off \ndebts, and his Federal and state tax debts are currently being paid, or have been \nresolved. He provided no documentation of his current financial situation, evidence \nwhich might establish his ability to address his debts responsibly. His failures to pay his \ncharged-off debts and tax debts are recent, not isolated, and are ongoing and \nunresolved. This continues to cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and \ngood judgment. AG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply.  \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \nWhile Applicant claims that loss of employment caused him to default on some of \nhis debts, he did not report any periods of unemployment on his SCA. While his wife \nrefused to file tax returns with him, he did not get professional advice about how to meet \nhis legal obligations for his taxes until years after they were due. This failure was not \ndue to reasons beyond his control. There is insufficient evidence in the record to show \nthat he undertook responsible action to make payment arrangements for them. AG \u00b6 \n20(b) does not apply. \nSimilarly, Applicant did not provide sufficient evidence to show that he is currently \npaying his debts, or has current payment arrangements in place. AG \u00b6 20(d) partially \napplies because he provided evidence that some payments were made towards his \n2015 taxes. However, he did not provide sufficient documentation to show that he is \ncurrently resolving the rest of his tax debt or charged-off debt. AG \u00b6 20(d) does not fully \napply. \nAG \u00b6 20(g) partially applies because Applicant filed his 2014-2016 returns in \n2018, and made some payments towards is 2015 taxes. However, he filed his returns \nyears late, and still has a considerable amount of delinquent state and Federal tax debt. \nWhile he claims that he has made recent payments and has a payment plan, he did not \nprovide sufficient documentation of these efforts. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(g) does not apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. Applicant did not provide \nsufficient evidence to mitigate the security concerns arising out of Applicant\u2019s charged-\n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \noff debts, failure to timely file Federal and state income tax returns, and pay Federal and \nstate tax debt under Guideline F. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST A\n PPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.i: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \na security clearance.
