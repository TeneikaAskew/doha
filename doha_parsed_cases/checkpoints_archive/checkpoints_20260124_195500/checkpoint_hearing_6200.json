This action was taken under Executive Order 10865, dated\nFebruary 20, 1960, as amended, and DoD Directive 5220.6, dated January 2, 1992, as amended. He\nanswered the SOR on May 10, 2007, admitting the allegations and requesting a hearing.\nThe case was assigned to me on June 22, 2007. On July 6, 2007, DOHA issued a notice of\nhearing scheduling it for August 1, 2007. During the hearing, I received four government exhibits,\nnine Applicant exhibits, and the testimony of three Applicant witnesses. DOHA received the\ntranscript on August 10, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT \nThe SOR admissions are incorporated into the findings of fact. In addition, I make the\nfollowing findings of fact.\nApplicant is a 46-year-old divorced man with two adult children. He is a veteran of the U.S.\nCoast Guard, serving from 1980 through his disability retirement in 1998. After leaving the Coast\nGuard, Applicant began working as a driver for an armored car delivery company. \nOne day in October 2001, the driver of a work vehicle in which Applicant was a passenger\nlost control, began hydroplaning, and crashed.  Consequently, Applicant suffered serious, soft tissue\n1\ninjuries to his neck, knee, and left shoulder, rendering him unable to work.\nDespite an intensive treatment regimen, including prescription painkillers, multiple cortisone\ninjections, physical rehabilitation, and shoulder surgery, Applicant remained unable to work for\nnearly five years. He had no earnings during this period.  For the first two years of his disability, his\n2\nincome loss was partially offset by worker\u2019s compensation benefits.  By 2003, however, he had\n3\n\nId.\n4\nTr. 60.\n5\nTr. 62, 71.\n6\nExhibit H; Tr. 62.\n7\nId.\n8\nTr. 91.\n9\nTr. 63.\n10\nTr. 41, 96.\n11\nTr. 40-41, 94; Exhibit A.\n12\nTr. 41.\n13\nExhibit D; Tr. 42.\n14\nExhibit F.\n15\n3\nexhausted these benefits.  From October 2003 through February  2006, Applicant\u2019s only income was\n4\nhis Coast Guard pension.  \n5\nAt or about the time of the accident, Applicant was helping both of his children pay their\ncollege tuition, and was paying child support.  In 2003, his mother suffered a disability that\n6\nprevented her from working.  Applicant then began providing her approximately eighty to one\n7\nhundred dollars per month in financial support.8\nAs Applicant disability persisted, he gradually began accruing delinquencies. He managed\nto make some payments through a credit card insurance program, but the benefits expired before he\nwas cleared to return to work.  Before the injury, he had no financial problems.  By February 2006,\n9\n10\nwhen his doctor cleared him to return to work, he was indebted to 20 creditors in the approximate\namount of $96,000. All of the delinquencies were either credit card accounts or lines of credit. Eight\naccounts  were not included in the SOR. SOR subparagraphs 1.c, 1.d, and 1.n are duplicates.\nAfter being cleared to work, Applicant left his old job, and began working in March 2007\nas a security guard. He has remained engaged in this line of work since that time.\nAs soon as Applicant returned to work, he began paying his delinquencies. Between March\n2006 and January 2007, he made $10,000 of debt payments, satisfying eight creditors, unlisted on\nthe SOR, in their entirety.  For approximately six months during this period, beginning in June\n11\n2006, he utilized a credit counseling company to help him adhere to a debt repayment plan.12\nIn January 2007, Applicant sought legal counsel after one of his creditors threatened to sue\nhim.  In March 2007, he filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy protection.  Two months later, the court\n13\n14\nappointed a trustee to administer Applicant\u2019s bankruptcy plan payments.  Under the plan,\n15\napproximately half of the delinquencies will be discharged, and Applicant is to pay $745 per month\n\nTr. 23. \n16\nTr. 28.\n17\n4\nfor 60 months. He has been making payments since June 2007. In July 2007, the court entered a\nwage order to enable payments to be deducted from his paycheck. All of the delinquencies in the\nSOR are included in the bankruptcy plan.\nApplicant is highly respected on the job. At the hearing, a coworker characterized him as an\nupstanding citizen who is honest and hardworking.  His supervisor characterized him as an excellent\n16\nemployee with sound judgment and decision-making skills.17\nPOLICIES\nThe adjudicative guidelines, as revised December 29, 2005, and implemented September 1,\n2006, apply to the analysis of this case. In addition to brief introductory explanations for each\nguideline, they are divided into those that may be considered in deciding whether to deny or revoke\nan individual\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information (disqualifying conditions) and those\nthat may be considered in deciding whether to grant an individual\u2019s eligibility for access to classified\ninformation (mitigating conditions).\nBecause the entire process is a scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person\nconcept,\u201d all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and\nunfavorable, should be considered in making a meaningful decision. Specifically these are: (1) the\nnature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding circumstances; (2) the frequency and recency\nof the conduct; (3) the age of the applicant; (4) the motivation of the applicant, and the extent to\nwhich the conduct was negligent, willful, voluntary, or undertaken with knowledge of the\nconsequences; (5) the absence or presence of rehabilitation; and (6) the probability that the\ncircumstances or conduct will continue or recur in the future.\nThe following adjudicative guideline is raised:\nGuideline F - Financial Considerations: Failure or inability to live within one\u2019s\nmeans, satisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control,\nlack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can\nraise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information.\nConditions pertaining to this adjudicative guideline that could raise a security concern and may be\ndisqualifying, as well as those which could mitigate security concerns, are set forth and discussed\nin the conclusions below.\nSince the protection of national security is the paramount consideration, the final decision\nin each case must be reached by applying the standard that the issuance of the clearance is \u201cclearly\n\nSee generally, Directive, Sec. 2.3, Sec. 2.5.3, Sec. 3.2, and Sec. 4.2.\n18\n5\nconsistent with the national interest.\u201d   In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those\n18\nconclusions that are based on the evidence contained in the record.\nThe Government is responsible for presenting evidence to establish facts in the SOR that\nhave been controverted. The applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to rebut, explain,\nextenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by the Government, and has the\nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\nCONCLUSIONS\nApplicant\u2019s history of financial problems triggers the application of Financial Considerations\nDisqualifying Conditions (FC DC) 19(a): inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts, FC DC 19(c):\na history of not meeting financial obligations, and FC DC 19(e): consistent spending beyond one\u2019s\nmeans, which may be indicated by excessive indebtedness, significant negative cash flow, high debt-\nto-income ratio, and/or other financial analysis. \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems did not begin until he was seriously disabled by an on-the-job\ninjury which prevented him from working for nearly five years. At the same time he was disabled,\nhis mother became disabled, compelling him to attempt to help her financially, and he was helping\nhis two children with their college tuition.\nShortly after Applicant was cleared to begin working, he retained a credit counseling agency,\nsatisfied eight of his delinquencies in the amount of $10,000, and arranged to pay the remainder\nthrough a Chapter 13 bankruptcy plan. Although he has only made payments through the plan for\nthree months, he had been paying down his debts for 16 months before he began making payments\nthrough the plan. Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions (FC MC) 20(b): the conditions that\nresulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment,\na business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce, or separation), and the\nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances, FC MC 20(c): the person has received or is\nreceiving counseling for the problem, and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being\nresolved or is under control, and FC MC (d): the creditor initiated a good-faith effort to repay\noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts, apply. Applicant has mitigated the financial\nconsiderations security concern.\nWhole Person Concept\nApplicant accrued a tremendous amount of delinquencies between 2001 and 2006. Although\nhe has been satisfying them for approximately 18 months, he continues to owe more than $50,000.\nNo record evidence exists that any of these debts originated from irresponsible spending. Instead,\nthey accrued from his inability to support himself because of a disabling on-the-job injury. Since\nreturning to work, his efforts at rehabilitating his finances have been exemplary, and his financial\nsituation appears to be well in control. These positive factors substantially outweigh the negative\nones. Evaluating this case in the context of the whole-person concept, I conclude that Applicant has\nmitigated the security concern. \n\n6\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nParagraph 1 \u2013 Guideline F:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a-1.n:\nFOR APPLICANT\nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. Clearance is\ngranted.\nMarc E. Curry\nAdministrative Judge\n",

    "summary": "FINDINGS OF FACT Applicant\u2019s admissions to the allegations in the SOR are incorporated herein. In addition, after a thorough review of the pleadings and exhibits, I make the following findings of fact: Applicant submitted a security clearance application in or about February 2006, which discloses she is 46 years old and has never been married. She did not list any dependents in the application nor has she indicated in any other submission that anyone is dependent upon her for support. Applicant was steadily employed from May 1984 until June 2000 as a senior accounting clerk in private industry. She left that position when her employer was sold to another company because she was concerned about the continued viability of her position with the employer.

The SOR, which is in essence the\n1\nadministrative complaint, alleges a security concern under Guideline F (financial considerations).\nApplicant submitted an undated response to the SOR that was apparently notarized on July 5, 2007.2\nShe admitted all SOR allegations, provided an explanation for her delinquent indebtedness, denied\nthe SOR allegations created a security concern, and requested a clearance decision based on the\nwritten record without a hearing.\nDepartment Counsel prepared a File of Relevant Material (FORM) on July 23, 2007, that was\nmailed to Applicant on July 26, 2007. Applicant acknowledged receipt of the FORM on July 31,\n2007, and did not object to the contents of the FORM or submit additional information for\nconsideration within the thirty-day time period allotted to her. The case was assigned to me on\nSeptember 28, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant\u2019s admissions to the allegations in the SOR are incorporated herein. In addition,\nafter a thorough review of the pleadings and exhibits, I make the following findings of fact:\nApplicant submitted a security clearance application in or about February 2006, which\ndiscloses she is 46 years old and has never been married. She did not list any dependents in the\napplication nor has she indicated in any other submission that anyone is dependent upon her for\nsupport. \nApplicant was steadily employed from May 1984 until June 2000 as a senior accounting clerk\nin private industry. She left that position when her employer was sold to another company because\nshe was concerned about the continued viability of her position with the employer. She thereafter\nwent through a succession of employers and two periods of unemployment until she again began\nemployment through a temporary agency in or about October 2003. While she is now steadily\nemployed, the record does not provide sufficient information from which the commencement date\nof that employment can be determined. She was unemployed from April to November 2001, and\nagain from June 2003 to February 2004. \nThe SOR lists four accounts, totaling $9,076.75, that were charged off as bad debts between\nDecember 2001 and May 2002; four accounts, totaling $11,820.46, that have been submitted for\ncollection; and one account, in the amount of $1,444.00, on which a judgment was entered against\nApplicant in August 2006. Although the two credit reports contained in the FORM do not\n\n It is clear from the credit reports that substantial amounts are owing to at least the majority of the listed\n3\ncreditors. The decision in this case is not dependent upon the exact amount owing and/or the total number of delinquent\ncreditors. \n3\ncompletely coincide with the amounts alleged to be owing in the SOR, Applicant admitted each of\nthe debts, including the amount owing, in her response to the SOR.3\nThere is no indication Applicant ever experienced any financial problems before she quit her\nlong term employment in June 2000. She attributes the financial delinquencies listed in the SOR to\nher subsequent periods of unemployment and the events of September 11, 2001, which made it\ndifficult for her to find suitable employment and necessitated a move to a different state. \nApplicant eventually moved in with her sister and indicates she hoped to be able to pay on\nher debts at that time with unemployment compensation she received. However, Applicant claims\nthat plan was unsuccessful because her sister insisted on being paid room and board. Further\npreventing her from making payments on the listed debts was approximately $7,000.00 in past due\ntaxes owed to the IRS. Applicant was able to satisfy the delinquent tax debt by mid-2004.      \nApplicant has sought advice from a debt counselor provided by her employer and two\nattorneys on how to get herself out of the financial hole she finds herself in. One attorney explained\nthe effect of statutes of limitations as they applied to her debts but offered no other advice. The\nsecond apparently suggested she seek bankruptcy protection. She also contacted a consumer credit\ncounseling service that was unable to assist her because at the time she did not have steady\nemployment. There is no indication in the FORM she has contacted any creditor to attempt to set up\npayment plans on the debts or taken any other affirmative step to resolve any of the debts listed in\nthe SOR.\n  \nPOLICIES\nThe Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when evaluating a person\u2019s\neligibility to hold a security clearance. Chief among them are the disqualifying conditions and\nmitigating conditions for each applicable guideline. Additionally, each clearance decision must be\na fair and impartial commonsense decision based upon the relevant and material facts and\ncircumstances, the whole person concept, and the factors listed in \u00b6 6.3.1 through \u00b6 6.3.6 of the\nDirective. Although the presence or absence of a particular condition or factor for or against\nclearance is not outcome determinative, the adjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever\na case can be measured against this policy guidance. Considering the evidence as a whole, Guideline\nF, pertaining to financial considerations is most relevant in this case.   \n\n ISCR Case No. 96-0277 (July 11, 1997) at p. 2.\n4\n ISCR Case No. 97-0016 (December 31, 1997) at p. 3; Directive, Enclosure 3, Item E3.1.14. \n5\n Department of the Navy v.

The government has\n4\nthe burden of proving controverted facts.  The burden of proof in a security clearance case is\n5\nsomething less than a preponderance of evidence , although the government is required to present\n6\nsubstantial evidence to meet its burden of proof.  \u201cSubstantial evidence is more than a scintilla, but\n7\nless than a preponderance of the evidence.\u201d  Once the government has met its burden, the burden\n8\nshifts to an applicant to present evidence of refutation, extenuation, or mitigation to overcome the\ncase against him.  Additionally, an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a\n9\nfavorable clearance decision.10\nNo one has a right to a security clearance  and \u201cthe clearly consistent standard indicates that\n11\nsecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d   Any reasonable\n12\ndoubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified information must be\nresolved in favor of protecting national security.      \n13\nCONCLUSIONS\nUnder Guideline F, a security concern exists when a person has significant unpaid debts.\nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor\nself-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can\nraise questions about and individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified\ninformation. An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal\nacts to generate funds.\n\n5\nAs alleged in the SOR, and evidenced by Applicant\u2019s admissions and credit reports,\nApplicant allowed numerous accounts, totaling approximately $20,000.00, to be charged off as bad\ndebts, submitted for collection, or result in a judgment entered against her. All of those accounts\nremain delinquent and Applicant has failed to take any affirmative step other than to make inquiries\nof attorneys and debt counselors to resolve any of the accounts. Disqualifying Conditions (DC)\n19(a): inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and 19(b) a history of not meeting financial\nobligations apply.\nThe evidence clearly indicates Applicant\u2019s financial problems arose from her decision to seek\nnew employment when the company where she had worked for many years was sold, the resulting\nperiods of unemployment she experienced, the difficulty she had in finding suitable employment\nbecause of the events of September 11, 2001, and the unexpected tax delinquencies she incurred.\nWhen she then found herself unable to manage her finances she sought to mitigate the problem by\nmoving in with her sister and to a state where she hoped to better be able to find suitable\nemployment. Mitigating Condition 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were\nlargely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected\nmedical emergency, or a divorce, death, or separation), and the individual acted responsibly under\nthe circumstances applies.\nHowever, her financial problems are ongoing. Applicant is nowhere near having her financial\nproblems under control. She has not initiated any effort to repay any of the listed delinquent\ncreditors, nor has she indicated she has any basis to dispute the legitimacy of any of the debts other\nthan to possibly being able to rely on statutes of limitation. Accordingly, none of the remaining\npotentially mitigating conditions apply.\nMost troubling about Applicant\u2019s assertion that her financial problems do not create a\nsecurity concern is her complete lack of effort to resolve any of the debts since being informed of\ntheir potential security significance. Although she was gainfully employed for at least some period\nof time before issuance of the SOR, was able to resolve her tax delinquencies over three years ago,\nand has no one dependent on her for support, Applicant has failed to make a single payment on any\nof the listed debts or even asserted that she contacted any of the creditors to attempt to work out a\nrepayment plan. While she claims to have contacted two attorneys and two debt counselors to seek\nadvice, she has not followed through on whatever recommendations she may have received from\nthem to take affirmative steps to resolve the debts. As a result, it is impossible to say that her\nfinancials problems are behind her or they are likely to be resolved in the foreseeable future.  \nThe objective of the security-clearance process is the fair-minded, commonsense assessment\nof a person\u2019s trustworthiness and fitness for access to classified information. Indeed, the \u201cwhole\nperson\u201d concept recognizes we should view a person by the totality of their acts and omissions. Each\ncase must be adjudged on its own merits, taking into consideration all relevant circumstances, and\napplying sound judgment, mature thinking, and careful analysis. Having done so, I conclude\nApplicant has failed to present sufficient evidence of refutation, extenuation, and mitigation to\novercome the case against her. Accordingly, Guideline F is decided against Applicant.  \nFORMAL FINDINGS\n\n6\nSOR \u00b6 1-Guideline F:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraphs a-i:\nAgainst Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.

Under a plea agreement negotiated in August 2009, the\nstate nolle prossed the charges of crimes against nature, and reduced the remaining\ncharges to four misdemeanor counts of contributing to the delinquency of a minor.\nApplicant pleaded no contest to these reduced charges, and the court, after considering\nthe evidence, found him guilty, imposing a jail term of 12 months suspended on each\ncharge, respectively. Because the court\u2019s final disposition of the case is still pending,\nApplicant is an unacceptable candidate for a security clearance. Clearance is denied.\nStatement of the Case\nOn April 30, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing a security concern under Guideline\nJ, Criminal Conduct. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nNovember 13, 2009\n\n2\nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative\nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective\nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \nApplicant answered the SOR on December 27, 2008, admitting the allegation, in\npart, and requested a hearing. The case was assigned to me on August 12, 2009. On\nAugust 31, 2009, a notice of hearing was issued scheduling the case for September 17,\n2009. The hearing was conducted as scheduled. I received eight government exhibits,\ntwo Applicant exhibits, and the testimony of two Applicant witnesses. Also, at\nDepartment Counsel\u2019s request, I took administrative notice of four sections of relevant\nstate law. At the conclusion of the hearing, I left the record open to allow both parties to\nsubmit additional exhibits. Within the time allotted, Department Counsel submitted\nanother exhibit that I marked and received as Exhibit 9, and Applicant submitted\nanother exhibit that I marked and received  as Exhibit C. The transcript was received on\nSeptember 24, 2009.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 49-year-old married man. He has a GED, and served in the U.S.\nNavy from 1980 through his retirement in 2004 (Tr. 18). He spent the majority of his\ncareer working on submarines (Tr. 76). Currently, he works for a defense contractor as\nan engineer. He helps maintain sonar and tactical control systems on submarines\n(Exhibit A). According to his supervisor, he is a \u201chardworking and meticulous\u201d worker\nwho mentors junior employees and fosters a collaborative team environment (Id.). \nApplicant was married twice previously. His first marriage ended in divorce in\n1987. He remarried in 1989. This marriage ended with the death of his wife in 2000\n(Exhibit 2 at 3). He has three daughters, ages 22, 20, and 17. All are from his second\nmarriage (Tr. 19). His oldest daughter is adopted. She is the natural-born daughter of\nhis second wife and a former boyfriend. Applicant adopted her in 1992, when she was\nfive years old (Tr. 52). In 1999, Applicant and his second wife separated (Exhibit 4 at 3).\nThe children remained with her (Id.).\nIn 2000, while the divorce proceedings were pending, Applicant\u2019s wife was\nmurdered. Applicant\u2019s daughters then moved in with him (Tr. 22). Because of the\ntraumatic nature of his wife\u2019s death, Applicant enrolled his daughters in therapy (Tr. 84 -\n86). The adopted daughter had stopped attending therapy by the time she had reached\nhigh school (Tr. 86). It is unclear from the record exactly how long each daughter was in\ntherapy. \nApplicant was single when his daughters moved in with him. Because he spent \u201ca\nsubstantial amount of time out at sea\u201d his stepdaughter from his first marriage who was\nin her late teens at the time, helped him raise the girls when he was away from home\n(Tr. 23). Shortly before retiring from the Navy, Applicant began dating a woman to\n\n3\nwhom he later became engaged. Although this relationship ultimately failed, she also\nwatched the children when he was out to sea (Tr. 23). \nIn the fall of 2004, Applicant\u2019s adopted daughter moved out of his home to live\nwith her boyfriend (Tr. 24). In the fall of 2005, Applicant became engaged to his current\nwife (Tr. 28). In February 2006, they married. She and her teenage son then moved in\nwith Applicant and his youngest daughters. (Id.). \nNone of the new family members got along with one another (Tr. 29-31).\nApplicant\u2019s daughters accused the stepson of vandalizing their property, and they\naccused their stepmother of being emotionally abusive (Tr. 30). Frequent and\nincreasingly intense verbal arguments ensued. As the situation worsened, Applicant\nbegan discovering that \u201creally strange things [were] taking place in the house,\u201d such as\nthe kitchen being ransacked, and furniture being vandalized (Tr. 31). \nApplicant initially attributed the problems to his wife and stepson. Some time\nduring the spring of 2006, Applicant\u2019s daughters moved in with their older sister at his\nsuggestion (Tr. 34). Applicant and his wife then attended marital counseling (Tr. 35). \nIn May 2006, Applicant, at his wife\u2019s suggestion, underwent marital counseling\n(Tr. 37). The counselor suggested that his two youngest daughters return to his home\nand participate jointly in counseling (Tr. 37). Although they returned and participated in\ncounseling, they remained hostile, and requested to return to live with their older sister\n(Tr. 38). By June 2006, the oldest daughter, who also had a bad relationship with the\nstepmother, began calling the home daily, demanding to see her sisters and threatening\nthe stepmother (Tr. 39).\nOn or about June 10, 2006, Applicant\u2019s daughters\u2019 maternal grandparents visited\nfrom out of town to attend the middle daughter\u2019s middle school graduation (Tr. 41). The\ngrandparents asked Applicant to transfer custody of the girls to them (Tr. 42). Applicant\nrefused. Shortly thereafter, the two younger daughters alleged that Applicant had\nsexually molested them (Tr. 44; Exhibit 4 at 9). \nApplicant was then arrested (Id.). The specific charges are unknown from the\nrecord. He was released after posting bond (Id.). He transferred custody to the girls\u2019\ngrandparents while the local department of social services investigated the complaint\n(Id.). Currently, the girls remain in their grandparents\u2019 custody.\nOn August 2, 2006, \u201cafter a thorough evaluation,\u201d the local social services\ndepartment completed the investigation and concluded that the complaint was\nunfounded (Exhibit 4 at 11). \nApproximately three weeks later on August 25, 2006, Applicant\u2019s adopted\ndaughter accused him of molesting her approximately two days per month from 1995 to\n2004 (Exhibit 5 at 2). That day, the magistrate issued an arrest warrant. Referencing an\narcane, Jim-Crow era state statute that has long been amended, the magistrate\n\nIn citing this portion of the arrest warrant, I copied the magistrate\u2019s language exactly as it appeared on the\n1\narrest warrant including the use of all capital letters for the phrase \u201ca white female.\u201d\nUnder 16.1-228, \u201cabused or neglected\u201d means any child \u201cwhose parents . . . create or inflict, threaten to\n2\ncreate or inflict, or allow to be created or inflicted upon such child a physical or mental injury by other than\naccidental means . . .\u201d\n4\ncharged Applicant with committing \u201cforcible sodomy by engaging in cunnilingus with A\nWHITE FEMALE  when such act was accomplished against the victim\u2019s will, by force,\n1\nthreat, or intimidation of or against the victim or another person\u201d (Exhibit 5 at 3).\nApplicant is African-American. Applicant was arrested and incarcerated for ten days\nbefore posting bond of $16,000 (Exhibit 5 at 16; Exhibit 6 at 1; Tr. 58).\nShortly after Applicant\u2019s arrest, the prosecution amended the charge striking the\nreference to the race of the victim (Exhibit 5 at 4). On November 13, 2006, a grand jury\nindicted Applicant charging him with four felony counts of crimes against nature and four\nfelony counts of indecent liberties under \u00a718.2 of the state\u2019s criminal code (see\ngenerally, Exhibit 5; Exhibit C at 2). The abuse allegations alleged in the charging\ndocuments were limited to 2000 through 2004, the period that the alleged abuse\noccurred within the court\u2019s jurisdiction.\nIn December 2006, the adopted daughter attempted to break into Applicant\u2019s\nhouse (Tr. 81). Subsequently, he obtained a temporary restraining order against her (Tr.\n82).\nApproximately six years before Applicant\u2019s daughter alleged that he molested\nher, she alleged that someone had raped her (Tr. 84). In response, Applicant enrolled\nher in therapy. During therapy, she recanted the rape allegations (Tr. 85).\nIn August 2009, the state and Applicant negotiated a plea bargain. Under the\nagreement, the four felony counts of crimes against nature were nolle prossed, and the\nfour felony indecent liberty counts were reduced to four misdemeanor counts of\ncontributing to the delinquency of a minor under \u00a7 18.2-371 of the state code, which\nstates as follows:\nAny person 18 years of age or older, including the parent of any child, who\n(i) willfully contributes to, encourages, or causes any act, omission or\ncondition which renders a child delinquent, in need of services, in need of\nsupervision, or abused or neglected as defined in \u00a7 16.1-228,  or (ii)\n2\nengages in consensual sexual intercourse with a child 15 or older not his\nspouse, child, or grandchild, shall be guilty of a Class 1 misdemeanor.\nApplicant pleaded not guilty to the reduced charges, but stipulated that the evidence if\nheard would be sufficient to convict him of the four misdemeanors (Exhibit 8). The state\ndid not require his plea to specifically address the section of the misdemeanor code\ninvolving sex with minors (Exhibit 9).\n   \n\n5\nSubsequently, the court sentenced Applicant to 12 months in jail for each charge,\nsuspended (Exhibit 8; Tr. 71). Applicant was also ordered to complete a psychological\nevaluation and to have no contact with his adopted daughter. The psychological\nevaluation is scheduled for December 2009, and Applicant is to comply with any\nrecommendations of the psychologist and report the findings to the court (Tr. 73). If\nApplicant fails to follow any of the court-ordered requirements over the next five years,\nor engages in any other criminal conduct during this period, the court may lift the\nsuspension, and require him to serve jail time (Tr. 73).\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a\nconscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d\nThe administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the\nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision.\nAnalysis\nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct\nUnder this guideline, \u201ccriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment,\nreliability, and trustworthiness\u201d (AG \u00b6 30). Also, \u201cby its very nature, it calls into question\na person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations\u201d (Id.).\nApplicant was charged with four felony counts of crimes against nature and four\nfelony counts of indecent liberties after his oldest daughter accused him of molesting\nher on multiple occasions over a ten-year period. Approximately six years earlier,\n\nSee ISCR Case No. 04-05712 (App. Board, October 31, 2006) at 7.\n3\n6\nApplicant\u2019s daughter alleged she had been raped, then recanted while in therapy that\nApplicant had arranged. \nApplicant persuasively testified to a severely troubled relationship between his\nchildren, his wife, and new stepson. His two youngest daughters did not accuse him of\nmolestation until after he had reached the conclusion that they, not their step-family\nmembers, were the principal source of the family\u2019s discord, and his oldest daughter did\nnot accuse him of molestation until the local child protective services agency\ninvestigated and dismissed the youngest daughters\u2019 allegations. Applicant has readily\nenrolled his daughters in therapy throughout their childhood, including after the death of\ntheir mother, after the oldest daughter\u2019s earlier rape allegation, and after he married his\ncurrent wife.\nNevertheless, Applicant pleaded no contest to four misdemeanor counts of\ncontributing to the delinquency of a minor. The court then sentenced him to a year in\nprison for each count, suspended, ordered that he have no contact with his oldest\ndaughter, and ordered him to undergo a psychological evaluation. After he completes\nthe evaluation, the court will order any of the psychologist\u2019s recommendations. If\nApplicant violates any terms of this order, the court may lift the suspension. AG \u00b6\u00b6 31(a)\n\u201cmultiple lesser offenses,\u201d and 31(d), \u201cthe individual is currently on parole or probation,\napply.\u201d\nBecause Applicant pleaded no contest to misdemeanors rather than felonies, the\ndoctrine of collateral estoppel does not preclude me from weighing the credibility of the\nevidence underlying the misdemeanor charges.  However, any exculpatory evidence is\n3\noutweighed by Applicant\u2019s plea admission that the state possessed enough evidence to\nhave convicted him of the underlying misdemeanors if the matter had been tried. \nApplicant\u2019s plea occurred less than a month before the ISCR hearing. He is still\nawaiting the results of a psychological evaluation, scheduled for December 2009, so\nthat it can supplement its order with any of the psychologist\u2019s recommendations.\nConsequently, it is too soon to conclude that AG \u00b6 32(d), \u201cthere is evidence of\nsuccessful rehabilitation; including but not limited to the passage of time without\nrecurrence of criminal activity, remorse or restitution, job training or higher education,\ngood employment record, or constructive community involvement,\u201d applies.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\n\n7\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which\nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for\npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or\nrecurrence.\u201d\nApplicant\u2019s two younger daughters were minors who were in his legal custody\nwhen they accused him of molesting them. The conduct allegedly occurred\ncontemporaneously when they were living with Applicant under his custody. Conversely,\nthe older sister did not file her complaint until two years after the alleged conduct\noccurred, and she had recanted a similar allegation against another alleged assailant in\nthe past. \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------. \nThe \nstate \nchild\nprotective services dismissed the younger girls\u2019 allegations after a three-week\ninvestigation, whereas, the oldest child\u2019s allegations prompted a three-year effort to\nprosecute Applicant. \nThese facts, together with the arrest warrant that initially charged Applicant under\nan invalid, Jim-Crow era statute, raise serious concerns about the motivation of the\nprosecution in Applicant\u2019s case. Regardless of the prosecution\u2019s motivation, Applicant\npleaded no contest to reduced charges so recently that the court-ordered psychological\nevaluation has yet to occur. Also, Applicant\u2019s ISCR hearing testimony revealed\nprofound, unresolved family dysfunction. So long as he is under unsupervised probation\nand the family dysfunction is unresolved, he remains vulnerable to coercion. I conclude\nApplicant is an unacceptable candidate for a security clearance. Clearance is denied.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline J:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\n\n8\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n                                             \nMARC E. CURRY\nAdministrative Judge\n",

HEINY\nAPPEARANCES\nFOR GOVERNMENT\nRita C. O\u2019Brien, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nSYNOPSIS\nApplicant\u2019s owed approximately $21,000. Excluding her student loans ($9,965) and a vehicle\nrepossession ($7,000), Applicant owes approximately $2,700. Applicant is making an effort to repay\nher debts with the limited funds at her disposal. The record evidence is sufficient to mitigate or\nextenuate the negative security implications stemming from this debt. Eligibility for ADP-I/II/III\nposition is granted.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn June 6, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement\nof Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, detailing the basis for its decision to deny an application to occupy\na Public Trust Position designated ADP I/II/III for Applicant. The action was taken under\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive).  Applicant challenges the SOR recommending\n\n2\ndenial or revocation of his trustworthiness determination because of financial considerations\nconcerns. \nOn July 5, 2007, Applicant answered the SOR and elected to have the matter decided without\na hearing. Department Counsel submitted the government\u2019s case in a File of Relevant Material\n(FORM), dated August 15, 2007. Applicant was sent a copy of the FORM, along with notice of her\nopportunity to file objections and submit material to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the potentially\ndisqualifying conditions. On September 24, 2007, Applicant responded to the FORM.  Department\nCounsel did not object to the material. Applicant\u2019s response was admitted into the record. On\nOctober 5, 2007, I was assigned the case. \nFINDINGS OF FACT\nThe SOR alleges concerns based on financial considerations. Applicant\u2019s jewelry store debt\n(SOR 1.a and 1. g) have been paid.  She admits owing the other nine bills and states payment on her\nstudent loans (approximately $10,000)have been deferred until 2010. The admissions are\nincorporated herein as findings of fact. After a thorough review of the record, I make the following\nfindings of fact.\nApplicant is a 26-year-old technical support technician who has worked for a defense\ncontractor since May 2005, and is seeking a position of public trust.\nIn 1998, Applicant obtained a student loan to attend university.  After one semester, she left\nschool because the tuition was too expensive and her mother was gravely ill with cancer. In 1999,\nshe obtained a student loan to attend technical college.  She has repaid a portion of that debt and the\nrest was deferred.  She graduated from the technical college in 1999. In 2006, she obtained a student\nloan to attend university.  That loan is deferred until 2010. Applicant is working with the Federal\nDirect Consolidation Loan Company to consolidate all of her student loans. (Item 5) Applicant has\nnot received any undue pressure from the creditor to collect this debt. \nIn December 1999, Applicant received an automobile loan with monthly payment of $298.\n(Item 6) As of April 2003, she had been 30 days past due on her payments five times, and more than\n90 days past due once.  Her income was insufficient for her to make payments and the vehicle was\nrepossessed.  At some time, the car company obtained a judgment. (Item 7) When this occurred or\nthe amount of the judgment is not part of the record. Applicant acknowledges she owes $7,000, and\nwill pay it after she has satisfied the other debts. \nUntil the end of 2006, Applicant\u2019s income was insufficient for her to make payment on her\npast due obligations. For some time, her debts exceeded her take-home pay. In her response to the\nFORM, Applicant acknowledged that at an early age she \u201cgot in over my head. I was living for the\nmoment\u201d and living beyond her means. She intends to pay her debts when her finances permit. In\nAugust 2007, she obtained a part-time job to help supplement her income from her full time job. She\nhas obtained financial counseling through her job\u2019s EAP program.\nThe jewelry debt, which is listed twice (SOR 1.a and 1.g) has been paid.  She has made $100\npayment on the two medical bills (SOR 1.c, $50, and SOR 1.i, $75).  Applicant is also paying debts\nnot listed in the SOR. \n\n3\nApplicant financially assists her mother.

Administrative judges must assess both\ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions under each adjudicative issue fairly raised by the facts and\ncircumstances presented. Each decision must also reflect a fair and impartial common sense\nconsideration of the factors listed in Section 6.3 of the Directive. The presence or absence of a\ndisqualifying or mitigating condition is not determinative for or against an applicant. However,\nspecific adjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against them,\n\nSee, Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988).\n1\n4\nas they represent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to classified information.\nConsideration the SOR allegations and the evidence as a whole, the relevant, applicable,\nadjudicative guideline is Guideline F (Financial Considerations).\nPublic trust determinations resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest\nto grant or continue an applicant\u2019s eligibility for public trust positions.  The government must prove,\nby something less than a preponderance of the evidence, controverted facts alleged in the SOR.  If\nit does so, it establishes a prima facie case against eligibility.  Applicant must then refute, extenuate,\nor mitigate the government\u2019s concern. Because no one has a right to eligibility for a position of trust,\nthe applicant bears a heavy burden of persuasion. \nPersons with access to public trust information enter into a fiduciary relationship with the\ngovernment based on trust and confidence.  Therefore, the government has a compelling interest in\nensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness of those\nwho must protect the national interest as their own.  The\u201dclearly consistent with the national\ninterest\u201d standard compels resolution of any reasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for\naccess in favor of the government.1\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe Government has satisfied its initial burden of proof under Guideline F, Financial\nConsiderations. A person\u2019s relationship with her creditors is a private matter until evidence is\nuncovered demonstrating an inability or unwillingness to repay debts under agreed upon terms.\nAbsent evidence of strong extenuating or mitigating circumstances, an applicant with a history of\nserious or recurring financial difficulties is in a position of risk that is inconsistent with the holding\nof a security clearance. An applicant is not required to be debt-free, but is required to manage his\nfinances so as to meet his financial obligations.\nFinancial considerations become a security concern when a person has significant delinquent\ndebts. An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal or\nunethical acts to generate funds to meet financial obligations. Additionally, an individual who is\nfinancially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, unconcerned, or careless in their obligations to\nprotect classified information.  Behaving responsibly or irresponsibly in one aspect of life provides\nan indication of how a person may behave in other aspects of life. \nApplicant owed approximately $21,000 on 11 delinquent debts.  Disqualifying Conditions\n(DC) 19(a) \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts,\u201d and 19(c) \u201ca history of not meeting financial\nobligations\u201d apply. \nApplicant\u2019s debt does not show an individual living beyond their means.  Applicant\u2019s debt\nless vehicle debt, student loan obligations, and debts paid is approximately $2,700. Other than the\ncar debt and student loans, her unpaid debt consists of telephone bills and a single credit card debt\n(SOR 1.b). Mitigating Condition MC 20(d) \u201cthe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay\noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts,\u201d applies to the jewelry store and the medical debts.\n\n5\nApplicant\u2019s largest debt, her student loans, has been consolidated.  This debt does not show\nan individual living beyond her means.  It shows a person trying to better themselves.  When tuition\nwas too high at one university, Applicant left and attended technical college. The student loan debt\nwas incurred to improve her life.  It is unlikely the holders of the student loans would bring undue\nmethods to collect this debt.  It would be unusual for someone to engage in illegal or unethical acts\nto generate funds to pay a student loan debt.   The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress by the creditor to collect a student loan is non existent. Excluding the student loan obligation,\nApplicant\u2019s debt is not so large she is financially overextended.\nMC 20(b) \u201cthe conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the\nperson\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency,\nor a death, divorce or separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances,\u201d\nhas some applicability.  Applicant is helping to take care of her mother who suffers from cancer.\nApplicant has obtained financial counseling through her job. \nUntil the end of 2006, Applicant\u2019s income was insufficient for her to make payment on her\npast due obligations. Applicant intends to pay her debts when her finances permit. She is paying\nobligations not listed in the SOR and helping to support her mother. The debts she has already paid,\nthose she is paying, and the support she gives to her mother lends credence to her claim that she will\nultimately pay her debts. This is also supported by her obtaining a part-time job in August 2007 to\nsupplement her income. Applicant appears to be doing what she can with the funds she has\navailable.  Applicant is not highly paid in her position as a technical support technician. \nIn addition to the adjudicative guideline cited, consideration should be given to information\nbearing on the whole person.  The adjudicative process must include examination of a sufficient\nperiod of a person\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the person is an acceptable\nsecurity risk.  Therefore, I have also considered: the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct;\nApplicant\u2019s age (now age 26) and maturity at the time of the conduct; the circumstances surrounding\nthe conduct; Applicant\u2019s voluntary and knowledgeable participation; the motivation for the conduct;\nthe frequency and recency of the conduct; presence or absence of rehabilitation (she has taken a part-\ntime job to supplement her income); and the probability that the circumstance or conduct will\ncontinue or recur in the future. \nLooking at the nature of her debts, the debts she has paid, and the amount she owes, the\nrecord before me support a conclusion Applicant has mitigated the security concerns. \nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal Findings as required by Section 3, Paragraph 7, of Enclosure 1 of the Directive are\nhereby rendered as follows:\nParagraph 1 Financial Considerations: \nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a-j:\nFor Applicant\nDECISION\n\n6\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. Clearance is\ngranted.\nClaude R. Heiny \nAdministrative Judge\n",

Applicant requested a hearing.  On November 25, 2008, after the hearing,\nAdministrative Judge Darlene D. Lokey Anderson denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security\nclearance.  Applicant filed a timely appeal pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether the record establishes security\nconcerns under Guideline E; whether the Judge\u2019s application of the Guideline E mitigating\nconditions is erroneous; and whether the Judge\u2019s whole-person analysis is erroneous.   Finding no\n1\nerror, we affirm.  \nThe Judge made the following pertinent findings of fact: Applicant was born in Lebanon to\na U.S. mother and a Lebanese father, who later became a U.S. citizen.  Her family moved from\nLebanon to the United Kingdom when Applicant was a child.  Due to her education and upbringing,\nApplicant learned to speak Arabic, French, and English while a child.

Apr. 12,\n2005).  In evaluating an applicant\u2019s state of mind, the Judge must examine the omissions or false\nstatements in light of the entirety of the record evidence.  See ISCR Case No. 04-09429 at 3 (App.\nBd.

She also considered Applicant\u2019s various explanations for the omissions, concluding\nthat \u201cnone of her explanations for failing to answer the questions accurately are reasonable or even\ncomprehensible.\u201d  Id. at 8.  The Board concludes that the Judge\u2019s finding that Applicant\u2019s omissions\nwere deliberate is supported by substantial record evidence.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1.  (Substantial\nevidence is \u201csuch relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a\nconclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the same record.\u201d)  \nApplicant takes issue with the Judge\u2019s weighing of certain pieces of evidence, e.g., that\nApplicant had received no help in filling out the forms in question and that she had no prior\nexperience in applying for a security clearance.  However, a Judge is presumed to have considered\nall the evidence in the record unless she specifically states otherwise.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 07-\n00553 at 2 (App. Bd. May 23, 2008).  \u201cAn applicant\u2019s disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of\nthe evidence, or an ability to argue for a different interpretation of the evidence, is not sufficient to\ndemonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence or reached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.\u201d  See  ISCR Case No. 07-10454 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 12, 2008).  The\nrecord demonstrates that the Judge considered appropriate mitigating conditions, holding in favor\nof Applicant as to Guideline B.  However, she concluded that Applicant had failed to meet her\nburden of persuasion under Guideline E.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  Viewed in light of the record as\na whole, the Judge\u2019s adverse conclusion concerning mitigation is sustainable.  The Judge\u2019s whole-\nperson analysis is also sustainable.

This case was assigned to the undersigned on\nJuly 22, 2008.  A notice of hearing was issued on September 15, 2008, scheduling the\nhearing for October 20, 2008.  At the hearing the Government presented seven exhibits,\nreferred to as Government Exhibits 1 through 7.

She is seeking to obtain a security clearance in\nconnection with her employment.  \nThe Government opposes the Applicant's request for a security clearance, on the\nbasis of allegations set forth in the Statement of Reasons (SOR).  After a complete and\nthorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of the same,\nthe following findings of fact are entered as to each paragraph and guideline in the\nSOR:\nParagraph 1 (Guideline B - Foreign Influence)  The Government alleges in this\nparagraph that the Applicant is ineligible for clearance because she has foreign contacts\nthat could create the potential for foreign influence that could result in the compromise\nof classified information.  The Applicant admits all of the allegations set forth under this\nguideline, except 1(c)  in the SOR.    \nThe Applicant was born in Beruit, Lebanon in 1966, to an American Catholic\nmother and a Lebanese father.  For some unknown reason, her birth was never\nregistered as Lebanese.  She was registered at birth at the American Embassy, and\nwas issued a United States passport.  She spent her first eight or nine years in Lebanon\nand learned to speak Arabic.  She attended a French speaking Catholic grade school,\nso she also learned to speak French.  In 1975, when the war started in Lebanon, the\nApplicant, who was nine years old at the time, left Lebanon with her mother and\nsiblings, and moved to London, England.  Her mother primarily raised her.  Her parents\nspoke English to her and so she learned to speak English.  When she was sixteen, her\nparents separated and later divorced.  At the age of twenty, the Applicant moved from\nLondon to the United States to complete college.\nIn 2001, the Applicant and her brother started Company A in the United States.\nThe original purpose of the company was to engage in international trading with the\nMiddle East.  However, after Applicant\u2019s father wrote a white paper that won a contract\n\n3\nwith the Defense Department, in May 2004, Applicant\u2019s father began working as a\nconsultant for his daughter\u2019s (the Applicant\u2019s) company.  Applicant\u2019s father, who is a dual\ncitizen of Lebanon and the United States, and was residing in Lebanon at the time, had\nno company to implement the defense contract in the United States, and so he utilized\nthe Applicant\u2019s company.  (See Applicant\u2019s Exhibit B).  Applicant\u2019s father was a\nconsultant for the Applicant\u2019s company from May 2004 through February 2006, and\nSeptember 2006 through May 2007.  Applicant indicates that her father moved to Iraq for\ntwo years to help the United States military.  In May 2007, Applicant fired her father as a\nconsultant for her company, for failing to comply with her companies rules and\nregulations.  She gave him several warnings, but they were not effective.  She explained\nthat she and her father had big disagreements on how to conduct company business\nmatters.  (Tr. pp 66-67).   \n  \nIn 2005, the Applicant\u2019s company was sponsored by Company B, and awarded\nthe Government contract discussed above.  Applicant had to obtain a security clearance\nto satisfy the contract requirements.  The Applicant obtained her secret level security\nclearance, and in 2006, she became the Facility Security Officer (FSO) of her company.\nShe took an on line training course to be the FSO.  As the company grew, she assigned\nthat responsibility to someone else.  She is currently applying for a Top Secret level\nclearance because they have recently won a contract at that level.  In addition to her\nsecurity clearance, her company also needs a facility security clearance.  This required\nthat she restructure the company and hire a new President who has Top Secret SCI\nAccess and top level Ex-Military people to head various departments to comply with\nUnited States Government requirements. \nApplicant offers that all of the subcontractors used by the Applicant in furtherance\nof their government contract had to be approved by the United States military.\nConcerning this topic, her attorney asked, \u201cAnd the foreign subcontractors that\n[Applicant\u2019s company] has worked with, I think what you\u2019re telling me is that those have\nall been identified routinely to the prime contractor who, in turn, reveals them to the U.S.\nIs that your - -\u201c.  Applicant responded, \u201cCorrect.  Those subcontractors are mostly when\nwe - - my brother and I - - the Government asks us can you put together a term of\nexperts on the Middle East to do a pubic diplomacy, and we knew the owners of [name\nredacted] and [name redacted] and some other - - another company [name redacted]\nthat was actually owned by a friend of my brother\u2019s from Boston College.  He\u2019s an\nAmerican and he started this Iraqi company to help radios put - - basically create a radio\nstation - - to help get news to military there and some other things.\u201d  (Tr. pp. 78-79).\nApplicant further indicates that the United States is currently trying to improve its\neconomic developments in Iraq and are requiring some of the United States contractors\nto own a company in Iraq and hire Iraqi local nationals to assist on the contract.  Her\ncompany recently started the process of having a business license in Iraq in order to\nmeet the requirements of the contract her company is now bidding for.  (Tr. p. 72).       \nApplicant discusses allegations 1(b) and 1(c), regarding her father\u2019s involvement\nin Lebanonese internal affairs.  (See Government Exhibit 6, and  Tr. p. 69).  She loves\nher father, but does not feel close to him at the present time.  She last spoke to him in\nthe summer of 2007, when she saw him at her brother\u2019s wedding.  (Tr. p. 66).\n\n4\nThe Applicant traveled to Lebanon in 2000, 2001, 2003, and 2005 for pleasure.  In\n2005, she also conducted some business matters.  She has family in Lebanon that\ninclude her father\u2019s cousins, but she is not close to them.  Her two sisters live in the\nUnited States.  She states that she has a tender heart for a place that she remembers\nwhich is not the place that Lebanon is today.  She has no financial assets in Lebanon\nand does not stand to inherit anything there based upon her cultural traditions.  \nParagraph 2 (Guideline E - Personal Conduct).  The Government alleges that the\nApplicant is ineligible for a security clearance because he intentionally falsified material\naspects of her personal background during the employment process.\nThe Applicant denies the allegations set forth under this guideline.\nThe Applicant completed a Certificate Pertaining to Foreign Interests (Standard\nForm 328)  dated November 4, 2005.  Question 5 asked the Applicant, \u201cDoes your\norganization have any contracts, agreements, understanding, or arrangements with a\nforeign person(s)?\u201d  The Applicant answered, \u201cNO\u201d.  (See Government Exhibit 2).  This\nwas a  false response.  The Applicant failed to disclose her contracts with her father, a\ncitizen and resident of Lebanon, and companies in which her father had an interest. \nThe Applicant offers a number of explanations as to why she did not answer the\nquestion accurately.  She explained that she did not consider her father a foreign person\nbecause he is also a United States citizen.   (Tr. p. 85).  She also thought the question\nwas asking her if she had any foreign interest in something.  (Tr. p. 75).  She contends\nthat she had no reason to hide any of the subcontractors that her company works with\nbecause she previously disclosed this information on other Government documents.\nShe saw no printed instructions on how to fill out the form.  (Tr. p. 123).  She also\nbelieves that she originally filled out the form in May 2005, and at that time she had not\nyet hired the foreign subcontractors.  (Tr. pp. 81-82).  She remembers being\noverwhelmed when she filled out the  application.  (Tr. p. 124).  \nThe Applicant completed a Security Clearance Questionnaire dated February 4,\n2006. Question 12 asked the Applicant, \u201cDo you have any foreign property, business\nconnections, or financial interest?  The Applicant answered, \u201cNO\u201d.  (See Government\nExhibit 3).  This was a false answer.  The Applicant failed to disclose her business\nconnections that include her father, a citizen and resident of Lebanon, companies in\nwhich her father had an interest, and foreign subcontractors.  \nShe explained that she took the question to be asking whether she owns foreign\nproperty.  (Tr. p. 140).  She did not consider any of the foreign subcontractors to fit into\nthat category.  She further contends that she did not have foreign subcontracting\ncompanies affiliated with her company until November 2005, and that she originally\nsigned the form in March 2005.  Her signature reflects the date of February 4, 2006.  She\nalso adds that she had no instructions on how to properly answer the questions. \n     \nLebanon is a parliamentary republic and has been in a state of war with Israel\nsince 1973.  Lebanon\u2019s foreign policy has been heavily influenced by neighboring Syria,\nwhich has also long influenced Lebanon\u2019s internal policies as well.  Syria, which has\nbeen designated by the Secretary of State as a State Sponsor of Terrorism provides\n\n5\n\u201cpolitical and material support to Hiszballah.\u201d  Hiszballah remains the most prominent\nterrorist group in Lebanon and has a strong influence among Lebanon\u2019s Shia community\nwhich comprises about one-third of Lebanon\u2019s population.  According to the most recent\nU.S. Department of State report on Human Rights Practices, Lebanonese security forces\narbitrarily arrested and detained individual, and there were instances of arbitrary or\nunlawful deprivation of life, torture and other abuse.  Militias and non-Lebanese forces\noperating outside of the area of Lebanon\u2019s central government authority frequently\nviolated citizens\u2019 privacy rights and various factions used informer networks and\nmonitoring of telephones to obtain information regarding their perceived adversaries.\nThe U.S. Department of State continues to strongly urge that Americans defer travel to\nLebanon and that the U.S. remains concerned about the threat of terrorism against\nWestern and Lebanese government interests in Lebanon.   \n A declaration from a retired Army major who was employed as Vice President of\nthe Applicant\u2019s company from April 2006 to May 2008, and is acquainted with the\nApplicant indicates that in his opinion, her relationship with her father would not call into\nquestion her identification or loyalty to the United States.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit A).  \nPOLICIES\nEnclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudication policies divided into\n\"Disqualifying Factors\" and \"Mitigating Factors.\"  The following Disqualifying Factors and\nMitigating Factors are found to be applicable in this case:\nForeign Influence\n6.  The Concern.  Foreign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the\nindividual has divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or\ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way that is not\nin U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by any foreign interest.\nAdjudication under this Guideline can and should consider the identity of the foreign\ncountry in which the foreign contact or financial interest is located, including, but not\nlimited to, such considerations as whether the foreign country is known to target United\nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a risk of\nterrorism. \nCondition that could raise a security concern:\n7.  (a) contact with a foreign family member, business or professional associate,\nfriend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident of a foreign country if that contact\ncreates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or\ncoercion; \n7.  (b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that create\na potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to protect sensitive\ninformation or technology and the individual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person, group, or\ncountry by providing that information.  \n\n6\nConditions that could mitigate security concerns:\n8.  (a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which\nthese persons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in that country\nare such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a position of having to choose\nbetween the interests of a foreign individual, group, organization, or government and the\ninterests of the U.S.;\n8.  (b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of\nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country is so minimal,\nor the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in the U.S.,\nthat the individual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S.;\n8.  (c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and infrequent\nthat there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign influence or exploitation;\n8.  (d) the foreign contacts and activities are on U.S. Government business or are\napproved by the cognizant security authority.\nGuideline E (Personal Conduct)\n15.  The Concern.  Conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty,\nor unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions about an\nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information.  OF\nspecial interest is any failure to provide truthful and candid answers during the security\nclearance process or any other failure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\nCondition that could raise a security concern:\n16.  (a) The deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant and\nmaterial facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or\nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award\nbenefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award\nfiduciary responsibilities.\nCondition that could mitigate security concerns:\nNone.\nIn addition, as set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive at pages 16-17,  in\nevaluating the relevance of an individual\u2019s conduct, the Administrative Judge should\nconsider the following general factors:\n a.  The nature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding circumstances\nb.  The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation\n\n7\nc.  The frequency and recency of the conduct\nd.  The individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct\ne.  The voluntariness of participation\nf.  The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavior\nchanges\ng.  The motivation for the conduct \nh. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress\n \ni.  The likelihood of continuation or recurrence.7\nThe eligibility criteria established in the DoD Directive identify personal\ncharacteristics and conduct which are reasonably related to the ultimate question, posed\nin Section 2 of Executive Order 10865, of whether it is \u201cclearly consistent with the\nnational interest\u201d to grant an Applicant\u2019s request for access to classified information.\nThe DoD Directive states, \u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a\nsufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the person is\nan acceptable security risk.  Eligibility for access to classified information is predicted\nupon the individual meeting these personnel security guidelines.  The adjudicative\nprocess is the careful weighing of a number of variables known as the whole person\nconcept.  Available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable\nand unfavorable should be considered in reaching a determination.\u201d The Administrative\nJudge can draw only those inferences or conclusions that have reasonable and logical\nbasis in the evidence of record.  The Judge cannot draw inferences or conclusions\nbased on evidence which is speculative or conjectural in nature.  Finally, as emphasized\nby President Eisenhower in Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under this order\n. . . shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a\ndetermination as to the loyalty of the Applicant concerned.\u201d\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn the defense industry, a security clearance is entrusted to civilian workers who\nmust be counted upon to safeguard such sensitive information twenty-four hours per\nday, seven days per week.  The Government is therefore appropriately concerned when\navailable information indicates that an Applicant for such access may be involved in\ninstances of financial irresponsibility and dishonesty which demonstrates poor judgment\nor unreliability.\nIt is the Government\u2019s responsibility to present substantial evidence to support\nthe finding of a nexus, or rational connection, between the Applicant\u2019s conduct and the\nholding of a security clearance.  If such a case has been established, the burden then\nshifts to the Applicant to go forward with evidence in rebuttal, explanation or mitigation\nwhich is sufficient to overcome or outweigh the Government\u2019s case.  The Applicant bears\n\n8\nthe ultimate burden of persuasion in proving that it is clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant her a security clearance.\nIn this case the Government has met its initial burden of proving that the\nApplicant has foreign contacts (Guideline B) and that she has been untruthful on her\nsecurity clearance application and certificate of foreign interests. (Guideline E).  This\nevidence indicates poor judgment, unreliability and untrustworthiness on the part of the\nApplicant.  Because of the scope and nature of the Applicant's conduct, I conclude there\nis a nexus or connection with his security clearance eligibility.\nConsidering all of the evidence, the Applicant has not introduced persuasive\nevidence in rebuttal, explanation or mitigation that is sufficient to overcome the\nGovernment's case.\n  \nThe Applicant has significant foreign contacts in Lebanon, that include her father,\nher father\u2019s cousins and other foreign business entities.  Disqualifying Conditions 7.(a)\ncontact with a foreign family member, business or professional associate, friend, or other\nperson who is a citizen of or resident of a foreign country if that contact creates a\nheightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion\nand 7.(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that create a\npotential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to protect sensitive\ninformation or technology and the individual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person, group, or\ncountry by providing that information apply. \nHowever, there are a number of mitigating conditions that also apply.  Mitigating\nConditions 8.(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which\nthese persons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in that country\nare such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a position of having to choose\nbetween the interests of a foreign individual, group, organization, or government and the\ninterests of the U.S. and 8.(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the\nindividual\u2019s sense of loyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or\ncountry is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships\nand loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any conflict of\ninterest in favor of the U.S.; 8.(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so\ncasual and infrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign\ninfluence or exploitation and 8.(d) the foreign contacts and activities are on U.S.\nGovernment business or are approved by the cognizant security authority also apply.\nApplicant is an American citizen with loyalties to the United States.  Her contact with her\nfather is now occasional and minimal, and her foreign contacts have been approved by\nthe Department of Defense for furtherance of Government business.  Accordingly, I find\nfor the Applicant under Guideline B (Foreign Influence). \nOn the other hand, with respect to Guideline E, the Applicant\u2019s failure to answer\nthe questions accurately on her Certificate Pertaining to Foreign Interest and on her\nSecurity Clearance Application is inexcusable.  Given the nature of her business, none of\nher explanations for failing to answer the questions accurately are reasonable or even\ncomprehensible.  Applicant is the owner of a company that subcontracts with foreign\ncompanies and individuals, and is responsible for ensuring that the interests of national\nsecurity are protected.  She had an independent responsibility to report those foreign\n\n9\nsubcontractors or individuals to the Government on the respective forms.  If the Applicant\nis unable to answer these questions accurately, she certainly cannot be trusted with the\nnational secrets.  The questions on the forms are neither difficult, confusing or\nmisleading.  Her signature on the respective forms certifies its completeness and\naccuracy.  \nNone of the Applicant\u2019s arguments have merit.  She did have foreign\nsubcontractors working with her company at the time she completed the forms.  (See\nGovernment  Exhibit 5 and Tr. pp. 77-79).  She knew or should have known to answer\nthe questions correctly and should have revealed all of her foreign contacts, in detail,\nand with no exceptions, on her on her Certificate Pertaining to her Financial Interest and\non her Security Clearance Application.  For whatever reason, she actively sought to\nconceal this information.  It is the Applicant\u2019s burden to justify, explain or mitigate her\nanswers, and she has not done so.  Consequently, the evidence shows that the\nApplicant cannot be trusted with the national secrets.  Disqualifying Condition 16(a)  the\ndeliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant and material facts from any\npersonnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to\nconduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status,\ndetermine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary\nresponsibilities applies.  None of the mitigating conditions are applicable.  I find that the\nApplicant deliberately sought to conceal material information from the Government and\nthat she is not qualified for access to classified information.  \nI have also considered the \u201cwhole person concept\u201d in evaluating the Applicant\u2019s\neligibility for access to classified information.  The Applicant is 42 years old, mature,\neducated, intelligent, successful, and is the owner of a defense contracting company.\nHowever, under the particular facts of this case, the totality of the conduct set forth under\nall of the guidelines viewed as a whole, support a whole person assessment of poor\njudgement, untrustworthiness, unreliability, a lack of candor, an unwillingness to comply\nwith rules and regulations, and/or other characteristics indicating that the person may not\nproperly safeguard classified information.  \nThis Applicant has not demonstrated that she is trustworthy, and does meet the\neligibility requirements for access to classified information.  Accordingly, I find against the\nApplicant under Guideline E (Personal Conduct).  Guideline B (Foreign Influence) is\nfound for the Applicant.     \nOn balance, it is concluded that the Applicant has failed to overcome the\nGovernment's case opposing her request for a security clearance.  Accordingly, the\nevidence supports a finding against the Applicant as to the factual and conclusionary\nallegations expressed in Paragraph 2 of the Government's Statement of Reasons.\nParagraph 1 is found for the Applicant.  \n\n10\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal findings For or Against the Applicant on the allegations in the SOR, as\nrequired by Paragraph 25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive are:\nParagraph 1: For the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.a.:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.b.:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.c.:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.d.:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.e.:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.f.:\nFor the Applicant.\n Paragraph 2: Against the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  2.a.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  2.b.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\nDECISION\nIn light of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly\nconsistent with the national interests to grant or continue a security clearance for the\nApplicant.\n        Darlene Lokey Anderson\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Nagel, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\nMarch 17, 2008\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nMOGUL, Martin H., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted his Security Clearance Application (SF 86), on May 5, 2006.\nOn September 25, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under Guidelines G and J\nfor Applicant. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative\nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective\nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant replied to the SOR (RSOR) in writing on October 28, 2007, and\nrequested a hearing before an Administrative Judge. The case was assigned to this\nAdministrative Judge on January 29, 2008. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on\nFebruary 7, 2008, and I convened the hearing as scheduled on March 4, 2008, in San\nDiego, California. The Government offered Exhibits (Ex.) 1 through 5, which were\nreceived without objection. Applicant testified on his own behalf. He submitted no\nexhibits. I granted Applicant\u2019s request to keep the record open until March 11, 2008, to\nsubmit an additional document.  On March 11, 2008, he submitted three sets of\n\n2\ndocuments, which have been marked as Exhibits A through C, and entered into\nevidence without objection, and the record closed on that date. DOHA received the\ntranscript of the hearing (Tr) on March 12, 2008. Based upon a review of the case file,\npleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified information is\ngranted. \nFindings of Fact\nIn his RSOR, Applicant admitted the SOR allegations 1.a., through 1.c., under\nGuideline G, and 2.a., under Guideline J. The admitted allegations are incorporated\nherein as findings of fact. \nAfter a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, including\nApplicant's RSOR, the admitted documents, and the testimony of Applicant, and upon\ndue consideration of that evidence, I make the additional findings of fact: \nApplicant is 29 years old. He is unmarried and has no children. He is employed\nby a defense contractor, and he seeks a DoD security clearance in connection with his\nemployment in the defense sector.\nParagraph 1 (Guideline G - Alcohol Consumption) \nThe Government alleges that Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he has\nengaged in excessive alcohol consumption. The following are the allegations as they\nare cited in the SOR, and to which, as stated above, Applicant admitted:\n1.a. On April 12, 2002, Applicant was charged with possession of an Open\nContainer in a Restricted Area. He received a citation and he mailed in a check in the\namount of $50. Applicant testified that he was with a group of friends on a beach,\ndrinking alcoholic beverages, which they did not realize was not allowed on that part of\nthe beach. He was 23 years old, so he could consume alcohol legally, but not at that\nparticular place. \n1.b. On October 31, 2003, Applicant was arrested and charged with (1) Driving\nUnder the Influence of Alcohol (DUI), (2) Driving While Having an 0.08% or Higher\nBlood Alcohol Content, and (3) Failure to Appear after signing a citation for court\nappearance.  He plead No Contest to Count (2), and the imposition of his sentence was\nsuspended for five years with summary probation granted. Applicant was ordered to\ncomplete the First Conviction Program, pay a fine of $1,706, and attend a MADD panel.\nCounts (1) and (3) were dismissed. He also attended three Alcoholics Anonymous\nmeetings, because of court orders. His probation continues until 2012. \nApplicant testified that he did not initially appear at the date specified, because\nthe attorney, whom he engaged to represent him, had not filed the papers in a timely\nmanner and did not inform him of the proper date to appear. \n\n3\nApplicant testified that he consumes alcohol in moderation, no more than two\ndays a week, and never to the point of intoxication. He also testified credibly that since\nthe DUI, he has not driven and will never drive again after consuming alcohol.  \nParagraph 2 (Guideline J - Criminal Conduct) \nThe Government alleges that Applicant has engaged in criminal acts.\n2.a.  The SOR alleges that Applicant\u2019s conduct that is set forth under paragraph\n1.a. and 1.b., above, constitutes criminal actions. \nMitigation\nApplicant submitted six character letters from individuals, who have known him in\neither professional or personal status or both (Exhibit A). They all were quite laudatory,\ndescribing Applicant \u201cas a person who can be relied on to make he right decisions,\u201d\n\u201dtrustworthy and honest,\u201d and \u201cdependable, reliable, hardworking, and honest.\u201d\nHe also submitted his two most recent Performance Reviews (Exhibit B). On both\nof them he was rated as \u201cHigh Meets,\u201d which is the second from the highest rating, and\nhe was described as \u201ca great asset\u201d to his employer. \nFinally, Exhibit C is a Notice of Completion Certificate that establishes that\nApplicant completed the First Offender Program. \nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\n\n4\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information)\nAnalysis\nGuideline G - Alcohol Consumption\nApplicant's alcohol consumption has resulted in one open container\ncitation in 2002, and one DUI arrest and conviction, occurring in 2006.\nThe Government established that Applicant was involved in an\nalcohol-related incident away from work, and binge alcohol consumption to the point of\nimpaired judgement on one occasion. Disqualifying Conditions (DC) 22. (a) and (c)\napply to this case.  \nAs stated above, Applicant admitted to currently drinking two time a week,\nbut in moderation, and he never drives after drinking.  I find that Mitigating Condition\n(MC) 23. (a) applies as the behavior was so infrequent, only one DUI in his life, for\nwhich he is extremely sorry, that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the\nindividual\u2019s current reliability and trustworthiness. Paragraph 1 is found for Applicant.\nGuideline J - Criminal Conduct\nThe Government has established that Applicant engaged in criminal conduct, as\nhe was arrested for, and convicted of a DUI criminal offense.\nIn reviewing the Disqualifying Conditions under Guideline J, DC 31. (a), a\nsingle serious crime or multiple lesser offenses, applies in this case. Under Mitigation\nConditions, I find that MC 32. (d) applies to this Applicant, as there is evidence of\n\n5\nsuccessful rehabilitation; including but not limited to the sincere remorse of Applicant,\nand his good employment record.  Applicant has mitigated this allegation. Paragraph 2\nis found for Applicant. \nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate\nan Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the\nApplicant\u2019s conduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should\nconsider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature,\nextent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct,\nto include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct;\n(4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which\nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for\npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or\nrecurrence.\u201d Under AG \u00b6 2 (c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility\nfor a security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.      \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Based on all of the factors\ndiscussed above, including the character letters and employment reviews, plus\nApplicant\u2019s credible sincere remorse, I find that Applicant is a decent person, who will\ncontinue to control his alcohol consumption, so that in the future, he will not find himself\nin the position of driving after he has consumed alcohol. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline G\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a.:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b.:\nFor  Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline J:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a.:\nFor Applicant\n\n6\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.

LYNCH\nAPPEARANCES\nFOR GOVERNMENT\nJulie R. Edmunds, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nSYNOPSIS\nApplicant incurred approximately $13,000 in delinquent debt, including many charged off\ncollection accounts. She provided no information concerning a plan to pay her creditors, and thus\nfailed to mitigate the security concerns raised under the financial considerations guideline.\nApplicant's eligibility for a security clearance is denied.\n\nThis action was taken under Executive Order 10865, dated February 20, 1960, as amended, and DoD Directive\n1\n5220.6, dated January 2, 1992, as amended and modified (Directive).\nThe government submitted five items in support of its contentions.\n2\nItem 3 (Applicant\u2019s Answer to SOR, dated March 19, 2007) at 1-3.\n3\nItem 4 (Application for Security Clearance (SF 86), dated December 4, 2004) at 1-15.\n4\nId.\n5\n2\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn March 1, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued Applicant\na Statement of Reasons (SOR) stating that it was unable to find that it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant or continue a security clearance.  The SOR, which is in essence the\n1\nadministrative complaint, alleged security concerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations)\nof the revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) issued on December 29, 2005, and implemented by the\nDepartment of Defense effective September 1, 2006. The revised guidelines were provided to\nApplicant when the SOR was issued.\nOn March 19, 2007, Applicant submitted a notarized response to the SOR, and elected to\nhave her case decided on the record in lieu of a hearing. Department Counsel submitted the\nGovernment\u2019s written case on April 16, 2007. Applicant received a complete file of relevant material\n(FORM) on April 23, 2007, and was provided the opportunity to file objections and submit material\nto refute, extenuate, or mitigate the Government\u2019s case.   Applicant did not submit any additional\n2\ninformation. The case was assigned to me on June 28, 2007. \nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant admitted  allegations in subparagraphs  1.b through 1. h in her SOR response under\nGuideline F. She denied allegation 1.a. with no explanation.  The admissions are incorporated as\n3\nfindings of fact. After a complete review of the evidence in the record and upon due consideration,\nI make the following additional findings of fact:\nApplicant is a 44-year-old employee of a defense contractor. After she graduated from high\nschool, she attended college. In 1992 she received her associate of arts degree. She has worked for\nher current employer since 1993.

She denied one debt in the SOR\nin the amount of $132.   However, the debt is still on her recent credit report.  Multiple accounts\n6\nwere charged off or placed for collection. Several of the debts have been in collection since 2003.7\nApplicant provided no details or information concerning the debts, her inability to pay, or her\nintention to pay them.\nPOLICIES\nThe President has \u201cthe authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national\nsecurity and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position \u2026 that\nwill give that person access to such information.\u201d   In Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\n8\nClassified Information Within Industry (Feb. 20, 1960), the President set out guidelines and\nprocedures for safeguarding classified information and determining trustworthiness within the\nexecutive branch. \nTo be eligible for a security clearance or access to sensitive information, an applicant must\nmeet the security guidelines contained in the Directive.  The revised Adjudicative Guidelines set forth\npotentially disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) under each guideline.\nAdditionally, each security decision must be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based on the\nrelevant and material facts and circumstances, the whole-person concept, along with the adjudicative\nprocess factors listed in \u00b6 6.3 of the Directive, and AG \u00b6 2(a).\n\u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make\nan affirmative determination that the person is eligible for a security clearance.\u201d    An administrative\n9\njudge must apply the \u201cwhole person concept,\u201d and consider and carefully weigh the available, reliable\ninformation about the person.   An administrative judge should consider the following factors: (1)\n10\nthe nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to\ninclude knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the\npresence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for\nthe conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of\ncontinuation or recurrence.   \n11\n\n Directive, \u00b6 E3.1.14.\n12\n Directive, \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n13\n ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. December 19, 2002).\n14\n Directive, \u00b6 E2.2.2.\n15\nAG \u00b6 18.\n16\n4\nInitially, the Government must present evidence to establish controverted facts in the SOR that\ndisqualify or may disqualify the applicant from being eligible for access to classified information.12\nThereafter, the applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or\nmitigate the facts.  An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent\n13\nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d  Any doubt as to whether\n14\naccess to classified information is clearly consistent with national security will be resolved in favor\nof the national security.  The same rules apply to trustworthiness determinations for access to\n15\nsensitive positions.\nCONCLUSIONS\nI have carefully considered all the facts in evidence and the legal standards. The government\nhas established a prima facie case for disqualification under Guideline F of the revised Adjudicative\nGuidelines (AG) most pertinent to the evaluation of the facts in this case.\n \nGuideline F (Financial Considerations) The Concern: Failure or inability to live within one\u2019s\nmeans, satisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment,\nor unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an\nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. An individual who\nis financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.16\nIn this matter, the government provided substantial evidence that Applicant accrued  delinquent\ndebts with an approximate total balance of $13,000. She admits they are still outstanding debts except\nfor one. Her 2007 credit report confirms all her alleged debts. Consequently, Financial Considerations\nDisqualifying Conditions (FC DC) AG \u00b619(a) (inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts) and FC DC\nAG \u00b619 (c) (a history of not meeting financial obligations) apply. \nWith the government\u2019s case established, the burden shifts to Applicant to present evidence of\nrefutation, extenuation, or mitigation to overcome the case against her. I considered the Financial\nConsiderations Mitigating Condition (FC MC) AG \u00b620 (a), (the behavior happened so long ago, was\nso infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt\non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment). It does not apply because\nApplicant still carries a significant amount of delinquent debt. One collection account is from 2000.\nDespite steady employment, these numerous debts are delinquent. She provided no explanation of\nspecial circumstances.\n\n5\nShe has been in her current position since 1993. She has not provided evidence or explanation\nto support the FC MC AG \u00b620 (b) (the conditions that resulted in the behavior were largely beyond\nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency,\nor a death, divorce, or separation) and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances).\nI have considered the remaining mitigating conditions and find that none of them apply. FC\nMC AG\u00b620(c) (the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem/and or there are\nclear indications that the problem is being resolved or under control); FC MC AG \u00b6 20 (d) (the\nindividual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts);FC MC\nAG \u00b620(e) (the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-due debt which\nis the cause of the problem and provides documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or\nprovides evidence of actions to resolve the issue) \nApplicant has not received financial counseling or developed a structured plan to resolve these\ndebts. Applicant's financial problems remain. It is unlikely they will be resolved in the near future.\nApplicant has not shown that she established a record of steady payments or financial stability.  Thus,\nI conclude that she has not made a good-faith effort to resolve her debts. This is confirmed debt on her\n2007 credit report.\nThe issue is not whether Applicant is still legally liable for any or all of her outstanding debts,\nbut whether she has presented sufficient evidence of extenuation, mitigation or changed circumstances\nto warrant a favorable security determination. Her remaining unpaid debt constitutes a security\nconcern.  She has been employed with her current employer since 1993. She has  she has chosen not\nto resolve her delinquent debts. Applicant has not mitigated the government\u2019s concerns under\nGuideline F.\nWhole Person\nIn all adjudications, the protection of our national security is the paramount concern. The\nobjective of the trustworthy determination process is the fair-minded, commonsense assessment of a\nperson\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the person is eligible for assignment to sensitive\nduties. Indeed, the adjudicative process is a careful weighing of a number of variables in considering\nthe \u201cwhole person\u201d concept. It recognizes that we should view a person by the totality of their acts,\nomissions, motivations and other variables. Each case must be adjudged on its own merits, taking into\nconsideration all relevant circumstances, and applying sound judgment, mature thinking, and careful\nanalysis.\nI have considered all the evidence and the \u201cwhole person\u201d in evaluating Applicant\u2019s security\nclearance determination.  Even an applicant with a good or even exemplary work history may engage\nin conduct that has negative implications or presents doubt about her judgment. Despite steady\nemployment, Applicant has accrued multiple delinquent accounts. It is not clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant Applicant a security clearance. Clearance is denied.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\n\n6\nFormal Findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required\nby Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1. Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h:\nAgainst Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly\nconsistent with national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.

    "summary": "FINDINGS OF FACT Under Guideline F, the SOR alleges seven delinquent debts ranging from $18 to $9,004 for a total of about $30,000 (excluding the account in \u00b6 1.g). Under Guideline E, the SOR alleges Applicant gave deliberately false answers to three questions about his financial history when completing a security-clearance application in March 2006. In his reply to the SOR, he admits the delinquent indebtedness except for \u00b6\u00b6 1.d and 1.f. Also, he admits giving false answers on his security-clearance application. In addition, the following facts are established. Applicant is a 48-year-old tool maker. He has worked for his current employer since November 1978. He has been married to the same spouse since 1978. He is seeking to retain a security clearance previously granted to him by the Defense Department. Applicant has a history of financial problems as evidenced by delinquent debts. His adverse financial history is established by three credit reports, his response to financial interrogatories, a record of judgment, and his admissions (Exhibits 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8).

Applicant contests the Defense Department\u2019s intent to deny\nor revoke his eligibility for a security clearance. Acting under the relevant Executive Order and DoD\nDirective,  the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a statement of reasons\n1\n(SOR) to Applicant on August 13, 2007. The SOR is equivalent to an administrative complaint and\nit details the factual basis for the action. In general, the issues in this case fall under Guideline F for\nfinancial considerations based on delinquent debts and Guideline E for personal conduct based on\nfalsification of a security-clearance application.  \nIn addition to the Directive, this case is brought under the revised Adjudicative Guidelines\nfor Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information (Revised Guidelines) approved by\nthe President on December 29, 2005. The Revised Guidelines were then modified by the Defense\nDepartment, effective September 1, 2006. They supersede or replace the guidelines published in\nEnclosure 2 to the Directive. They apply to all adjudications and other determinations where an SOR\nhas been issued on September 1, 2006, or thereafter.  The Directive is pending revision or\n2\namendment. The Revised Guidelines apply here because the SOR is dated after the effective date.\nApplicant replied to the SOR in writing on August 31, 2007. He elected to have his case\ndecided on the written record in lieu of a hearing.\nOn September 26, 2007, the government submitted its written case consisting of all relevant\nand material information that could be adduced at a hearing. This so-called file of relevant material\n(FORM) was mailed to Applicant and it was received by him on October 9, 2007. Applicant did not\nsubmit any information within the 30-day period after receiving the FORM. The case was assigned\nto me on December 13, 2007.   \nRULINGS ON PROCEDURE\nIn its FORM, the government conceded that the account alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.g duplicates the\naccount alleged in \u00b6 1.f. Accordingly, the government withdrew the allegation in  \u00b6 1.g and no\nfinding will be made. \nAlso in its FORM, the government included as an item of documentary evidence a subject\ninterview of Applicant. The interview was part of a report of investigation (ROI) prepared by the\nU.S. Office of Personnel Management (Exhibit 9). The ROI indicates that the Applicant\u2019s subject\ninterview was an unsworn declaration made in October 2006. The general rule is that a background\nROI may not be received and considered by an administrative judge.  The exception to the general\n3\nrule is \u201c[a]n ROI may be received with an authenticating witness provided it is otherwise admissible\n\n Id. \n4\n3\nunder the Federal Rules of Evidence.\u201d  Here, in offering the ROI as part of its FORM, the\n4\ngovernment did not mention the general rule against an ROI, nor did it make any argument to justify\nadmitting the ROI. Likewise, the ROI is not accompanied by an authenticating witness or some other\nmethod of getting evidence to the trier of fact, such as a stipulation between the parties. Accordingly,\nthe ROI has not been considered. \nFINDINGS OF FACT\nUnder Guideline F, the SOR alleges seven delinquent debts ranging from $18 to $9,004 for\na total of about $30,000 (excluding the account in \u00b6 1.g). Under Guideline E, the SOR alleges\nApplicant gave deliberately false answers to three questions about his financial history when\ncompleting a security-clearance application in March 2006. In his reply to the SOR, he admits the\ndelinquent indebtedness except for \u00b6\u00b6 1.d and 1.f. Also, he admits giving false answers on his\nsecurity-clearance application. In addition, the following facts are established. \nApplicant is a 48-year-old tool maker. He has worked for his current employer since\nNovember 1978. He has been married to the same spouse since 1978. He is seeking to retain a\nsecurity clearance previously granted to him by the Defense Department.  \nApplicant has a history of financial problems as evidenced by delinquent debts. His adverse\nfinancial history is established by three credit reports, his response to financial interrogatories, a\nrecord of judgment, and his admissions (Exhibits 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8). The status of his indebtedness\nalleged in the SOR is summarized in the following table.\nDebt Description\nCurrent Status\nSOR \u00b6 1.a\u2013collection account for $4,864.\nNo proof of payment.    \nSOR \u00b6 1.b\u2013charged-off account for $1,533.\nNo proof of payment.    \nSOR \u00b6 1.c\u2013judgment for $8,000.   \nNo proof of payment.        \nSOR \u00b6 1.d\u2013collection account for $18. \nNo proof of payment.    \nSOR \u00b6 1.e\u2013charged-off account for $3,146. \nNo proof of payment.      \nSOR \u00b6 1.f\u2013collection account for $9,004.\nNo proof of payment.     \nSOR \u00b6 1.h\u2013collection account for $3,506. \nNo proof of payment.     \nAlthough he denied the indebtedness alleged in \u00b6\u00b6 1.d and 1.f, the evidence establishes those\naccounts. The delinquent account in \u00b6 1.d is established by the three credit reports. The delinquent\naccount in \u00b6 1.f is established by two of the credit reports. Also, Applicant admitted this debt in\nresponse to the financial interrogatories. \n\n Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988) (\u201cit should be obvious that no one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a\n5\nsecurity clearance\u201d); Duane v. Department of Defense, 275 F.3d 988, 994 (10  Cir. 2002) (\u201cIt is likewise plain that there\nth\nis no \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance, so that full-scale due process standards do not apply to cases such as Duane\u2019s.\u201d).\n Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.\n6\n Directive, \u00b6 3.2. \n7\n Directive, \u00b6 3.2. \n8\n ISCR Case No. 02-18663 (App. Bd. Mar. 23, 2004).\n9\n4\nIn his reply to the SOR, Applicant provided, in part, the following explanation:\n\u2022\nHe has held a security clearance for about 20 years, has never had a security violation, and\ntakes the matter of a security clearance seriously.\n\u2022\nHe has paid off one account not listed in the SOR, is making payments on another account,\nand is taking the approach of paying off one account at a time.\n\u2022\nHe will be able to make more payments when his home is paid off in six years. He was\nunable to repay the debt by refinancing his home due to poor credit.\n\u2022\nHe elected not to pursue bankruptcy because his plan is to repay the debts.\n\u2022\nHe is the main bread winner for his family. \nIn about March 2006, Applicant signed a security-clearance application (Exhibit 3). In doing\nso, he certified that his answers were true, complete, and correct to the best of his knowledge and\nbelief and made in good faith. Also, he understood that a knowing and willful false statement on the\napplication could be punished by a fine or imprisonment or both. In response to Questions 27, 28a,\nand 28b, he answered in the negative. He did not disclose any of the adverse financial information\ncalled for by the questions. In his reply to the SOR, Applicant explained that when he completed the\nsecurity-clearance application he was embarrassed and concerned that his company would learn\nabout his financial problems. Also, he admitted that he was not honest when answering the financial\nquestions. \nGENERAL PRINCIPLES OF LAW AND POLICIES\nNo one has a right to a security clearance.  As noted by the Supreme Court in Department\n5\nof Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe clearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations\nshould err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d  A favorable decision establishes eligibility of an\n6\napplicant to be granted a security clearance for access to confidential, secret, or top-secret\ninformation.  An unfavorable decision: (1) denies any application; (2)  revokes any existing security\n7\nclearance; and (3) prevents access to classified information at any level and retention of any existing\nsecurity clearance.  Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive, any doubt about whether\n8\nan applicant should be allowed access to classified information will be resolved in favor of\nprotecting national security.\nThere is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for access\nto classified information.  The government has the burden of presenting evidence to establish facts\n9\n\n Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.14.\n10\n Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n11\n Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n12\n Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n13\n ISCR Case No. 01-20700 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002) (citations omitted).\n14\n Executive Order 10865, \u00a7 7.\n15\n Revised Guidelines at pp. 13\u201314 (setting forth the disqualifying and mitigating conditions). \n16\n Revised Guidelines at p. 13. \n17\n5\nalleged in the SOR that have been controverted.  An applicant is responsible for presenting evidence\n10\nto refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts that have been admitted or proven.  In addition, an\n11\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.  In Egan,\n12\nthe Supreme Court said that the burden of proof is less than the preponderance of the evidence.  The\n13\nagency appellate authority has followed the Court\u2019s reasoning, and a judge\u2019s findings of fact are\nreviewed under the substantial-evidence standard.14\nThe Revised Guidelines set forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when evaluating a\nperson\u2019s security clearance eligibility, including disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating\nconditions (MC) for each guideline. In addition, each clearance decision must be a fair and impartial\ncommonsense decision based upon consideration of all the relevant and material information, the\npertinent criteria and adjudication factors, and the whole-person concept. A person granted access\nto classified information enters into a special relationship with the government. The government\nmust be able to have a high degree of trust and confidence in those persons to whom it grants access\nto classified information. The decision to deny a person a security clearance is not a determination\nof an applicant\u2019s loyalty.  Instead, it is a determination that the applicant has not met the strict\n15\nguidelines the President has established for granting eligibility for a security clearance.\nCONCLUSIONS\nUnder Guideline F for financial considerations,  a security concern typically exists due to\n16\nsignificant unpaid debts. \u201cFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by\nrules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability,\ntrustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information.\u201d  Similarly, an individual who is\n17\nfinancially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, unconcerned, negligent, or careless in properly\nhandling and safeguarding classified information.   \nThe record evidence supports a conclusion that Applicant has a history of financial problems.\nHis history of financial problems is a security concern because it indicates inability or unwillingness\n\n DC 1 is \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts.\u201d \n18\n DC 3 is \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d \n19\n Revised Guidelines at pp. 10\u201312 (setting forth the disqualifying and mitigating conditions). \n20\n Revised Guidelines at p. 10. \n21\n DC 1 is \u201cdeliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any personnel security\n22\nquestionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment\nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary\nresponsibilities.\u201d\n6\nto satisfy debts  and a history of not meeting financial obligations  within the meaning of Guideline\n18\n19\nF. The record evidence is more than sufficient to establish these two disqualifying conditions as well\nas a pattern of financial irresponsibility. \nAll of the mitigating conditions under Guideline F have been considered and none apply in\nApplicant\u2019s favor. He did not present sufficient evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the\nfinancial considerations security concern. In particular, the record evidence is insufficient to establish\nthat he has made a good-faith effort to pay or otherwise resolve his indebtedness. Applicant has\nworked for the same company since 1978 and has incurred a large amount of consumer debt, which\nis delinquent. He does not have a realistic plan to repay or otherwise resolve his financial problems\nin the near future. He has presented little evidence to show that his financial problems are resolved\nor under control. Given his history of financial problems, it is too soon to make a predictive\njudgment about his ability to resolve his indebtedness and then live a financially-responsible\nlifestyle. Applicant\u2019s efforts, at this point, are insufficient to mitigate the financial considerations\nsecurity concern. Accordingly, Guideline F is decided against Applicant. \nPersonal conduct under Guideline E  addresses \u201cconduct involving questionable judgment,\n20\nlack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations.\u201d  In this regard,\n21\nthe deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of a material fact in any written document or\noral statement to the government when applying for a security clearance or in other official matters\nis a security concern. It is deliberate if it is done knowingly and willfully. An omission of relevant\nand material information is not deliberate if the person genuinely forgot about it, inadvertently\noverlooked it, misunderstood the question, or genuinely thought the information did not need to be\nreported.\nAt issue here is the truthfulness of Applicant\u2019s answers to three questions seeking\ninformation  about his financial history. He admits giving false answers to the questions due to\nembarrassment and fear of discovery by his employer. Neither excuse is sufficient to rebut, explain,\nextenuate, or mitigate his falsifications. Accordingly, the record evidence is sufficient to conclude\nthat DC 1  applies against Applicant. \n22\nAll of the mitigating conditions under Guideline E have been considered and none apply in\nApplicant\u2019s favor. Making false statements during the security-clearance process is serious\nmisconduct, and it is not easily explained away or mitigated. Accordingly, Guideline E is decided\nagainst Applicant.  \n\n7\nTo conclude, Applicant did not present sufficient evidence to explain, extenuate, or mitigate\nthe security concerns. Applicant did not meet his ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable\nclearance decision. In reaching this conclusion, the whole-person concept was given due\nconsideration and that analysis does not support a favorable decision. \nFORMAL FINDINGS\nSOR \u00b6 1\u2013Guideline F:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraphs a, b, c, d, e, f, h:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph g:\nWithdrawn \nSOR \u00b6 2\u2013Guideline E:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraphs a\u2013c:\nAgainst Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant\nor continue eligibility for a security clearance for Applicant.

MOGUL\nAPPEARANCES\nFOR GOVERNMENT\nJeff A. Nagel, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nSYNOPSIS\nApplicant is a 47 year-old naturalized United States citizen, who was born in Lebanon in\n1960 and moved to the U.S. in 1980. His wife, daughter, two brothers and one sister are all United\nStates citizens and residents.  Applicant\u2019s mother and parents-in-law are citizens and residents of\nLebanon. None of these family members belong to, participate in, or are active with any government\nagency of Lebanon.  They do not constitute an unacceptable security risk, because Applicant has\nsuch deep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in the U.S., that he can be expected to resolve\nany conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. Mitigation has been shown. Clearance is granted. \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\n\n2\nOn April 4, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to\nExecutive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2,\n1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant which detailed reasons why DOHA could\nnot make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant and recommended referral\nto an Administrative Judge to determine whether clearance should be denied or revoked.\nApplicant responded to the SOR in writing on May 29, 2007. Applicant requested a clearance\ndecision based on a hearing record.\nThe case was assigned to this Administrative Judge to conduct a hearing and issue a written\ndecision on July 23, 2007. A Notice of Hearing was issued to the parties on October 4, 2007, and the\nhearing was held on October 18, 2007, in San Jose, California..\nAt the hearing, Department Counsel offered two documentary exhibits (Exhibits 1and 2) and\nno witnesses were called. Applicant offered 27 documentary exhibits (Exhibits A - AA) and offered\nhis own testimony. The record was left open until October 26, 2007, to allow Applicant to offer\nadditional documentation regarding individual of Lebanese heritage.  Applicant offered additional\ndocumentation in a timely manner, which has been identified collectively as Exhibit BB. Department\nCounsel offered no objection. I have entered Exhibit BB for Applicant.  The transcript (Tr) was\nreceived on October 26, 2007. \nFINDINGS OF FACT\nIn the SOR, the Government alleges that a security risk may exist under Adjudicative\nGuideline B and Guideline C of the Directive. The SOR contains six allegations, 1.a. through 1.f.,\nunder Guideline B, and two allegations, 2.a. and 2.b., under Guideline C. Applicant admitted SOR\nallegations 1.a., 1.b., 1.d., 1.e., and 1,f., and he denied 1.c., 2.a., and 2.b. The admissions are\nincorporated herein as findings of fact. \nAfter a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, including Applicant's\nAnswer to the SOR, the documents and the live testimony, and upon due consideration of that\nevidence, I make the additional findings of fact: \nApplicant is 47 years old, married and has one 2 \u00bd  year old daughter. He received a Bachelor\nof Science degree in Physics in 1981, a second Bachelor of Science degree in Electrical Engineering\nin 1982, and a Master\u2019s Degree in Electrical Engineering in 1986, all from United States universities.\nApplicant is employed as an Electrical Engineer by a defense contractor, and he seeks a security\nclearance for that position.  \nApplicant  was born in Lebanon in 1960, and he moved to the United States in 1980 at the\nage of 20. He became a United States citizen in 1996.\nApplicant\u2019s wife is a Lebanese born United States citizen. Their daughter is a natural born\nUnited States citizen.\n\n3\nApplicant has two brothers and one sister, who were all born in Lebanon, but are now United\nStates residents and citizens. \nParagraph 1 (Guideline B - Foreign Influence) \n1.a. Applicant's mother is a  citizen and resident of Lebanon.  She is 73 and a homemaker.\nApplicant has weekly contact with her by telephone. His mother has visited the U.S. many times, but\nshe has no plan to move here permanently. She has never worked for the government of Lebanon,\nnor does she receive a pension form the Lebanese government. \n1.b. Applicant's father-in-law and mother-in-law are citizens and residents of Lebanon.  His\nfather-in-law is 76 years old, and he is a retired meteorologist for the airport authority in Lebanon.\nApplicant\u2019s mother-in-law is 60, and she never worked outside the home. \n1.c. The SOR alleges that Applicant's sister resides in Qatar.  At the hearing, Applicant\ntestified that his sister did live in Qatar for approximately one year, while she was employed by a\nsubsidiary of a U.S. Company. She no longer works for that company. His sister now resides in the\nUnited States, and she is a United States citizen. She has no plans to reside in Qatar in the future. \n1.d. Applicant's brother-in-law is a citizen of Lebanon. While it was alleged in the SOR that\nhe was also a resident of Lebanon, Applicant testified that his brother-in-law works as a quality\nassurance representative for a private company in Saudi Arabia, where he lives.\n1.e. Applicant has another brother-in-law, who is a citizen of Lebanon. He lives in Kuwait,\nwhere he works for a Kuwaiti bank.\n1.f. Applicant traveled to Lebanon in the years 2005, 2002, 2001, 1999, and 1998. All of\nthese trips were to visit his parents, or on one occasion when he attended his father\u2019s funeral. \nParagraph 2 (Guideline C - Foreign Preference) \n2.a. It is alleged in the SOR that Applicant exercised dual citizenship with Lebanon and the\nUnited States. Applicant contends that he has not engaged in any of the responsibilities or duties of\nbeing a Lebanese citizen, such as voting in elections of Lebanon, or paying taxes to the government\nof Lebanon. The only potential exercise of Lebanese citizenship is the use of his Lebanese passport,\nafter he became a United States citizen, which is alleged in the SOR as 2.b., and which will be\nreviewed below. \n2.b. It is also alleged in the SOR that Applicant used his Lebanese passport, which was valid\nfrom June 1995 through December 2005, to enter or exit Lebanon, after he became a United States\ncitizen on October 25, 1996, and received a United States passport in December 1997. Applicant\ntestified that when he entered Lebanon, he would identify himself as a United States citizen and\nshow his U.S. passport. Either because of his name or his accent, he was asked if he was of Lebanese\ndescent. He confirmed that he was, and he was then asked if he had a Lebanese identification. He\nthen showed his Lebanese passport which was used to help him enter Lebanon. When he exited\nLebanon to return to the U.S., he used his United States passport.  \n\n4\nApplicant testified that his Lebanese passport has expired, and he has no intention of\nrenewing it. I can not find that his use of his Lebanese passport, in the way described above,\nindicated a preference for another county over the United Sates or exhibited the exercise of dual\ncitizenship with Lebanon and the U.S.\nFinally, while Applicant testified that he does not consider himself a citizen of Lebanon since\nhe has become a U.S. citizen, he is willing to renounce his Lebanese citizenship if requested to do\nso. \nWhen he was questioned as to what he would do if a representative of a terrorist group in\nLebanon threatened his mother if he did not cooperate with them, he testified, \u201c. . . I would make the\ndecision not to cooperate. And then I will of course follow all the rules of the U.S., to go to the FBI\nand all the agencies to let them know what\u2019s going on.\u201d (Tr at 90). \n  \nCurrent Status of Lebanon\nSince Applicant's mother and other relatives are citizens and residents of Lebanon, it is\nimportant to consider the status of Lebanon.\nLebanon is a \u201cparliamentary republic\u201d which has been in a state of war with Israel since\n1973. Lebanon\u2019s foreign policy has been heavily influence by neighboring Syria, which has also\nlong influenced Lebanon\u2019s internal policies as well. Syrian troop strength in Lebanon went from a\nhigh of 35,000 to 40,000 in the 1980s to complete withdrawal in 2005. However, Syria\u2019s intelligent\nassets remain, and it continues to have a strong influence in Lebanese politics.  \nSyria provides political and material support to Hizballah, the most prominent terrorist group\nin Lebanon. Not only does the Lebanese government still recognize Hizballah as a legitimate\nresistance group, and political group, but Hizballah maintains offices in Lebanon and has official\nliaison officers to Lebanon\u2019s security services. Finally, there have been findings of Lebanese security\nforces arbitrarily arresting and detaining individuals and instances of arbitrary or unlawful\ndeprivation of life torture, and other abuses. \nMitigation\nApplicant submitted a number of documents in support of his request to obtain a security\nclearance. Among these were positive letters from his brother, who is a Medical Doctor, his sister,\nand five additional individuals. These letters all discussed Applicant in extremely positive terms as\na hard working, conscientious, loyal, and trustworthy individual. Applicant also offered\ndocumentation that exhibits his volunteer activities in such organizations as Special Olympics,\nVolunteer Fire Department, and his many worthy efforts to help students, primarily in the\nengineering field.  \nPOLICIES\n\n5\n           Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to be considered in evaluating\nan individual's security eligibility. The Administrative Judge must take into account the conditions\nraising or mitigating security concerns in each area applicable to the facts and circumstances\npresented. Each adjudicative decision must also assess the factors listed in Section F.3. and in\nEnclosure (2) of the Directive. Although the presence or absence of a particular condition for or\nagainst clearance is not determinative, the specific adjudicative guidelines should be followed\nwhenever a case can be measured against this policy guidance, as the guidelines reflect consideration\nof those factors of seriousness, recency, motivation, etc. \nBURDEN OF PROOF\nInitially, the Government must prove controverted facts alleged in the Statement of Reasons.\nIf the Government meets that burden, the burden of persuasion then shifts to the applicant to\nestablish his security suitability through evidence of refutation, extenuation or mitigation sufficient\nto demonstrate that, despite the existence of disqualifying conduct, it is nevertheless clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue the security clearance. Assessment of an\napplicant's fitness for access to classified information requires evaluation of the whole person, and\nconsideration of such factors as the recency and frequency of the disqualifying conduct, the\nlikelihood of recurrence, and evidence of rehabilitation.\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with\nthe U.S. Government that is predicated upon trust and confidence. Where facts proven by the\nGovernment raise doubts about an applicant's judgment, reliability, or trustworthiness, the applicant\nhas a heavy burden of persuasion to demonstrate that he or she is nonetheless security worthy. As\nnoted by the United States Supreme Court in Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531\n(1988), \"the clearly consistent standard indicates that security-clearance determinations should err,\nif they must, on the side of denials.\"\nCONCLUSIONS\nHaving considered the evidence of record in light of the appropriate legal precepts and\nfactors, and having assessed the credibility of those who testified, I conclude the following with\nrespect to Guidelines B and C:\n(Guideline B - Foreign Influence) \nBased on the evidence of record, the Government has established an initial reason to deny\nApplicant a security clearance because of Guideline B (Foreign Influence). Applicant\u2019s mother and\nother relatives are citizens of Lebanon, a country with some interests inimical to the United States\nand therefore, which must be scrutinized in great detail. Relatives in Lebanon could create the\npotential for foreign influence that could result in the compromise of classified information because\nit makes Applicant potentially vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or pressure. The possession of\nsuch ties raises a security concern sufficient to require Applicant to present evidence in rebuttal, \nextenuation, or mitigation sufficient to meet her burden of persuasion that it is clearly consistent with\nthe national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for him. This Applicant has done.\n\n6\n  In reviewing the Disqualifying Conditions (DC) I find that DC 7. (a) applies, contact with\nforeign family members, who are citizens and residents in a foreign country, if that contact creates\nheightened risk of foreign exploitation, pressure or coercion.   \nUnder Mitigating Conditions (MC) I have determined that MC 8. (b) applies as I find no\nconflict of interest because Applicant has such deep and longstanding relationships and loyalties, that\nany conflicts can be expected to be resolved in favor of the U.S. The  primary factors that I have\nconsidered in applying MC 8. (b) and in reviewing Applicant under the \u201cwhole person concept\u201d\ninclude: the fact that Applicant has lived in the U.S. since 1980, approximately 29 of his 49 years,\nand been a U.S. citizen since 1996;  he is married to U.S. naturalized citizen and they have a\ndaughter who is solely a U.S. citizen; he received all of his college training in the United States,\nincluding two Bachelor of Science degrees and one Master of Science degree, he has established a\nsuccessful career here; his two brothers and one sister are U.S. citizens and residents; the very\npositive documents he introduced on his own behalf;  and finally his self proclaimed strong  feelings\nof affection and devotion to the U.S.\n \n        \nAfter considering all of the evidence of record on Guideline B, I conclude that the mitigating\nevidence substantially outweighs the evidence supporting the SOR .   \n(Guideline C - Foreign Preference)\nGuideline C is based on actions taken by an individual that indicate a preference for a foreign\ncountry over the United States. Applicant\u2019s initial retention of his Lebanese  passport raises foreign\npreference (Guideline C) concerns. At the time the SOR was issued, DC 10. (a), the exercise of the\nprivilege of foreign citizenship could be argued to apply because (1) he retained his Lebanese\npassport. I conclude that MC 11. (b) and (e) apply to this case, since Applicant indicated a\nwillingness to renounce his Lebanese citizenship, even though he does not believe he is a Lebanese\ncitizen, and his foreign passport, which he only used incidentally after first showing his U.S.\npassport and identifying himself as a United States citizen, has expired and Applicant has no\nintention to renew it.\nAccordingly, I find Guideline C for Applicant and I hold that at this time it is clearly\nconsistent with national security to grant Applicant  a security clearance.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\n\n7\nParagraph 1.

MATCHINSKI\nAPPEARANCES\nFOR GOVERNMENT\nFahryn Hoffman, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nBryan J. Kerman, Esq.\nSYNOPSIS\nApplicant is a native of Nepal who became a U.S. citizen in October 1999. Foreign influence\nconcerns raised by the Nepali citizenship of her spouse and the Nepali residency and citizenship of\nher parents are mitigated by her strong ties to the United States where she has lived and resided for\nthe past 18 years. Clearance is granted.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a\nsecurity clearance for Applicant. As required by \u00b6 E3.1.2 of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6\n(Jan. 2, 1992), as amended, DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) on July 2, 2007, detailing\nthe basis for its decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline B (foreign influence) of the\nrevised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) issued on December 29, 2005, and implemented by the\n\n2\nDepartment of Defense effective September 1, 2006. The revised guidelines were provided to\nApplicant when the SOR was issued. Applicant, acting pro se, answered the SOR on July 12, 2007,\nand elected to have a hearing before an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on\nSeptember 19, 2007. Counsel for Applicant entered his appearance on October 1, 2007.\n \nI convened a hearing on November 7, 2007, to consider whether it is clearly consistent with\nthe national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. Two government exhibits\n(Ex. 1-2) were admitted and Applicant testified. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on\nNovember 16, 2007.\nRULINGS ON PROCEDURE\nOn September 12, 2007, the government requested administrative notice be taken of several\nproposed facts concerning Nepal. The government relied on publications from the U.S. State\nDepartment: Background Note: Nepal, dated May 2007, Country Reports on Human Rights\nPractices-2006, dated March 6, 2007, Consular Information Sheet: Nepal, dated June 27, 2007,\nTravel Warning: Nepal, dated May 7, 2007, and Country Reports on Terrorism, Chapter 2, dated\nApril 30, 2007. On October 5, 2007, I informed the parties that consistent with DOHA Appeal Board\nrulings stressing consideration of the most current political conditions in foreign countries (see ISCR\nCase No. 05-11292, Apr. 12, 2007), I intended to review for purposes of taking administrative notice\nan updated travel warning on Nepal issued by the State Department on September 24, 2007. No\nobjections were filed to the request for administrative notice or to my consideration of the updated\ntravel warning. After weighing the reliability of the source documentation, including the updated\ntravel warning, and assessing the relevancy and materiality of the facts proposed, I took\nadministrative notice of certain facts pertinent to Nepal as set forth below.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nDOHA alleged under Guideline B that Applicant\u2019s spouse is a Nepali citizen residing in the\nU.S. (SOR \u00b6 1.a), her parents are resident citizens of Nepal (SOR \u00b6 1.b), her father was employed\nin the U.S. from about 1998 to about 2001 after having worked in the Republic of India Embassy\nin Nepal prior to that (SOR \u00b6 1.c), and that Applicant traveled to Nepal in 1992, 1997, and 2005\n(SOR \u00b6 1.d). Applicant admitted the allegations, explaining that her spouse has been in the U.S. for\nalmost 33 years and that her spouse and his immediate family members do not intend to return to\nNepal permanently. Her parents, who had permanent residency in the U.S. from 1998 to 2003 and\nare retired, returned to Nepal as they had difficulty assimilating in the U.S. Applicant added that her\ntravel to Nepal was to visit her parents and extended family in Nepal when she was a student or\nemployed in the private sector. \nApplicant\u2019s admissions are incorporated as findings of fact. After a thorough review of the\npleadings, exhibits, and transcript, and having agreed to take administrative notice of certain facts,\nI make the following additional findings of fact.\n\n3\nApplicant is a 41-year-old senior software engineer who has been employed by a defense\ncontractor since August 2005. She held an interim secret-level security clearance without adverse\nincident.\nApplicant was born in Nepal in November 1966. She was raised in Nepal along with her\nbrother, who is three years younger. Their mother worked as a public high school science teacher\nuntil she retired. Their father was employed by the Indian Embassy as an auditor in its pension\ndepartment in Nepal until about 1986 when he quit after it was legally determined that Nepali\nemployees at the embassy were not entitled to pensions from the Indian government. Their father\nthen went to work in the private sector as a travel agent and then as a human resources representative\nat a casino before he retired. \nApplicant came to the U.S. in 1989 for her marriage to a Nepali citizen who had become a\nU.S. permanent resident in about February 1975.  Theirs was an arranged marriage in accord with\ntradition. He was employed as an automotive technician. Applicant and her spouse have two teenage\ndaughters who were born in the U.S. in January 1991 and May 1994. In 1992, Applicant took her\nfirst daughter to visit her parents in Nepal. They stayed two months. While in Nepal, Applicant also\nvisited with extended family members, including her parents\u2019 siblings.\nFrom May 1990 to May 1994, Applicant pursued her associate\u2019s degree at a community\ncollege. She continued on at a public university and earned her bachelor of science degree in May\n1998.\nIn 1997, Applicant\u2019s brother came to the U.S. for college. As of August 2005, her brother\nwas in the U.S. on an H1 (temporary employment) visa. His employer, a computer company, has\nsponsored him for permanent residency.\nApplicant traveled with both daughters to Nepal to see her parents in 1997. They stayed three\nmonths. She again visited with extended family members on that trip, including her father\u2019s half-\nbrother and his family. In July 1998, Applicant began working as a software engineer for a computer\nfirm in the U.S. She stayed on with the company through acquisitions until she was laid off in\nNovember 2004.\nApplicant became a naturalized U.S. citizen in mid-October 1999, taking an oath to renounce\nall foreign allegiances, to support and defend the U.S. Constitution and its laws, and to bear arms\nor perform noncombatant service or civilian service on behalf of the U.S. if required. She acquired\nU.S. citizenship because of the greater opportunities open to her than if she was a lawful permanent\nresident and because she wanted to sponsor her parents\u2019 immigration to the U.S. Applicant assumes\nshe is no longer a Nepali citizen since Nepal does not allow dual citizenship, but she has not taken\nany action to confirm it (\u201cI don\u2019t even care because I didn\u2019t bother to renew, I don\u2019t even know\nwhere my [Nepali] passport is.\u201d Tr. 64). On April 16, 2001, she was issued a U.S. passport. Her\nspouse has not applied for U.S. citizenship.\nUnder Applicant\u2019s sponsorship, Applicant\u2019s parents became lawful permanent residents in\nabout 1999. They came to the U.S. and alternated living with Applicant and with her brother for the\nnext two years. Applicant\u2019s mother did not work when she was in the U.S. Applicant\u2019s father was\nemployed part-time for a local discount retailer as he did not want to be solely dependent on\n\n4\nApplicant or her brother for support. They returned to Nepal for the less hectic lifestyle and because\nof the difficulties learning a new language, culture, and lifestyle.\nIn May 2002, Applicant started taking classes toward her master\u2019s degree in computer science\nwhile working for the computer company. In 2002, Applicant\u2019s parents returned to the U.S. to again\nattempt to assimilate but stayed only about a year. Applicant learned during their stay that her\nfather\u2019s half-brother was the chief district officer (mayor) for a municipality in Nepal. \nIn November 2004, Applicant was laid off from her position with the computer company.\nWhile undertaking a job search, she took advantage of her unemployed status by traveling to Nepal\non her U.S. passport to see her parents. During her six-week stay in March/April 2005, she visited\nwith relatives, including a short visit of no more than a few hours with her father\u2019s half-brother at\nhis home. Otherwise, she spent her time quietly at her parents\u2019 home, socializing with her parents\nand reading books.\nOn her return from Nepal, Applicant worked in a local sandwich shop for a couple of months\nto pay the bills. In August 2005, she started her present job. She was informed that she would have\nto apply for a security clearance, and she completed an electronic questionnaire for investigations\nprocessing (e-QIP Attachment) on August 2, 2005. Applicant disclosed the Nepali citizenship of\nseveral family members (spouse, brother and his wife, parents, and mother-in-law), and the Nepali\nresidency of her parents. She indicated that her father-in-law had become a naturalized U.S. citizen,\nand her mother-in-law had her \u201cgreen card.\u201d Her brother was in the U.S. on an H1 (temporary\nemployment) visa and being sponsored for permanent residency by his employer while his spouse\nwas in the U.S. on an H2 (also temporary employment) visa. Applicant also listed foreign travel to\nNepal from March to April 2005 to see her parents, and to Canada with her immediate family for one\nweek in July 2003. Applicant was granted an interim secret-level security clearance.\nOn March 24, 2006, Applicant was interviewed by a government investigator concerning her\nforeign relatives. Applicant indicated that her parents had lived in the U.S. from 1998 to 2001,\nalternating their time between her and her brother\u2019s residences. They had never applied for U.S.\ncitizenship, although her father held a \u201cgreen card\u201d and worked briefly part-time for a discount\nretailer when he was in the U.S. Applicant added that one uncle in Nepal was a chief district officer\nfor the government, but that she and her parents had \u201cvery infrequent and superficial\u201d contact with\nhim. (Ex. 2) Applicant related that her parents respect and support the policies of the U.S.\nApplicant was reinterviewed on November 10, 2006, to discuss her parents\u2019 Nepali\ncitizenship and her contacts with them. She reported that she telephones them two times per week,\nbut added that neither of her parents had any government affiliation.\nApplicant was asked by DOHA to authenticate the information previously provided her\nduring subject interviews. In her response of June 1, 2007, Applicant indicated the information was\naccurate but added that her mother also held a \u201cgreen card\u201d while she was living in the U.S., and that\nher brother and his spouse had become U.S. permanent residents as of summer 2006.\nApplicant\u2019s parents have been back in the U.S. since September 2007. They are staying with\nApplicant\u2019s brother and his wife but sometimes spend the weekends with Applicant and her family\nso they can spend time with their granddaughters. Applicant hopes they will decide to remain in the\n\n5\nU.S. They are here on a one year visa. When they were in Nepal, she telephoned them once or twice\nweekly. Her parents know she is a computer software engineer but are not aware of her employer.\nThey are now retired, and are not politically active in Nepal. They own the home they have lived in\nsince Applicant was born. They have complained to Applicant about inflation and the random\nviolence in Nepal (\u201cmy mom says that if dad goes out for a walk, she is always, she doesn\u2019t know\nwhether he will come back or not because of the random violence that she mentioned.\u201d Tr. 82). \nAs of November 2007, her father\u2019s half-brother had lost his position as chief district official\ndue to a change in government. Applicant does not know whether he is working for a governmental\nentity in Nepal, as her parents mentioned to her only that he had been ousted from his position.\nApplicant\u2019s contact with this uncle is limited to brief visits when she is in Nepal and to brief\nconversations with him if he happens to be at his mother\u2019s home when she calls her father\u2019s\nstepmother during the festival of Dasai, which is similar to Christmas. None of Applicant\u2019s relatives\nin Nepal has asked her about her work in the U.S., but some family members inquired if she could\nassist them in immigrating to the U.S. (\u201cbecause life in Nepal is really hard and they wanted to make,\nthey think it\u2019s really easy here and dollars grow on trees, so they wanted to come here.\u201d Tr. 66).\nApplicant has told them she is unable to help them.\n Applicant\u2019s brother works as a computer software engineer in the U.S. He and his spouse\nacquired lawful permanent residency in the U.S. in summer 2006. They are expecting their first\nchild.\nApplicant is registered to vote in the U.S. and she has voted in elections. She does not intend\nto return to Nepal to live. In the event of any improper contact or pressure placed on her parents,\nApplicant averred she would immediately report the contact to security personnel at work. She loves\nher job and does not want to jeopardize it or her family. She did not violate any regulations or\nprocedures while she held the interim clearance. Applicant has no foreign financial assets or\ninvestments. She owns her home, has bank accounts, and has a 401(k) retirement plan through work.\nHer children attend local public schools. Applicant has little time for involvement in professional\norganizations, although she would like to join an organization of women in technology. She has two\nclasses remaining to earn her master\u2019s degree in computer science and plans to finish within a year.\nNepali is primarily spoken in her home.\nIn 2006, Applicant\u2019s spouse went to Nepal because he had not been there since 1989. He\nreturned to Nepal in 2007 to sell property that his mother had given him. He brought the proceeds\nof the sale to the U.S. Applicant did not accompany him on either of these trips. As of November\n2007, her spouse was a stay-at-home father and considering starting his own business. Applicant\u2019s\nsalary was sufficient to cover their living expenses. All members of her spouse\u2019s immediate family\nreside in the U.S.\n \nNepal is an ethnically diverse country wedged between the People\u2019s Republic of China and\nthe Republic of India. Formerly governed by the monarch under a hierarchical system of councils\n(panchayats), Nepal was established as a parliamentary democracy under a constitutional monarch\nin November 1990. Due to dissension in the governing Nepali Congress Party, the parliament was\ndissolved in mid-1994. When elections produced no majority, Nepal became the world\u2019s first\ncommunist monarchy. The next five years saw five successive unstable coalition governments. In\nFebruary 1996, the Communist Maoist United People\u2019s Front began a violent insurgency, waged\n\n6\nthrough killings, torture, bombings, kidnappings, extortion, and intimidation against civilians, police,\nand public officials. \u201cImperialist\u201d U.S. and \u201cexpansionist\u201d India were the targets of considerable\nMaoist venom. Cease fires in 2001 and 2003 were broken by the Maoists. In February 2005, the king\ndismissed the Cabinet, constituted a Council of Ministers under his own chairmanship, and\nsuspended all fundamental rights for nearly three months. In April 2006, massive countrywide\ndemonstrations organized by the major political parties in cooperation with the Maoists forced the\nking to relinquish power and to reinstate the 1999 parliament. In November 2006, the Maoists\nentered into a comprehensive peace agreement with the Nepalese government to end the decade long\ninsurgency. On January 15, 2007, an interim parliament was constituted and an interim constitution\nendorsed. On April 1, 2007, the ruling eight-party government through political consensus formed\nan interim Council of Ministers that includes five Maoist ministers.\nThe interim constitution, which transferred all powers of king as head of state to the prime\nminister, expresses full commitment to democratic ideals and norms, including competitive\nmultiparty democracy, civil liberties, fundamental human rights, adult enfranchisement, periodic\nelections, press freedom, an independent judiciary, and the rule of law. Incidents of human rights\nviolations by government security forces, which had been numerous and grave before April 2006,\ndeclined substantially, while Maoists continued to engage in violence, extortion,  abductions, and\nforced recruitment of schoolchildren. Sporadic incidents of terrorism and politically-motivated\nviolence in major urban areas, including near-simultaneous blasts of improvised explosive devices\nat three locations in the capital Kathmandu on September 2, 2007, led the U.S. Department of State\nto warn U.S. citizens contemplating travel to Nepal. Ethnic tensions in the Terai region led to\nrandom, indiscriminate violent clashes between Maoist splinter groups and indigenous groups\ndisrupting trade and travel in that area and to closures of the southern border with India. Maoist\ndemonstrators have stopped and in some cases attacked diplomatic vehicles, including those of the\nU.S. Embassy. In November 2006, resident Americans reported being told they would have to house\nand feed Maoists intending to participate in rallies in Kathmandu, and in a few cases, their local\nNepali staffs have been threatened or beaten when they attempted to resist this demand. Since early\n2007, the Maoist Young Communist League has threatened the Kathmandu-based personnel of a\nU.S. non-governmental organization.\nThe U.S. has designated the Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist) as a global terrorist\norganization. Maoists are excluded from the U.S. and U.S. citizens are barred by law from\ncontributing funds, goods, or services to, or for the benefit of, the Maoists. The Government of Nepal\nformally lifted its designation of the Maoists as a terrorist organization on May 3, 2006. As of 2007,\nthe U.S. is the only country to maintain its designation of the Maoist insurgency as a terrorist\norganization.\nNepal is a member of the United Nations and of the World Trade Organization. Relations\nbetween the U.S. and Nepal have always been friendly. Since 1951, the U.S. has provided more than\n$791 million in bilateral economic assistance to Nepal. Nepal also receives substantial external\nassistance from India, the United Kingdom, Japan, Germany, and the Scandinavian countries. The\nNepalese Army has contributed significantly to UN peacekeeping missions. The U.S. has given\n$21.95 million in grant assistance to the Nepalese Army, and many Nepalese Army officers attend\nU.S. military schools, conferences, and seminars. Nepal has generally had good bilateral relations\nwith China since 1956. Nepal has traditionally had close relations with India because of strong\n\n7\ncultural, religious, linguistic and economic ties. India and Nepal restored trade relations in 1990 after\na break caused by India\u2019s concerns over Nepal\u2019s relationship with China.\nPOLICIES\n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S.\n518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has \u201cthe authority to . . . control access to\ninformation bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently\ntrustworthy to occupy a position . . . that will give that person access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527.\nThe President authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants eligibility for\naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb.\n20, 1960). An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with\nthe national interest to grant or continue [her] security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3\n(App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002).\nThe revised Adjudicative Guidelines set forth potentially disqualifying conditions (DC) and\nmitigating conditions (MC) under each guideline. In evaluating the security worthiness of an\napplicant, the administrative judge must also assess the adjudicative process factors listed in \u00b6 6.3\nof the Directive. The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a\ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant. See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. It is merely an indication\nthe applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have\nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nCONCLUSIONS\nGuideline B\u2014Foreign Influence\nUnder Guideline B,  foreign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual\nhas divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or induced to help a foreign\nperson, group, organization, or government that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure\nor coercion by any foreign interest. Adjudication under this Guideline can and should consider the\nidentity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or financial interest is located, including,\nbut not limited to, such considerations as to whether the foreign country is known to target United\nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a risk of terrorism. (AG \u00b6\n6) Applicant\u2019s spouse is a citizen of Nepal (SOR \u00b6 1.a); her parents are resident citizens of Nepal\n(SOR \u00b6 1.b). Although they have been in the U.S. since September 2007 due to the pending birth of\ntheir grandchild and are again considering immigrating to the U.S., they have not decided to remain\npermanently. Disqualifying condition (DC) \u00b6 7(a) (contact with a foreign family member, business\nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a foreign country\nif that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure,\nor coercion) applies.\nIn SOR \u00b6 1.c, the government alleged concerns of potential foreign influence because of her\nfather\u2019s employment in the U.S. from about 1998 to about 2001 and with India\u2019s embassy in Nepal\n\n8\nbefore 2001. The evidence shows that Applicant\u2019s father worked part-time at a local discount retailer\nfor a brief period while he and his spouse were living in the U.S. as lawful permanent residents. He\nworked so as not to be completely dependent on Applicant and/or her brother. It is difficult to see\nwhere this part-time retail work in the U.S. generates any foreign influence concern. As for her\nfather\u2019s former employment in Nepal for the Indian embassy, his duties distributing and auditing\npension benefits for Nepalis that served in India\u2019s army appear to have been routine but they would\nhave brought him into contact with foreign government employees. However, Applicant also\ntestified, unchallenged by the government, that her father quit that job in about 1986. There is no\nevidence that he has any ongoing contact with any of his former coworkers or with anyone presently\nemployed by a foreign government.\nApplicant traveled to Nepal as alleged in 1992, 1997, and 2005 (SOR \u00b6 1.d). Routine contacts\nwith officials at the border do not raise the concerns contemplated within DC \u00b6 7(j) (conduct,\nespecially while traveling outside the U.S., which may make the individual vulnerable to\nexploitation, pressure, or coercion by a foreign person, group, government, or country). While she\nvisited with extended family members, including the uncle who was a chief district officer, these\nvisits were brief. Her primary contacts were with her parents, and her travel is relevant to the extent\nit confirms the closeness of her bonds with them.\nThe risk presented by the Nepali citizenship of Applicant\u2019s spouse is  mitigated by his lawful\npermanent residency in the U.S., and his limited contacts with Nepal. His immediate family members\nall reside in the U.S.  While he traveled to Nepal twice in recent years, Applicant testified credibly\nthat her spouse went to Nepal in 2006 because he had not been to his native Nepal for some 17 years\nand he returned in 2007 to sell property that his mother had given him in Nepal. There is no evidence\nthat he has any ongoing contact with any persons in Nepal. Mitigating condition \u00b6 8(a) (the nature\nof the relationships with the foreign persons, the country in which these persons are located, or the\npositions or activities of those persons in the country are such that it is unlikely the individual will\nbe placed in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, group,\norganization, or government and the interests of the U.S.) applies.\nApplicant\u2019s bonds of affection with her parents are too strong to fall within the first prong\nof MC \u00b6 8(a). When they are in Nepal, she telephones them once or twice weekly. The political\nsituation in Nepal remains a relevant consideration, despite their visitor status in the U.S. since\nSeptember 2007. Given their past difficulty acclimating to life in the U.S., there is no guarantee that\nthey will not return to Nepal in or before September 2008 when their visas expire. Nepal has\nhistorically had good relations with the U.S. It is a member of the United Nations and of the World\nTrade Organization, and it has contributed forces to UN peacekeeping missions. Nepal also does not\nhave a history of aggressively targeting U.S. economic or intelligence information, and there has\nbeen considerable improvement in human rights. However, following its decade-long insurgency,\nMaoists are now recognized by, and are part of, the government of Nepal. Sporadic incidents of\nterrorism and politically-motivated violence in major urban areas of Nepal led the U.S. Department\nof State in September 2007 to warn U.S. citizens contemplating travel to Nepal. Applicant\u2019s mother\nrecently expressed to Applicant her concern over random violence in their home city of Kathmandu.\nApplicant argues for a distinction between the risk to physical security that exists in an\nunstable environment, and the types of concern that rise to the level of compromising Applicant\u2019s\nability to safeguard national security. Applicant\u2019s position makes sense only if terrorism is viewed\n\n9\nsolely as a criminal activity. Terrorism is not limited to indiscriminate acts of violence intended to\nincite fear. It often has political aims, and where it is allowed to operate unchecked or is condoned\none has to question the ability and/or willingness of a government to protect its citizens against\ninterference, coercion, or other abuses. Under Guideline B, the risk of terrorism within a foreign\ncountry is a relevant consideration independent of whether the foreign country is known to target\nU.S. citizens to obtain protected information. There is nothing about her parents\u2019 activities when they\nare in Nepal that heightens the risk, but given her strong feelings of affection for her parents (she\ncontinues to urge them to stay in the U.S.) and the official recognition and involvement of the\nMaoists in Nepal, I am unable to conclude with a reasonable degree of certainty that Applicant is\nunlikely to be placed in a position of having to choose between her parents and the interests of the\nU.S.\nThe risk of undue foreign influence presented by Applicant\u2019s affections for her family\nmembers may yet be mitigated by countervailing strong ties in the U.S. (See MC \u00b6 8(b) (there is no\nconflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of loyalty or obligation to the foreign\nperson, group, government, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and\nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve\nany conflict of interest in the U.S.)). The issue underlying MC \u00b6 8(b) is whether Applicant can be\ncounted on to do the right thing in the face of any undue foreign influence. \nSince immigrating to the U.S. in 1989, Applicant has developed very significant ties to the\nU.S. that she is not likely to jeopardize (education, career, home ownership, citizenship). She chose\nto become a U.S. citizen with the understanding she would no longer be a citizen of Nepal, in part\nso that she could sponsor her parents\u2019 immigration to the U.S. While working full-time, she has\npursued her master\u2019s degree in computer science so that she can take advantage of opportunities that\nare not available to her in Nepal. Her two daughters are both native U.S. citizens who count on\nApplicant, not only for parental guidance, but for financial support. Consistent with the whole person\nevaluation required under AG \u00b6 2(a), it is noted that Applicant held an interim secret clearance and\ndid not violate the government\u2019s trust. She testified credibly that in the event of any undue foreign\ninfluence, she would notify her employer\u2019s security office (\u201cI know what I have to do. I love my job\nand I would do anything to protect my job, and this is my home, I don\u2019t want to hurt this.\u201d Tr. 61).\nApplicant\u2019s commitment to her life in the U.S. is evident. So while she does have close bonds to her\nparents who may return to their native Nepal, she can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest\nin favor of the U.S. interest. MC \u00b6 8(b) applies.\n\n10\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nParagraph 1.

On August 13, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and\nAppeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns\nunder Guideline F concerning the Applicant.  The action was taken under Executive\nOrder 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960),\nas amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel\nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the\nrevised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by President Bush on December 29,\n2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September\n1, 2006. \n \nApplicant submitted Answers to the SOR on September 11, 2007, and November\n16, 2007, and requested a hearing before an Administrative Judge.  Department\nCounsel was prepared to proceed on January 13, 2008.  I received the case\nassignment on January 25, 2008.  DOHA issued a notice of hearing on February 6,\n2008, and I convened the hearing as scheduled on March 4, 2008.  The Government\n\n2\noffered Government Exhibits 1 through 10, which were received without objection.\nApplicant testified on his own behalf, called one witness, and submitted Applicant\u2019s\nExhibits A and B, without objection. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing on\nMarch 14, 2008.  The record closed on that date.  Based upon a review of the case file,\npleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified information is\ndenied.\nFindings of Fact\nThe Applicant is 29, divorced and has a high school diploma.  He has one child\nwith his ex-wife, and another child with his current girlfriend.  He is employed by a\ndefense contractor as a Refurbisher and seeks to retain a security clearance in\nconnection with his employment.\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe Applicant admits all of the allegations in the SOR.

The witness did not believe the Applicant to be any kind of a\nsecurity risk.  (Transcript at 61-71.)  \nPolicies\nSecurity clearance decisions are not made in a vacuum.  When evaluating an\nApplicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the Administrative Judge must consider\nthe revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief introductory explanations for\neach guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and\nmitigating conditions, which are useful in evaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access\nto classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.  In addition, the Administrative Judge may also rely on his own\ncommon sense, as well as his knowledge of the law, human nature, and the ways of the\nworld, in making a reasoned decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Security clearance decisions include, by\nnecessity, consideration of the possible risk that the Applicant may deliberately or\n\n6\ninadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a\ncertain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk\nof compromise of classified information.\n \nFinally, as emphasized by President Eisenhower in Section 7 of Executive Order\n10865, \u201cAny determination under this order . . . shall be a determination in terms of the\nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set\nout in AG &18:      \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nAG &19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.\nSimilarly under AG &19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise\nsecurity concerns. The Applicant has over $25,000.00 in past due debts, which have\nbeen due and owing for several years. The evidence is sufficient to raise these\npotentially disqualifying conditions, requiring a closer examination.\nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security\nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG \u00b620(a), the disqualifying condition\nmay be mitigated where Athe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or\noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt\non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ Applicant=s\nfinancial difficulties arose primarily between about 2001 and 2004.  However, the\nApplicant made no attempt to even begin to try to pay these debts voluntarily until just\nbefore the hearing.  This mitigating condition is not applicable to this case.  \nThe Applicant has barely begun any efforts to use the Service to resolve his\nindebtedness.  As of the date of the hearing, he had not even completed compiling the\npaper work the Service needs to do their job.  Under the particular facts of this case, I\ncannot find that the Applicant has initiated a good-faith effort to pay off his creditors.\nAccordingly, AG \u00b620(d) is not applicable. \n\n7\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances.  The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b62(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation\nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent\nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d\nUnder AG \u00b62(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case.  The Applicant is a hard-working,\nhighly respected, professional person who has made poor decisions concerning his\ndebts.  Just as an example, one of the Applicant\u2019s debts is for $27.00.  This debt has\nbeen owing for five years.  Even after receiving the SOR, the Applicant has made no\nattempt to pay this very small debt.\nOf course, the issue is not simply whether all the Applicant\u2019s debts are paid - it is\nwhether his financial circumstances raise concerns about his fitness to hold a security\nclearance.  Under AG \u00b62(a)(3), this conduct is recent.  Given the Applicant\u2019s complete\nfailure to begin to resolve these debts until just days before the hearing, I cannot find\nthat there have been permanent behavioral changes under AG \u00b62(a)(6).  Accordingly, at\nthe present time, I cannot find that there is little to no potential for pressure, coercion,\nexploitation, or duress (AG \u00b62(a)8)); or that the likelihood of recurrence is close to nil\n(AG \u00b62(a)9)). \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and/or doubts as to\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I\nconclude the Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns arising from his financial\nconsiderations.  \nOn balance, it is concluded that the Applicant has not successfully overcome the\nGovernment's case opposing his request for a DoD security clearance.  Accordingly, the\nevidence supports a finding against the Applicant as to the factual and conclusionary\nallegations expressed in Paragraph 1 of the Government's Statement of Reasons.\n\n8\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST THE APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a. through 1.p.:\nAgainst the Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n                                              \n_________________\nWILFORD H. ROSS\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Clearance is granted. \n \nHistory of Case \n \nApplicant submitted his Security Clearance Application (SF-86), on November \n30, 2005. On July 13, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) \nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under Guideline \nC (Foreign Preference) and Guideline B (Foreign Influence) for Applicant. The action \nwas taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, \nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the \nPresident on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for \nSORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \nFebruary 27, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \n \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on July 20, 2007. He answered the \nSOR in writing on July 30, 2007, and requested a decision on his security clearance \napplication be made based on the written record. On August 20, 2007, pursuant to \nParagraph E3.1.7 of the Additional Procedural Guidance of the Directive, Department \nCounsel requested this case be converted to a hearing to \u201cadequately develop the \nfacts.\u201d Department Counsel was prepared to proceed on August 30, 2007, and the case \nwas assigned to another administrative judge on November 2, 2007. On November 2, \n2007, DOHA issued a notice of hearing scheduling the case to be heard on November \n14, 2007. The case was reassigned to me on November 6, 2007. On November 7, \n2008, DOHA issued a notice canceling the November 14, 2007 hearing. On November \n16, 2007, DOHA issued a notice of hearing scheduling the case to be heard on \nDecember 20, 2007. The hearing was held as scheduled.  \n \nThe government offered Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 3, which were \nreceived without objection. Applicant testified on his own behalf, and offered Applicant \nExhibit (AE) A, which was received without objection. I granted Applicant\u2019s request to \nkeep the record open until December 20, 2007, to submit additional matters.  The \nApplicant timely submitted AE B through K, which were received without objection. The \nrecord closed on December 20, 2007. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) \non January 4, 2008. \n \nProcedural and Evidentiary Rulings \n \nRequest for Administrative Notice \n \nDepartment Counsel submitted a formal request that I take administrative notice \nof certain facts relating to Malta contained in Exs. I through III. Applicant had no \nobjection and I took administrative notice of the documents offered by Department \nCounsel, which pertain to Malta. Tr. 12-14. \n \nAdministrative or official notice is the appropriate type of notice used for \nadministrative proceedings. See ISCR Case No. 05-11292 at 4 n.1 (App. Bd. Apr. 12, \n2007); ISCR Case No. 02-24875 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2006) (citing ISCR Case No. \n02-18668 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 10, 2004); McLeod v. Immigration and Naturalization  \nService, 802 F.2d 89, 93 n.4 (3d Cir. 1986)). The most common basis for administrative \nnotice at ISCR proceedings, is to notice facts that are either well known or from \ngovernment reports. See Stein, Administrative Law, Section 25.01 (Bender & Co. 2006) \n(listing fifteen types of facts for administrative notice). Various facts administratively \nnoticed pertaining to Malta were derived from Exs. I through III as indicated under \nsubheading \u201cMalta\u201d of this decision.   \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n  \nIn his Answer to the SOR dated July 13, 2007, Applicant admitted all of the \nfactual allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. through 1.d., and 2.a. through 2.e. \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \nApplicant is a 59-year-old maintenance class 1 worker, who has been employed \nby the same defense contractor since January 1972, a period of 36 years. He has \nsuccessfully held a security clearance since March 1995, a period of 13 years. AE B. He \nseeks to renew his security clearance. He also holds a courier certificate, which \nauthorizes him to transport classified material from his place of employment to the U.S. \nPost Office. Tr. 44-45, AE K. \n \nApplicant was born in 1948 in Malta to Maltese parents. He was raised in a rural \nagricultural community on the Island of Gozo, which is north of the main Island of Malta. \nAfter completing the 6th grade, he went to work on the family farm. Tr. 17-18. In 1971, at \nage 23, he left Malta and joined his sister in Canada, who was living there at the time. \nAfter joining his sister, he secured employment with the railroad for a brief period. In \n1972, he immigrated to the U.S. to join his parents and two other siblings, who had \nrecently left Malta and were residing in the U.S.  \n \nApplicant became a naturalized U.S. citizen in May 1984, and applied for a U.S. \npassport shortly after becoming a citizen. He renewed his most recent and current U.S. \npassport in January 2001. GE 1. As a result of his birth, Applicant is a dual citizen of \nMalta and the U.S. He holds a Malta passport issued in March 2002 with an expiration \ndate in March 2012. He obtained a Malta passport for ease of travel within Malta and \nalso to prove his Malta citizenship for inheritance purposes, discussed infra. SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.a. through d.  \n \nApplicant married in August 1978. His wife, like him, was born and raised in \nMalta, and became a U.S. citizen. She was a career police officer in a major U.S. \nmetropolitan city. Applicant and his wife separated in 2005. His estranged wife moved \nback to Malta in approximately June 2007, and filed for divorce before she left. Post-\nhearing, Applicant submitted a Judgment of Divorce reflecting his divorce was final in \nNovember 2007. AE J.  \n \nApplicant has two unmarried adult U.S.-born children, a 27-year-old son, and a \n23-year-old daughter. Both children currently reside with Applicant. Tr. 23. Applicant has \na married 49-year-old brother, who resides in the U.S. He maintains contact with his \nbrother primarily by telephone, averaging once a month. Applicant also has a married \n54-year-old sister, who resides in the U.S. and lives nearby. Applicant sees his sister \nand her family \u201conce a week, sometimes every two weeks.\u201d Applicant also \ncommunicates with this sister frequently by telephone. Tr. 43, 52-53.  \n \nApplicant has two immediate family members, who are citizens and residents of \nMalta. The first is his 83-year-old widowed mother, and the second is his 61 year old \nsister. SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a. and 2.b.  Applicant\u2019s mother lived in the U.S. from approximately \n1972 to 1988, and returned to Malta approximately 20 years ago. She lives on the \nfamily farm in Malta. When she lived in the U.S., she worked as a cleaning lady for a \nmajor department store. She is not connected or associated with anyone in the Malta \ngovernment. She supports herself on her U.S. social security, which she earned during \nher working life in the U.S. Tr. 30-32. \n\n \n4 \n \n \nApplicant traveled to Malta primarily to visit his mother in August 1999, August \n2000, August 2001, August 2002, August 2003, and December 2004. SOR \u00b6 2.e. \nAlthough not alleged, Applicant visited his mother in Malta in July 2007. Tr. 33. \nApplicant stayed with his mother during his visits to Malta. Applicant communicates with \nhis mother by telephone approximately three-to-four times per week. While visiting his \nmother in Malta, he visited his sister and her family. His sister and brother-in-law are not \nconnected with or associated with the Malta government. His sister is a housewife and \nhis brother-in-law is a retired plumber. They live off his brother-in-law\u2019s pension and \nraise goats. Tr. 34-37, GE 3. Applicant communicates with his sister \u201cmaybe once [a \nyear] [at] Christmas.\u201d Tr. 37, 52. He does not visit his former in-laws because \u201c[he does \nnot] get along with them [any] more.\u201d Tr. 35. \n \nAs noted supra, Applicant holds a current Malta passport. Applicant used his \nMalta passport for the sole purpose of obtaining a less expensive domestic helicopter \nflight from the Island of Malta to the Island of Gozo, where his mother lives. After \nbecoming a U.S. citizen, he used his U.S. passport when traveling to and from Malta. \nTr. 25-28, 39, 51-52. In December 2007, Applicant surrendered his Malta passport to \nhis Facility Security Manager in order to comply with the Guidelines. His Facility \nSecurity Manager secured Applicant\u2019s Malta passport in a company safe, and further \nstated he would make a Joint Personnel Adjudication System (JPAS) entry if Applicant \nrequested the return of his Malta passport. Tr. 51, AE A. Applicant also believes holding \na Malta passport would ease the process of inheriting his portion of the family farm in \nMalta when his mother passes away. Applicant anticipates splitting his inheritance with \ntwo other siblings. Tr. 28-30. \n \nApplicant stated he would be willing to renounce his Malta citizenship. Tr. 50. \nApplicant further added that he would be willing to give up his Malta citizenship knowing \nthat it would preclude him from obtaining his inheritance. Tr. 69-70.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s Facility Security Manager testified on Applicant\u2019s behalf. He stated he \nhas known and worked with the Applicant for 25 years, and described him as an \n\u201coutstanding\u201d employee. He added Applicant is \u201cvery efficient\u201d and has never had a \nsecurity violation during his 36 years of employment with their company. He \nrecommended Applicant\u2019s security clearance be renewed. Applicant is well known \nthroughout the company and enjoys a reputation as \u201c[v]ery respectful, very trustworthy.\u201d \nTr. 57-58, 62-63, 67. Applicant\u2019s last five years of work performance evaluations \ndocument above average performance or performance that exceeds expectations. AE C \nthrough G. \n  \nAll of Applicant\u2019s financial interests are in the U.S., which includes a home valued \nat $800k, a 401(k) retirement account valued at $360k, a checking account with a \nbalance of $5k and savings account with a balance of $80k. He has no financial ties to \nMalta other than a savings account with a balance of approximately $20k. Tr. 40-42, 59. \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \n                                                          \nApplicant emphasized his loyalty to the U.S. He enjoys and appreciates his way \nof life in the U.S. and has embraced being a U.S. citizen. He exercises his rights as a \nU.S. citizen to include voting.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s attitude is best summarized, \u201cI like it here (referring to the U.S.) My \nspecial connection is here.\u201d Tr. 66. \n \nMALTA1 \n \n \nNo indigenous terrorist or extremist groups are known to be active in Malta, and \nno foreign terrorist organization has carried out an attack against U.S. interests in Malta \nin recent years. Malta has a low rate of crime. Under its 1964 constitution, Malta \nbecame a parliamentary democracy within the Commonwealth. Queen Elizabeth was \nsovereign of Malta, and a governor general exercised executive authority on her behalf, \nwhile the actual direction and control of the government and the nation\u2019s affairs were in \nthe hands of the cabinet under the leadership of a Maltese prime minister. \n \n \nOn December 13, 1974, the constitution was revised, and Malta became a \nrepublic within the Commonwealth, with executive authority vested in a Maltese \npresident. The president is appointed by parliament. In turn, he appoints as prime \nminister the leader of the party that wins a majority of seats in a general election for the \nunicameral House of Representatives. Two parties dominate Malta\u2019s polarized and \nevenly divided politics \u2013 the Nationalist Party and the Malta Labor Party. \n \n \nPossessing few indigenous raw materials and a very small domestic market, \nMalta has based its economic development on the promotion of tourism, accounting for \nroughly 30% of GDP, and exports of manufactured goods, mainly semi-conductors, \nwhich account for some 75% of total Maltese exports. Since the beginning of the 1990s, \nexpansion in these activities has been the principal engine for strong growth in the \nMaltese economy.  \n \n \nMalta\u2019s diplomatic and consular representation includes accreditation to 143 \nforeign countries and international organizations. Malta is host to 20 resident diplomatic \nmissions, and 118 countries have non-resident diplomatic representation. With its \ncentral location in the Mediterranean, Malta has long portrayed itself as a bridge \nbetween Europe and North Africa, particularly Libya, with whom it has enjoyed positive \ndiplomatic and commercial ties. Malta is one of the southernmost points of the \nEuropean Union. Malta continues to be an active participant in the United Nations, the \nCommonwealth, the Council of Europe, OSCE, and various other international \norganizations. Among these entities, Malta has frequently expressed its concern for the \npeace and economic development of the Mediterranean region. The Nationalist Party \ngovernment is continuing a policy of neutrality and nonalignment but in a Western \ncontext. The government desires close relations with the United States, with an \n \n1The contents of this section are taken in whole or in part from Exs. I through III.  \n\n \n6 \n \n \nemphasis on increased trade and private investment. U.S. Navy ships resumed liberty \ncalls in 1992 and currently visit on a regular basis. \n \n \nMalta and the United States established full diplomatic relations upon Malta\u2019s \nindependence in 1964; overall relations are currently active and cordial. The United \nStates has been sympathetic to Malta\u2019s campaign to attract private investment, and \nsome firms operating in Malta have U.S. ownership or investment. These include major \nhotels, manufacturing and repair facilities, and some offices servicing local and regional \noperations. \n \nPolicies \n \nIn an evaluation of an applicant\u2019s security or trustworthiness suitability, an \nadministrative judge must consider the \u201cAdjudicative Guidelines for Determining \nEligibility For Access to Classified Information\u201d (AG(s)). The AGs include brief \nintroductory explanations for each AG, and provide specific disqualifying conditions and \nmitigating conditions. \n \nThese Guidelines are not inflexible ironclad rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, an administrative judge should apply these guidelines \nin conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. AG \u00b6 2. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common \nsense decision. Because the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of \nvariables known as the \u201cwhole person concept,\u201d an administrative judge should consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. AG \u00b6 2(c). \n \n \nSpecifically, an administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative \nprocess factors listed at AGs \u00b6 2(a): \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and \nother permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n  \n \nSince the protection of the national security is the paramount consideration, the \nfinal decision in each case is arrived at by applying the standard that \u201c[a]ny doubt \nconcerning personnel being considered for access to classified [or sensitive] information \nwill be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d AG \u00b6 2(b). In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \n\n \n7 \n \n \n                                                          \nIn the decision-making process, the Government has the initial burden of \nestablishing controverted facts by \u201csubstantial evidence,\u201d2 demonstrating, in accordance \nwith the Directive, that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or \ncontinue an applicant\u2019s access to classified information. Once the Government has \nproduced substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, the burden shifts to Applicant \nto produce evidence \u201cto rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by \napplicant or proven by Department Counsel, and [applicant] has the ultimate burden of \npersuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The \nburden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR \nCase No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).3 \n \nA person seeking access to classified or sensitive information enters into a \nfiduciary relationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. It is \nbecause of this special relationship the government must be able to repose a high \ndegree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to such \ninformation. Decisions under this Directive include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified or sensitive information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of such \ninformation. \n  \nThe scope of an administrative judge\u2019s decision is limited. Nothing in this \nDecision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole or in \npart, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or \npatriotism.  Executive Order 10865, \u00a7 7.  \n \n  \nAnalysis \n \n \n \nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all \nappropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, including those described briefly \nabove, I conclude the following with respect to the allegations set forth in the SOR: \n \n \n \n \n2 \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as \nadequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the record.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 04-\n11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1). \u201cThis is something less than the weight \nof the evidence, and the possibility of drawing two inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not \nprevent [a Judge\u2019s] finding from being supported by substantial evidence.\u201d Consolo v. Federal Maritime \nComm\u2019n, 383 U.S. 607, 620 (1966). \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a \npreponderance.\u201d See v. Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). \n \n3\u201cThe Administrative Judge [considers] the record evidence as a whole, both favorable and \nunfavorable, evaluate[s] Applicant\u2019s past and current circumstances in light of pertinent provisions of the \nDirective, and decide[s] whether Applicant ha[s] met his burden of persuasion under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 04-10340 at 2 (App. Bd. July 6, 2006).  \n\n \n8 \n \n \nGuideline C (Foreign Preference) \n \nAG \u00b6 9 explains the Government\u2019s concern regarding Foreign Preference,   \n\u201c[w]hen an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a foreign country \nover the United States, then he or she may be prone to provide information or make \ndecisions that are harmful to the interests of the United States.\u201d \n \n AG \u00b6 10(a) indicates two conditions that raise potential security concerns and \nmay be disqualifying in this case, \u201c(a) exercise of any right, privilege or obligation of \nforeign citizenship after becoming a U.S. citizen or through the foreign citizenship of a \nfamily member. This includes but is not limited to:  (1) possession of a current foreign \npassport; . . . and (5) using foreign citizenship to protect financial or business interests \nin another country.\u201d \n \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. through 1.d. alleged Applicant held dual citizenship with Malta and \nthe U.S., that he applied for and possessed a valid Malta passport after becoming a \nU.S. citizen, and that he possessed a Malta passport for travel to Malta and to prove \nMalta citizenship for inheritance rights. \n \n \nThe Government produced substantial evidence of this disqualifying condition, \nand the burden shifted to Applicant to produce evidence and prove a mitigating \ncondition. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the \nGovernment. \n \n \nThree Foreign Preference Mitigating Conditions under AG \u00b6 11 are potentially \napplicable to these disqualifying conditions: \n \n(a) dual citizenship is based solely on parents\u2019 citizenship or birth in a \nforeign country;   \n \n(b) the individual has expressed a willingness to renounce dual \ncitizenship; and \n \n(e) the passport has been destroyed, surrendered to the cognizant \nsecurity authority or otherwise invalidated. \n \nAG \u00b6 11(a) potentially applies because Applicant derived his citizenship as a \nresult of his birth, and heritage to Malta.  However, it does not apply because he \nobtained a Maltese passport after becoming a U.S. citizen. \n \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 11(b) and (e) fully apply.  Applicant expressed a sincere willingness, \nwithout qualifications, to renounce his Malta citizenship, even if it meant the loss of  \nfamily inheritance. Applicant\u2019s use of his Malta passport was limited to obtaining a \ndomestic discounted helicopter ride from the Island of Malta to the Island of Gozo, \nwhere his mother and sister live. This discounted fare is apparently only available to \ncitizens of Malta. After becoming a U.S. citizen, and obtaining a U.S. passport, he used \n\n \n9 \n \n \nhis U.S. passport for travel to and from Malta. Furthermore, Applicant surrendered his \npassport to his Facility Security Manager, where it is secured in a company safe. The \nFacility Security Manager stated he will make the appropriate notification to JPAS if \nApplicant requests the return of his Malta passport. \n \nGuideline B (Foreign Influence) \n \n \nAG \u00b6 6 explains the Government\u2019s concern about \u201cforeign contacts and interests\u201d \nstating: \n \nIf the individual has divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, [he or \nshe] may be manipulated or induced to help a foreign person, group, \norganization, or government in a way that is not in U.S. interests, or is \nvulnerable to pressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Adjudication \nunder this Guideline can and should consider the identity of the foreign \ncountry in which the foreign contact or financial interest is located, \nincluding, but not limited to, such considerations as whether the foreign \ncountry is known to target United States citizens to obtain protected \ninformation and/or is associated with a risk of terrorism. \n \nAG \u00b6 7 indicates two conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case, including: \n \n(a) contact with a foreign family member, business or professional \nassociate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a \nforeign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign \nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to \nprotect sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s desire to \nhelp a foreign person, group, or country by providing that information. \n \nThe mere possession of close family ties with a person in a foreign country is not, \nas a matter of law, disqualifying under Guideline B. However, if only one relative lives in \na foreign country and an applicant has contacts with that relative, this factor alone is \nsufficient to create the potential for foreign influence and could potentially result in the \ncompromise of classified information. See ISCR Case No. 03-02382 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. \n15, 2006); ISCR Case No. 99-0424 (App. Bd. Feb. 8, 2001). Applicant has frequent \ncontact with his mother and his sister and her family in Malta. These close relationships \nwith these relatives create a potential risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, \nmanipulation, pressure, or coercion meriting a close examination of all circumstances. \n \n \nThe Government produced substantial evidence of these two disqualifying \nconditions primarily as it pertains to Applicant\u2019s contacts and relationship with his \nmother and sister, his travel to Malta, and his retaining a Malta passport to prove \n\n \n10 \n \n \ncitizenship to exercise his inheritance rights. The burden shifted to Applicant to produce \nevidence and prove a mitigating condition. As previously indicated, the burden of \ndisproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. \n \n \nThree Foreign Influence Mitigating Conditions under Guideline \u00b6 8 are potentially \napplicable to these disqualifying conditions: \n \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nU.S.;  \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country is \nso minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships \nand loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any \nconflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest; and \n \n(f) the value or routine nature of the foreign business, financial, or property \ninterests is such that they are unlikely to result in a conflict and could not \nbe used effectively to influence, manipulate, or pressure the individual. \n \nAG \u00b6 8(a) applies. Applicant\u2019s mother is elderly, lives on the family farm, is retired \nand derives her income from her U.S. social security. His sister and brother-in-law are \nalso retired, and they too live on a farm. They derive their income from raising goats and \nalso living off a pension. None of Applicant\u2019s immediate relatives living in Malta are \nconnected with or associated with the Malta Government. \n \nOn the other hand, Applicant does have close emotional ties to immediate family \nmembers in Malta, as evidenced by his frequent telephone calls and visits to Malta. \nWith regard to these family members, Applicant established \u201cit is unlikely [he] will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of [his parents] and the \ninterests of the U.S.\u201d If Malta had different environment and was like other countries \nhostile to the U.S., his frequent contacts with his immediate family members in Malta \ncould potentially force him to choose between the United States and Malta. On balance, \nhowever, he met his burden of showing there is \u201clittle likelihood that [his relationship \nwith his mother and sister] could create a risk for foreign influence or exploitation.\u201d Even \nif AG \u00b6 8(a) did not apply, the two other mitigating conditions apply, especially AG \u00b6 \n8(b). \n \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 8(b) and 8(f) fully apply. Applicant has lived in the U.S. for 36 years. He \nmarried in the U.S. and has two adult U.S.-born children, who live with him. He is \ncompletely vested in the U.S. His former wife also became a U.S. citizen, and has since \nreturned to Malta. Inasmuch as his divorce was final in November 2007, his connection \n\n \n11 \n \n \n                                                          \nto his former in-laws in Malta is no longer applicable.  Applicant has two siblings, who \nalong with their families, live in the U.S. He maintains a close relationship with both \nsiblings in the U.S., particularly with his sister and her family, who live nearby. He \nmaintains substantial real and personal property in the U.S. as compared to his \npersonal property in Malta and potential inheritance. Appellant has developed a \nsufficient relationship and loyalty to the U.S., as he can be expected to resolve any \nconflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest. He became a U.S. citizen in May 1984. \nApplicant has been employed by his defense contractor employer since January 1972, \nshortly after arriving in the U.S. and is very highly regarded at work. Applicant\u2019s contacts \nand linkage to the U.S. are much greater than his linkage to Malta. Furthermore, based \non the source documents the Government submitted, Malta and the U.S. enjoy a cordial \nrelationship. The Government\u2019s evidence pertaining to Malta does not provide a basis to \nbe concerned with Malta as a Government hostile to the U.S. Applicant is heavily vested \nin the U.S., financially and emotionally. His loyalty lies clearly with the U.S. \n \n\u201cWhole Person\u201d Analysis \n \n \nIn addition to the enumerated disqualifying and mitigating conditions as \ndiscussed previously, I have considered the general adjudicative guidelines related to \nthe whole person concept under Directive \u00b6 E2.2.1. \u201cUnder the whole person concept, \nthe Administrative Judge must not consider and weigh incidents in an applicant\u2019s life \nseparately, in a piecemeal manner. Rather, the Judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s \nsecurity eligibility by considering the totality of an applicant\u2019s conduct and \ncircumstances.\u201d4 The directive lists nine adjudicative process factors (APF) which are \nused for \u201cwhole person\u201d analysis.  Because foreign influence does not involve \nmisconduct, voluntariness of participation, rehabilitation and behavior changes, etc., the \neighth APF, \u201cthe potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress,\u201d Directive \u00b6 \nE2.2.1.8, is the most relevant of the nine APFs to this adjudication.5 In addition to the \neighth APF, other \u201c[a]vailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, \nfavorable and unfavorable, should be considered in reaching a determination.\u201d  \nDirective \u00b6 E2.2.1.  Ultimately, the clearance decision is \u201can overall common sense \ndetermination.\u201d  Directive \u00b6 E2.2.3.     \n \n \nThe Appeal Board requires the whole person analysis address \u201cevidence of an \napplicant\u2019s personal loyalties; the nature and extent of an applicant\u2019s family\u2019s ties to the \nU.S. relative to his [or her] ties to a foreign country; his or her ties social ties within the \n \n4 ISCR Case No. 03-04147 at 3 (App. Bd.

Jan. 5, 2007) (rejecting contention that \neighth APF is exclusive circumstance in whole person analysis in foreign influence cases). \n\n \n12 \n \n \nU.S.; and many others raised by the facts of a given case.\u201d ISCR Case No. 04-00540 at \n7 (App. Bd. Jan. 5, 2007). \n \n \nI have carefully considered Applicant\u2019s family connections and personal \nconnections to Malta. He lived in Malta during his formative years, moved to Canada \nwhen he was 23 years old, and approximately one year later moved to the U.S. He was \neducated in Malta until the 6th grade, and after he finished school, he worked on the \nfamily farm. His mother and sister, and brother-in-law are citizens and residents of \nMalta. He has frequent, non-casual contact with his mother and sister and her family in \nMalta. Applicant traveled to visit his family seven times since 1999.  He held a Malta \npassport.   \n   \nSubstantial mitigating evidence weighs towards grant of Applicant\u2019s security \nclearance. Applicant has lived in the United States for the past 36 years, and he has \nbeen a naturalized citizen over 23 years. The only passport he has used since \nbecoming a U.S. citizen is his U.S. passport. His use of his Malta passport was limited \nto domestic travel within Malta to obtain a discounted helicopter ride. When he became \naware that possession of a foreign passport was a concern, he surrendered his Malta \npassport to his Facility Security Manager.  \n \nHe has strong ties to the U.S. His two U.S.-born children live in the U.S. as well \nas two of his siblings and their families. Applicant, without hesitation, expressed a \nwillingness to renounce his Malta citizenship knowing that it would in all likelihood \npreclude him from his family inheritance in Malta.  Applicant stated his position \nsuccinctly, \u201cI like it here (referring to the U.S.) My special connection is here.\u201d His \nmother in Malta is elderly and lives off of her U.S. social security. None of his immediate \nfamily members overseas are in positions placing them as likely targets as a means to \nexploit Applicant. He has limited financial ties overseas in contrast to his significant U.S. \nfinancial ties. There is no evidence he has ever taken any action which could cause \npotential harm to the United States.  Particularly noteworthy is the fact he has \nsuccessfully held a security clearance over 13 years and has held a courier certificate \nwhich authorizes him to transport classified information. \n \nApplicant\u2019s employer\u2019s confidence and trust in him is so high as to warrant \nrecommending him for a clearance. This was clearly demonstrated by his company \nFacility Security Manager testifying on his behalf. Applicant takes his loyalty to the \nUnited States very seriously, and he has worked diligently for his employer for 36 years. \nHis work performance evaluations provide a resounding assessment that characterizes \nhim as loyal, trustworthy, conscientious, responsible, mature, and of high integrity. In \nshort, he has an excellent, well-deserved reputation as a loyal, trustworthy, U.S. citizen. \nHis witness and documentary evidence recommend and support grant of a security \nclearance. Although the Government does not have an evidentiary burden, it is \nnoteworthy that the Government did not produce any derogatory information about him \nnor did anyone come forward recommending denial of his security clearance. \n \n\n \n13 \n \n \n                                                          \nAlthough the Government has no obligation to present evidence that Applicant \nand/or his family members are foreign agents, Applicant\u2019s family members are not, and \nnever have been, foreign agents. Malta is a developed, stable, democratic nation with a \nmodern economy. Malta has very favorable relations with the U.S.  \n \nThis case must be adjudged on his own merits, taking into consideration all \nrelevant circumstances, and applying sound judgment, mature thinking, and careful \nanalysis. This Analysis must answer the question whether there is a legitimate concern \nunder the facts presented that the Malta Government or its agents might exploit or \nattempt to exploit Applicant\u2019s immediate family members in such a way that this U.S. \ncitizen would have to choose between his pledged loyalty to the U.S. and those family \nmembers. I conclude that no legitimate concern of this nature exists. \n \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, all the facts and \ncircumstances, in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has mitigated \nthe security concerns pertaining to foreign influence and preference.   \n \nI take this position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518 (1988), my \u201ccareful consideration of the whole person factors\u201d6 and \nsupporting evidence, my application of the pertinent factors under the Adjudicative \nProcess, and my interpretation of my responsibilities under the Guidelines. Applicant \nhas mitigated or overcome the government\u2019s case. For the reasons stated, I conclude \nhe is eligible for access to classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:  \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline C:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a. \u2013 d.: \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline B:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a. \u2013 2.e.:  \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n6See ISCR Case No. 04-06242 at 2 (App. Bd.

On April 13, 2007,\n1\nthe Defense Office of Hearing and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing\nthe basis for its decision to deny a security clearance for Applicant.   The action was taken under\n2\nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1990),\nas amended, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), using the new Adjudicative\nGuidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and implemented by the\nDepartment of Defense on September 1, 2006.  Applicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on April\n20, 2007.   The SOR alleges security concerns under Guideline J (Criminal Conduct), Guideline G\n3\n(Alcohol Consumption), and Guideline E (Personal Conduct) of the Directive.\nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on April 23, 2007.  He admitted all allegations in the\nSOR, with an explanation of his response to a question on his security clearance application which\nraised the allegation under Guideline E.   He elected to have the matter decided on the written record\n4\nin lieu of a hearing.\nDepartment Counsel submitted the Government\u2019s written case on June 21, 2007.  Applicant\nreceived a complete file of relevant material (FORM) on June 28, 2007, and was provided the\nopportunity to file objections and submit material to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the disqualifying\nconditions.  He timely provided additional information, and Department Counsel stated no objection\nto consideration of the material on July 31, 2007.  The case was assigned to me on August 13, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant is 26 years old and is employed by a defense contractor.

However, he states his\nexcess alcohol consumption is in the past and he has \u201cmoved on\u201d.  He no longer drinks alcohol to\nexcess.  He did see a doctor in 2004 who opined that Applicant did not need classes or treatment for\ndrinking alcohol.  He has learned from his mistakes.  He is in a new chapter of his life and has a\nhealthier environment.  He surrounds himself with others who share his same goals.  He has no plans\nfor alcohol in his future.  He learned first hand the negative effects of alcohol and how it can affect\nyou and destroy your life.\nIn completing his security clearance application, Applicant answered \u201cno\u201d to question 23(d)\nasking if he had \u201cever been charged with or convicted of any offense(s) related to alcohol or drugs?\u201d\nApplicant did not list his November 2005 arrest for driving under the influence.

Oct. 7,\n17\n1993))\n4\nDirective.9\nThe adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make\nan affirmative determination that the person is eligible for a security clearance.  An administrative\njudge must apply the \u201cwhole person concept,\u201d and consider and carefully weigh the available, reliable\ninformation about the person.   An administrative judge should consider: (1) the nature, extent, and\n10\nseriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the applicant\u2019s age and maturity at the\ntime of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation\nand other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for\npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation of recurrence.11\nA person granted access to classified information enters into a special relationship with the\ngovernment.  The government must be able to repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those\nindividuals to whom it grants access to classified information.  The decision to deny an individual a\nsecurity clearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant.   It is merely\n12\nan indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of\nDefense have established for issuing a clearance.\nInitially, the Government must present evidence to establish controverted facts in the SOR that\ndisqualify or may disqualify the Applicant from being eligible for access to classified information.13\nThereafter, Applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate\nfacts.   An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the\n14\nnational interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d   The government is under no duty to\n15\npresent evidence to disprove any Adjudicative Guideline mitigating condition, and an administrative\njudge cannot assume or infer that any particular mitigating condition is applicable merely because the\ngovernment does not present evidence to disprove that particular mitigating condition.   \u201c[T]he\n16\nDirective presumes there is a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the\ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability.\u201d   \u201cAny doubt as to whether access to\n17\nclassified information is clearly consistent with national security will be resolved in favor of the\n\nEgan, 484 U.S. at 531; see Directive \u00b6 E2.2.2.\n18\nAG \u00b6 21.\n19\nAG \u00b6 15.\n20\nAG \u00b6 30.\n21\n5\nnational security.\u201d 18\nBased upon a consideration of the evidence, I find the following adjudicative guidelines most\npertinent to the evaluation of the facts in this case:\nGuideline G - Alcohol Consumption: Excessive alcohol consumption often leads to the\nexercise of questionable judgment, or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about an\nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness.19\nGuideline E - Personal Conduct: Conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor,\ndishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions about an\nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information.  Of special interest\nis any failure to provide truthful and candid answers during the security clearance process or any other\nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.20\nGuideline J - Criminal Conduct: Criminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment,\nreliability, and trustworthiness.  By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability or\nwillingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations.  \n21\nConditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying, as well as those which\nwould mitigate security concerns, pertaining to the adjudicative guidelines are set forth and discussed\nin the conclusions section below.\nCONCLUSIONS\nI carefully considered all of the factors in evidence and the legal standards discussed above.\nI reach the following conclusions regarding the allegations in the SOR.\nApplicant\u2019s failure to list his November 2005 arrest for driving while intoxicated in response\nto question 23(d) on his security clearance application raises Personal Conduct Disqualifying\nCondition (PC DC) \u00b6 16(a) (the deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant and\nmaterial facts from the personal security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used\nto conduct investigations . . . determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness).  Personal\nconduct is always a security concern because it asks the central question does the person\u2019s past conduct\njustify confidence the person can be trusted to properly safeguard classified information.  The security\nclearance system depends on an individual providing correct and accurate information.  If a person\nconceals or provides false information, the security clearance process cannot function properly to\nensure that granting access to classified information is in the best interest of the United States\nGovernment.  A deliberate omission or false statement on a security clearance application is a criminal\n\n10 U.S. C. \u00a7 1001.\n22\n6\noffense under federal law.22\nApplicant\u2019s explanation that he misread the question not realizing it pertained to arrests as well\nas convictions is without merit.  The question is clear and unambiguous that it applies to both arrests\nand convictions.  Applicant has some college education so he should have college level reading\ncomprehension.  Applicant also noted that at the time he completed the application he had not been\nsentenced for the offense and thought it may be dismissed.  It is clear he minimally understood that\na charge was pending and therefore he was required to report it.  This thought is another indications\nhe understood the question and deliberately did not provide a correct response.  His false answer to\nthe question was deliberate and misleading, and I find Applicant intentionally failed to provide correct\ninformation in response to question 23(d) on the security clearance application.\nI have considered Personal Conduct Mitigating Conditions (PC MC) \u00b6 17(a) (the individual\nmade prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, concealment, or falsification before being\nconfronted with the facts); and PC MC \u00b6 17(c) (the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed,\nor the behavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is unlikely to\nrecur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment).  While\nApplicant mentioned his failure to list the offense to the security agent, he did it in response to\nquestions raised by the agent but not before he was confronted with a potential omission error.  Also,\na deliberate failure to include a criminal offense on a security application is not a minor offense, it\nhappened only 16 months prior so a lot of time has not passed, there were no unique circumstances\nconcerning his completion of the application, and there is no indication it will not happen again.  I find\nagainst Appellant as to Personal Conduct.\nApplicant\u2019s convictions for driving while intoxicated, drunk in public and disorderly conduct,\npossession of alcohol as a minor, and a false statement on a security clearance application raises\nCriminal Conduct Disqualifying Condition (CC DC) \u00b6 31(a) (a single serious crime or multiple lesser\noffenses), and CC DC \u00b6 31(c) (allegations or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the\nperson was formally charged, formally prosecuted or convicted).  In this case, there are three alcohol-\nrelated offenses and a criminal offense for deliberately not providing required information on a security\nclearance application.  These acts raise criminal conduct security concerns.  \nI have considered the Criminal Conduct Mitigating Conditions (CC MC), and only CC MC \u00b6\n32(a) (so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, it happened under such unusual\ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability,\ntrustworthiness, or good judgment); and CC MC \u00b6 31(d) (there is evidence of successful rehabilitation,\nincluding but not limited to the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or\nrestitution, job training or higher education, good employment record, or constructive community\ninvolvement) may have some applicability.  Applicant engaged in alcohol-related criminal conduct in\n2002, 2004, and 2005.  He deliberately failed to provide correct information on his security clearance\napplication in 2006.  These events all happened within four years, the last less one than two years ago.\nThe events are based on Applicant\u2019s voluntary action and there is no information to suggest the events\nhappened under unusual circumstances.  Applicant presented no evidence of attendance at any\ncounseling or rehabilitation programs for his use of alcohol.  Applicant presented limited information\n\n7\non any rehabilitation.  With insufficient time elapsed since his last criminal act and limited evidence\nof successful rehabilitation, Applicant has not met his burden of establishing that he is rehabilitated\nand his past criminal actions do not indicate a security concern.  I find against Applicant for criminal\nconduct.\nSecurity concerns for alcohol consumption are based on Applicant\u2019s driving while intoxicated\narrest, disorderly conduct and drunk in public offense, minor in possession of alcohol offense, and\nApplicant\u2019s admitted excess drinking of alcohol to the point of intoxication from 1999 to November\n2005.  Applicant\u2019s admission to these alcohol-related incidents raises Alcohol Consumption\nDisqualifying Conditions (AC DC) \u00b6 22(a) (alcohol-related incidents away from home, such as driving\nwhile under the influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other incidents of\nconcern, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent).\nDriving while intoxicated is one of the examples used for an alcohol-related incident away from work.\nHis arrest for drunk in public and disorderly conduct is similar in kind to disturbing the peace.  He was\narrested and/or convicted of three alcohol-related offenses in three years, thereby establishing (AD DC)\n\u00b6 22(a).\nThe government has established and Applicant admitted a security concern based on the\nalcohol-related offenses and excess consumption of alcohol to the point of intoxication.  Applicant has\nthe heavy burden of establishing facts and information to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the security\nconcern.  Applicant raised, in his responses to the SOR and FORM, Alcohol Consumption Mitigating\nConditions (AC MC) \u00b6 23(a) (so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it\nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on the\nindividual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment, and AC MC \u00b6 23(b) (the individual\nacknowledges his or her alcoholism or issues of alcohol abuse, provides evidence of actions taken to\novercome this problem, and has established a pattern of abstinence (if alcohol dependent) or\nresponsible use (if an alcohol abuser).  There were three alcohol-related incidents in almost a three year\nperiod.  Applicant admitted he drank alcohol to excess and the point of intoxication at times for seven\nyears.  The behavior was frequent and voluntary.  Applicant acknowledged he had an alcohol problem.\nHis rehabilitation information consists merely of his statement that he no longer drinks alcohol, nor\nassociates with friends who do, and lives a healthier life style.  While he stated a doctor informed him\nthat he did not need to attend alcohol abuse classes or programs, he presented no substantiating\ndocuments to verify his medical consultation.  Applicant\u2019s statement alone is not sufficient to conclude\nthere was an evaluation that he does not require further rehabilitative programs.  He presents no other\ninformation of rehabilitation activities like counseling, or meeting attendance to overcome his alcohol\nproblem or other corroboration to his claims.  He has not presented sufficient information that his\nalcohol consumption is no longer a security concern.\nI have considered Applicant\u2019s conduct under the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept.  I find he is not\neligible for access to classified information.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required\nby Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive are;\n\n8\nParagraph 1, Guideline J:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a.:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b.:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c.:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d.:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline G:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a.:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b.:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 3, Guideline E:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 3.a.:\nAgainst Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all of the circumstances in the record in this case, it is not clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On March 20, 2007, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of\nthe basis for that decision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations)\n\nThe Judge found in favor of Applicant under Guideline F.  That favorable finding is not at issue on appeal.\n1\nDecision at 3.\n2\n2\nand Guideline E (Personal Conduct) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as\namended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.  On August 27, 2007, after the hearing,\nAdministrative Judge Juan J. Rivera denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant\ntimely appealed pursuant to the Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.1\nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge erred in concluding\nApplicant\u2019s falsification of his security clearance application was deliberate;  whether the Judge was\nunfair, or arbitrary and capricious.  Finding no error, we affirm.\n(1) Applicant argues that he did not deliberately falsify his response to two questions on his\nsecurity clearance application by failing to disclose three debts totaling approximately $36,000 that\nhad been delinquent for more than 90 or 180 days.  Applicant\u2019s argument in this regard does not\ndemonstrate that the Judge erred.\nIn this case, Applicant had initially offered multiple explanations for his failure to disclose\nthe delinquent debts, including not having enough time to review his answers, having problems with\nthe on-line account used to submit his security clearance application, and working in a high pressure\nposition.  At the end of cross-examination, he had admitted that he had not disclosed the information\nin question because he was embarrassed about his financial problems.   The Judge reasonably\n2\nconsidered Applicant\u2019s explanations in light of the record evidence as a whole, and concluded there\nwas a sufficient basis to find that Applicant\u2019s omissions were deliberate and intentional.  On this\nrecord, the Judge\u2019s finding of deliberate falsification is sustainable.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1.\n \n(2) Applicant also contends that the Judge was unfair, essentially based upon the fact that the\nJudge did not find Applicant\u2019s favorable evidence sufficient to mitigate the government\u2019s security\nconcerns.  In support of this contention, he argues that he has been granted a clearance on two prior\noccasions without incident, and that he has received numerous awards for excellent service from\nboth the Navy and the Coast Guard.  The Board does not find this argument persuasive.\nThere is a rebuttable presumption that a Judge is impartial and unbiased, and a party seeking\nto rebut that presumption has a heavy burden of persuasion.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 02-08032 at\n4 (App. Bd. May 14, 2004).  The issue is not whether Applicant personally believes the Judge was\nunfair, but whether the record contains any indication the Judge acted in a manner that would lead\na reasonable person to question his fairness.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-09462 at 2 (App. Bd. Jul.\n19, 2007).  Lack of partiality is not demonstrated merely because the Judge made adverse findings\nor reached unfavorable conclusions.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-09462 at 2 (App. Bd. Jul. 19,\n2007).  Moreover, even if an appealing party demonstrates error by the Judge, proof of such error,\nstanding alone, does not demonstrate the Judge was biased or prejudice.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No.\n04-03834 at 2 (App. Bd. Jul. 2, 2007).  Applicant has not met this heavy burden of persuasion, in\nthat he fails to identify anything in the record below that indicates or suggests a basis for a reasonable\nperson to question the fairness, impartiality, or professionalism of the Judge.  See, e.g., ISCR Case\n\n3\nNo. 03-00740 at 2 (App. Bd. Jun. 6, 2006).\nThe Board has previously noted that there is no right to a security clearance, nor is there a\npresumption in favor of granting or continuing a security clearance.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 02-\n00318 at 8 (App. Bd. Feb. 25, 2004); ISCR Case No. 03-08073 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 25, 2005).  Prior\nsecurity clearance adjudications and the granting of clearances for the Applicant have no bearing on\nthe legal sufficiency of the Judge\u2019s adverse clearance decision here.  See, e.g, ISCR Case No. 03-\n04927 at 5 (App. Bd. Mar. 4, 2005).  The government is not estopped from making an adverse\nclearance decision when there were prior favorable adjudications.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 01-\n24506 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 11, 2003).  In that regard, the government has the right to reconsider the\nsecurity significance of past conduct or circumstances in light of more recent conduct or\ncircumstances having negative security significance.  See, e.g., DISCR Case No. 91-0775 at 3 (App.\nBd. Aug. 25, 1992); ISCR Case No. 02-17609 at 3-4 (App. Bd. May 19, 2004).\nLikewise, the absence of prior security violations does not bar or preclude an adverse security\nclearance decision.  The federal government need not wait until an applicant actually mishandles\nclassified information before it can deny or revoke access to such information.  See ISCR Case No.\n05-07747 at 2 (App. Bd. Jul. 3, 2007) citing Adams v. Laird, 420 F. 2d 230, 238-239 (D.C. Cir.\n1969), cert. denied, 397 U.S. 1039 (1970). An applicant with good or exemplary job performance\nmay engage in conduct that has negative security implications.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 99-0123\nat 3 (App. Bd. Jan. 11, 2000).  The Directive's Guidelines set forth a variety of examples of off-duty\nconduct and circumstances which are of security concern to the government and mandate a whole-\nperson analysis to determine an applicant's security eligibility.  A whole-person analysis is not\nconfined to the workplace.  See ISCR Case No. 03-11231 at 3 (App. Bd. Jun. 4, 2004). \nOnce the government presents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the\napplicant to establish mitigation.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  The application of disqualifying and\nmitigating conditions does not turn simply on a finding that one or more of them apply to the\nparticular facts of a case.  Rather, their application requires the exercise of sound discretion in light\nof the record evidence as a whole.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 01-14740 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan.15, 2003).\nThus, the presence of some mitigating evidence does not alone compel the Judge to make a favorable\nsecurity clearance decision.  As the trier of fact, the Judge has to weigh the evidence as a whole and\ndecide whether the favorable evidence outweighs the unfavorable evidence, or vice versa.  An\napplicant\u2019s disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, or an ability to argue for a\ndifferent interpretation of the evidence, is not sufficient to demonstrate that the Judge weighed the\nevidence or reached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.\nThe Applicant has not met his burden of demonstrating that the Judge erred in concluding\nthat the security concerns raised by Applicant\u2019s falsifications had not been mitigated.  Although\nApplicant strongly disagrees with the Judge\u2019s conclusions, he has not established that those\nconclusions are arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.3.\nIn this case, the Judge weighed the mitigating evidence offered by Applicant against the\nrecency and seriousness of the disqualifying conduct, and considered the possible application of\nrelevant mitigating conditions and whole-person factors.  He found in favor of the Applicant with\nrespect to the Guideline F allegations.  However, he reasonably explained why the evidence which\nthe Applicant had presented in mitigation was insufficient to overcome the government\u2019s security\n\n4\nconcerns under Guideline E.  The Board does not review a case de novo.  The favorable  evidence\ncited by Applicant is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge\u2019s decision is arbitrary, capricious, or\ncontrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 02-28041 at 4 (App. Bd. Jun. 29, 2005).   Given the record\nthat was before him, the Judge\u2019s ultimate unfavorable clearance decision under Guideline E is\nsustainable.\nOrder\nThe decision of the Judge denying Applicant a security clearance is AFFIRMED.\nSigned: Michael Y.

Applicant requested a hearing.  On November 19,\n2007, after the hearing, Administrative Judge Paul J. Mason denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security\nclearance.  Applicant timely appealed pursuant to the Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raises the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s decision is arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.\nApplicant was convicted of driving under the influence of alcohol (DUI) twice\u2013in 1990 and\nin 2005.  After the second conviction, Applicant was required to attend an alcohol counseling\nprogram and a certain number of Alcoholics Anonymous meetings.  Applicant successfully\ncompleted those requirements.  The government also alleged falsification because Applicant listed\nonly the first DUI conviction on his Security Clearance Application (SCA), dated November 17,\n2005.  Applicant explained that he filled out the SCA in 2004, before the second arrest, but his\nemployer did not submit the SCA until November 2005. \nWith regard to Guideline G, the Judge made findings based on Applicant\u2019s testimony\nregarding his current consumption of alcohol.  Applicant testified that he has reduced his alcohol\nconsumption, but did not specify the amount of the reduction.  Applicant testified that the last time\nhe was legally intoxicated was two weeks before the hearing; at another point in his testimony, he\nsaid he had last been drunk within six months of the hearing.  Prior to reducing his alcohol\nconsumption, Applicant drank a six-pack of beer on Friday night and perhaps another six-pack on\nSaturday night.  He testified that after reducing his consumption, he had probably consumed a six-\npack of beer in one sitting within six months of the hearing.          \nOnce the government presented evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifted to\nApplicant to establish mitigation.   Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  The Judge concluded that Applicant had\n1\nnot met that burden.  In his appeal, Applicant disputes the weight the Judge gave to portions of the\nrecord evidence.  As the trier of fact, the Judge has to weigh the evidence as a whole and decide\nwhether the favorable evidence outweighs the unfavorable evidence, or vice versa.  See, e.g., ISCR\nCase No. 06-23112 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 31, 2007).  An applicant\u2019s disagreement with the Judge\u2019s\nweighing of the evidence, or an ability to argue for a different interpretation of the evidence, is not\nsufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious,\nor contrary to law.         \nIn this case, the Judge discussed the relevant disqualifying and mitigating conditions under\nGuideline G.  Looking at both the favorable and unfavorable record evidence, the Judge reasonably\nexplained why Applicant\u2019s evidence of mitigation did not overcome the government\u2019s security\nconcerns.  The Board does not review a case de novo.  The favorable evidence cited by Applicant\nis not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge\u2019s decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See,\ne.g., ISCR Case No. 02-28041 at 4 (App. Bd. Jun. 29, 2005).  Given the record that was before him,\nthe Judge\u2019s ultimate unfavorable decision under Guideline G is sustainable.\n\n3\nOrder\nThe decision of the Judge denying Applicant a security clearance is AFFIRMED.  \nSigned: Jeffrey D.

Edmunds, Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\n\n2\nSYNOPSIS\nApplicant has a history of four admitted alcohol-related incidents between 1981 and 2004\nthat resulted in convictions, jail time, fines and reduction in pay.  A separate assault conviction in\n2003 was preceded by alcohol consumption sufficient to make this offense alcohol-related as well.\nWhile never diagnosed as alcohol dependent, he has recently admitted to being an alcoholic,\nfollowing years of self-denial.  His restorative efforts to date, while encouraging, are insufficient to\nenable safe predictive assessments about Applicant\u2019s ability to avoid recurrence in the foreseeable\nfuture.  Applicant fails to fully mitigate government security concerns about his alcohol-related\nincidents that reflect alcohol  abuse.  Clearance is denied.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn March 19, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to\nExecutive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2,\n1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, which detailed reasons why DOHA could\nnot make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant, and recommended referral\nto an administrative judge to determine whether clearance should be granted, continued, denied or\nrevoked.\nApplicant responded to the SOR on May 12, 2007, and requested a hearing.  The case was\nassigned to me on June 20, 2007, and was scheduled for hearing on July 26, 2007.  A hearing was\nheld on July 26, 2007, for the purpose of considering whether it would be clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant, continue, deny, or revoke Applicant\u2019s security clearance.  At the hearing,\nthe Government's case consisted of nine  exhibits; Applicant relied on two witnesses (including\nhimself) and four exhibits.  The transcript (R.T.) was received on August 3, 2007.\nPROCEDURAL ISSUES\nBefore the close of the hearing, Applicant requested leave to keep the record open to permit\nhim the opportunity to obtain a medical evaluation.  For good cause shown, Applicant was granted\n14 days to supplement the record.  The Government, in turn was allowed three days to respond.\nApplicant did not supplement the record.\nSUMMARY OF PLEADINGS\nUnder Guidelines J and G, Applicant is alleged to have been (a) arrested, charged, or cited\nwith four alcohol-related offenses between 1981 and July 2004: specifically, in January 1981 for\nDriving Under the Influence (DuI) and driving with an invalid driver\u2019s license, after which he was\nturned over to military police, cited under Article III, UCMJ for DuI and operating without valid\nlicense, and awarded reduced pay; in November 1989 for DuI, for which he was found guilty, fined,\nsentenced to one day in jail, and ordered to complete 12 hours of alcohol classes; in January 2002\nfor liquor in vehicle, for which he was found guilty and fined; and in July 2004 for DuI and DuI with\na blood alcohol count (BAC) of .08 per cent or more, for which he was found guilty of DuI,\n\n3\nsentenced to one day in jail, fined, and required to attend alcohol screening.  Under Guideline J only,\nhe was alleged to have been charged in November 2003 with aggravated assault of a law\nenforcement officer, to which he pled guilty and was fined Additionally.\nAdditionally, under Guideline G, Applicant is alleged to been hospitalized in 1981 for an\nalcohol overdose and on occasion to have consumed a beer while driving a motor vehicle.\nFor his response to the SOR, Applicant admitted each of the allegations.  He provided\nexplanations of the events and circumstances associated with the alleged conduct and claimed to be\nworking on his alcohol problem.  \nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant is a 46year-old electronic technician for a defense contractor who seeks retention\nof a security clearance he has held since 1985 (R.T., at 62).  The allegations covered in the SOR and\nadmitted to by Applicant are incorporated herein by reference and adopted as relevant and material\nfindings.  Additional findings follow.\nApplicant was introduced to alcohol in high school (R.T., at 62-63).  Following his\nenlistment in the Army in 1978 he increased his consumption of alcohol (R.T., at 64).  He generally\ndrank two to three times a week, and on the occasions he drank, his consumption varied from a 12-\npack or six-pack of beer at a time (R.T., at 64).   Occasionally, he consumed hard liquor.\n In January 1981, Applicant was pulled over by German police for making an improper turn.\nHe had consumed alcohol (estimated to be six bottles of beer) with several German friends and was\ntaking them home when he was stopped (R.T., at 66).  He was subsequently transferred to U.S. Army\nmilitary police and charged with DuI with drunk driving and operating a POV without a valid\nUSAREUR driver\u2019s license under the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ).  As a result of this\narrest, his pay was reduced (R.T., at 67).  \nApplicant continued to consume alcohol on a regular basis for the duration of his Army\nenlistment.  In the summer of 1981 while stationed overseas, he and his German girlfriend consumed\nthree to four large steins (24 to 30 ounce jugs) of beer during the course of a day while socializing\nwith several Army friends (see ex. 7).  While traveling as a passenger with his girlfriend, he\nencountered breathing difficulties and laid down on the sidewalk in some distress (R.T., at 68-70).\nFriends called for a German ambulance to assist him.  An ambulance was dispatched  to the scene.\nApplicant was subsequently taken by ambulance to a U.S. Army hospital for observation (R.T., at\n70-71).  Attending hospital medical personnel told him he had overdosed on alcohol (ex. 7).\nApplicant disagreed with this assessment and attributed his breathing problems to an asthma attack.\nHospital records are not available to corroborate Applicant\u2019s account.  \nFollowing his discharge from the Army in September 1982, Applicant continued to consume\nalcohol on a regular basis.  While in Alaska (between 1982 and 1984) he drank two beers almost\nevery day (R.T., at 72-73).   He increased his alcohol intake to daily drinking after his relocation to\nhis present place of residence in 1984.  He continued his practice of daily alcohol consumption\nbetween 1984 and 2002. During this period, he occasionally consumed alcohol at the frequency rate\n\n4\nof one to two beers a day (save for a two year period spanning between 1982 and 1984 when he was\nresiding outside of the Continental United States) while on his way to pick up his daughter from\nschool (R.T., at 72-73) \nWhile at a racetrack event in November 1989, Applicant consumed three to four glasses of\nwhiskey.  On his way home from the track, he was arrested by city police for DuI and was later found\nguilty of DuI (R.T., at 58-60).  The court fined him $413.00, sentenced him to one day in jail, and\nrequired him to attend 12 hours of alcohol classes.  By all accounts, Applicant completed these\nclasses.  \nApplicant continued his daily drinking after his 1989 DuI arrest, and in January 2002, he was\ncited for liquor in his vehicle.  He was found guilty of the offense and fined $54.25.  Since his 2002\ncitation, he has never kept a beer or alcohol container in his car (R.T., at 79).  He continued\nconsuming beer after his 2002 citation, however, and in November 2003 he became embroiled in a\ndomestic argument with his wife after consuming about three beers (R.T., at 85).  Police were called\nto his house and during an exchange with the police, Applicant slightly bumped one of the police\nofficers (R.T., at 53-55, 85-86).  Although he denies any intentional bumping of the officer, he later\nplead guilty to charges of aggravated assault of a law enforcement officer and was fined $100.00 for\nthe offense.  While Applicant was not cited for an alcohol-related incident, his acknowledged intake\nof  beer preceding the incident is enough to make this an alcohol-related incident.\nApplicant continued to consume beer on a daily basis following his 2003 arrest, and was\narrested in July 2004 for DuI and DuI with a BAC of .08 per cent or more.  He was found guilty of\nDuI and was sentenced to 10 days in jail (all but one day suspended), fined $1,000.00, required to\nattend alcohol screening and counseling (believed to be 12 hours), and had his driver\u2019s license\nsuspended for 30 days (R.T., at 81-82).  Applicant was never diagnosed by his counselors.  So, still\nbelieving he did not have an alcohol problem, he continued drinking on a daily basis between June\n2004 and June 2007 (R.T., at 82-83).  \nAt the urging of his spouse following his receipt of the SOR, Applicant quit drinking in June\n2007 and turned to Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) for help (R.T., at 83-84).  Although never\ndiagnosed (R.T., at 88-90), he considers himself an alcoholic (viz., not someone who is dependent,\nbut rather one who drinks too much) and has attended AA meetings weekly (R.T., at 83-84, 88-95).\nHe has earned his 24 hour and 30-day chips that recognize his sustained abstinence for the periods\ncovered (see exs. C and D; R.T., at 53).  He has a sponsor who he occasionally talks to but has\ndelayed his participation in AA\u2019s 12-step program until after the holding of this hearing (R.T., at 84).\nAfforded a post-hearing opportunity to seek an evaluation from a credentialed medical provider or\nsubstance abuse counselor, Applicant has failed to do so in any way that can be documented in this\nrecord.\nApplicant is highly regarded by his supervisors and colleagues.  A test officer and colleague\nwho has worked along side of Applicant  rates Applicant a class A radar operator and describes him\nas the best radar operator he has ever seen (R.T., at 27-30).  He credits Applicant with being an asset\nto the contractor\u2019s mission.  This colleague assures he has never heard of Applicant\u2019s being drunk\non or off the work site (R.T., at 28).  However, this same colleague was not aware of Applicant\u2019s\nprior DuIs until just recently (R.T., at 33).  Other colleagues who have known Applicant for many\nyears also characterize him as an excellent radar operator who has never exhibited signs of drinking\n\n5\non or off the job (see ex. A; R.T., at 36-43).  Applicant has received numerous letters of appreciation\nand awards that recognize his contributions to the Army\u2019s test programs (see ex. B).  \nPOLICIES\nThe revised Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified\nInformation (effective September 2006) list Guidelines to be considered by judges in the decision\nmaking process covering DOHA cases.  These Guidelines require the judge to consider all of the\nconditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying (Disqualifying Conditions),\nif any, and all of the Mitigating Conditions, if any, before deciding whether or not a security\nclearance should be granted, continued or denied.  The Guidelines do not require the judge to assess\nthese factors exclusively in arriving at a decision.  In addition to the relevant Adjudicative\nGuidelines, judges must take into account the pertinent considerations for assessing extenuation and\nmitigation set forth in E.2.2 of the Adjudicative Process of Enclosure 2 of the Directive, which are\nintended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and impartial common sense decision.\nViewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following adjudication policy factors\nare pertinent herein:\nCriminal Conduct\nThe Concern: Criminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and\ntrustworthiness.  By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply\nwith laws, rules and regulations.\nAlcohol Consumption\nThe Concern.  Excessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment,\nor the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability and\ntrustworthiness. \nBurden of Proof\nBy virtue of the precepts framed by the Directive, a decision to grant or continue an\napplicant's security clearance may be made only upon a threshold finding that to do so is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest.  Because the Directive requires Administrative Judges to make\na common sense appraisal of the evidence accumulated in the record, the ultimate determination of\nan applicant's eligibility for a security clearance depends, in large part, on the relevance and\nmateriality of that evidence.  As with all adversary proceedings, the Judge may draw only those\ninferences which have a reasonable and logical basis from the evidence of record.  Conversely, the\nJudge cannot draw factual inferences that are grounded on speculation or conjecture.\nThe Government's initial burden is twofold: (1) It must prove any controverted fact[s] alleged\nin the Statement of Reasons and (2) it must demonstrate that the facts proven have a material bearing\nto the applicant's eligibility to obtain or maintain a security clearance.  The required showing of\nmaterial bearing, however, does not require the Government to affirmatively demonstrate that the\n\n6\napplicant has actually mishandled or abused classified information before it can deny or revoke a\nsecurity clearance. Rather, consideration must take account of cognizable risks that an applicant may\ndeliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information.\nOnce the Government meets its initial burden of proof of establishing admitted or\ncontroverted facts, the burden of persuasion shifts to the applicant for the purpose of establishing his\nor her security worthiness through evidence of refutation, extenuation or mitigation of the\nGovernment's case.\nCONCLUSIONS\nApplicant is a highly regarded electronics technician for a defense contractor with a history\nof regular alcohol consumption over a 30-year period and  five alcohol-related incidents between\n1981 and 2004.  Applicant\u2019s history of alcohol-related incidents and self-diagnosis of alcoholism\nreflect both a recent pattern of alcohol abuse outside the work place and a potential dependency\nproblem that raise security concerns.   \nOn the strength of the evidence presented, several disqualifying conditions (DC) of the\nAdjudication Guidelines for alcohol consumption may be applied: 22(a) (alcohol-related incidents\naway from work, such as driving while under the influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse,\ndisturbing the peace or other incidents of concern, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed\nas an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent) and 22\u00a9) (habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to\nthe point of impaired judgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol\nabuser or alcohol dependent).  Because Applicant\u2019s drinking has never been diagnosed, it is not\nentirely evident that his years of daily drinking can be considered habitual much less binge drinking\nwithin the meaning of DC 22\u00a9).  Nonetheless, the combination of his years of daily drinking when\nconsidered in juxtaposition to his DuI incidents and recent self-diagnosis of alcoholism justifies\nassigning some application to DC 22\u00a9) of the guidelines for alcohol consumption.\nBecause four of Applicant\u2019s alcohol-related offenses are covered by arrests or charges that\ninvolve criminal conduct, they are covered by the guidelines for criminal conduct as well.\nSpecifically, DC 31(a) (a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses) applies.  Because\nApplicant\u2019s 2002 citation for liquor in the vehicle does not involve a likely criminal offense, this\nincident is not specifically covered by guideline for criminal conduct.\nTo his credit, Applicant has acknowledged alcoholism, has become involved with AA, has\nobtained a sponsor, and has earned chips for 24 hours and 30 days of sustained abstinence,\nrespectively.  However, his failure to seek an evaluation and enlist substance abuse counseling for\nany identified alcohol problem to date, his acknowledged alcoholism, and his failure to furnish a\nfavorable prognosis preclude application of  any of the mitigating conditions of the guidelines for\nalcohol and criminal conduct. Applicant\u2019s  renewed commitment to abstinence does reflect positive\nchanges in behavior supportive of sobriety, and for these efforts Applicant is to be commended.\nFavorable views of his progress from work colleagues who know him are also helpful in gauging the\nstrength of his commitment to sobriety. \nTaking into account both Appellant\u2019s history of alcohol abuse and his strong work record,\nhis mitigation efforts to date, while encouraging, reflect insufficient evaluative information and\n\n7\nevidence of sustained commitment to AA and its tenets of sobriety to conclude he is no longer at risk\nof recurrence.  Without a favorable prognosis, it would be imprudent to relax the time mitigation\nrequirements of any of the mitigating conditions of the alcohol and criminal conduct guidelines,\nwhich in Applicant\u2019s case work conjunctively with each other. \nConsidering the record as a whole, Applicant failed to make a convincing showing that he\nhas both the maturity and resource support at his disposal to avert any recurrent problems with\njudgment lapses related to alcohol to warrant safe predictions that he is no longer at risk of judgment\nimpairment associated with such conduct.  Unfavorable conclusions warrant with respect to all but\none the allegations covered by the alcohol and criminal conduct guidelines of the SOR. \nSubparagraph 1.c is favorably concluded. \nIn reaching my decision, I have considered the evidence as a whole, including each of the E\n2.2 factors enumerated in the Adjudicative Guidelines of the Directive.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nIn reviewing the allegations of the SOR and ensuing conclusions reached in the context of\nthe FINDINGS OF FACT, CONCLUSIONS, CONDITIONS, and the factors listed above, this\nAdministrative Judge makes the following FORMAL FINDINGS:\nGUIDELINE J (CRIMINAL CONDUCT):\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSub-para. 1.a:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSub-para. 1.b:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSub-para. 1.c:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSub-para. 1.d:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSub-para. 1.e:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nGUIDELINE G (ALCOHOL):\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSub-para. 2a:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSub-para. 2.b:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSub-para. 2.c:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s security clearance.

LEONARD\nAPPEARANCES\nFOR GOVERNMENT\nRita C. O\u2019Brien, Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nSYNOPSIS\nApplicant has a history of unresolved financial problems. He has done nothing to demonstrate\nthat he will resolve the financial problems in a satisfactory manner. Clearance is denied. \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\n\n Executive Order 10865, dated February 20, 1960, as amended, and DoD Directive 5220.6, dated January 2,\n1\n1992, as amended (Directive).\n See Memorandum from the Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence, dated August 30, 2006, Subject:\n2\nImplementation of Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information (December\n29, 2005). \n Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.7. \n3\n2\nThis is a security clearance case. Applicant contests the Defense Department\u2019s intent to deny\nor revoke his eligibility for a security clearance. Acting under the relevant Executive Order and DoD\nDirective,  the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a statement of reasons\n1\n(SOR) to Applicant on April 27, 2007. The SOR is equivalent to an administrative complaint and\nit details the factual basis for the action. The issues in this case fall under Guideline F for financial\nconsiderations based on delinquent debts.  \nIn addition to the Directive, this case is brought under the revised Adjudicative Guidelines\nfor Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information (Revised Guidelines) approved by\nthe President on December 29, 2005. The Revised Guidelines were then modified by the Defense\nDepartment, effective September 1, 2006. They supersede or replace the guidelines published in\nEnclosure 2 to the Directive. They apply to all adjudications and other determinations where an SOR\nhas been issued on September 1, 2006, or thereafter.  The Revised Guidelines apply here because\n2\nthe SOR is dated after the effective date.  \nApplicant replied to the SOR with an incomplete response dated May 12, 2007. Upon\nrequest, he submitted an undated second response received by DOHA on June 22, 2007. He elected\nto have his case decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing.\nOn July 16, 2007, the government submitted its written case consisting of all relevant and\nmaterial information that could be adduced at a hearing. This so-called file of relevant material\n(FORM) was mailed to Applicant and it was received by him on July 25, 2007. Applicant did not\nreply within the 30-day period after receipt of the FORM.  The case was assigned to me on\n3\nSeptember 26, 2007.   \nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant is a 54-year-old mobile-equipment operator for a company engaged in defense\ncontracting. He has worked for his current employer since 1977. In addition to this employment, he\nhas worked a part-time job as a cleaner for a real estate firm since 1998.  \nApplicant has been married to the same woman since 1977.

Dec. 19, 2002) (citations omitted).\n13\n3\nApplicant claims that the $1,509 charged-off account was paid in April 1999 (Exhibit 7). He\nsubmitted paperwork to support his claim, but this paperwork appears to be for another debt and is\nnot connected to the $1,509 charged-off account. \nGENERAL PRINCIPLES OF LAW AND POLICIES\nNo one has a right to a security clearance.  As noted by the Supreme Court in Department\n4\nof Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe clearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations\nshould err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d  A favorable decision establishes eligibility of an\n5\napplicant to be granted a security clearance for access to confidential, secret, or top-secret\ninformation.  An unfavorable decision: (1) denies any application; (2)  revokes any existing security\n6\nclearance; and (3) prevents access to classified information at any level and retention of any existing\nsecurity clearance.  Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive, any doubt about whether\n7\nan applicant should be allowed access to classified information will be resolved in favor of\nprotecting national security.\nThere is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for access\nto classified information.  The government has the burden of presenting evidence to establish facts\n8\nalleged in the SOR that have been controverted.  An applicant is responsible for presenting evidence\n9\nto refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts that have been admitted or proven.  In addition, an\n10\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.  In Egan,\n11\nthe Supreme Court said that the burden of proof is less than the preponderance of the evidence.  The\n12\nagency appellate authority has followed the Court\u2019s reasoning, and a judge\u2019s findings of fact are\nreviewed under the substantial-evidence standard.13\nThe Revised Guidelines set forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when evaluating a\nperson\u2019s security clearance eligibility, including disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating\n\n Executive Order 10865, \u00a7 7.\n14\n Revised Guidelines at 13\u201314 (setting forth the disqualifying and mitigating conditions). \n15\n Revised Guidelines at 13. \n16\n DC 1 is \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts.\u201d \n17\n DC 3 is \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d \n18\n4\nconditions (MC) for each guideline. In addition, each clearance decision must be a fair and impartial\ncommonsense decision based upon consideration of all the relevant and material information, the\npertinent criteria and adjudication factors, and the whole-person concept. A person granted access\nto classified information enters into a special relationship with the government. The government\nmust be able to have a high degree of trust and confidence in those persons to whom it grants access\nto classified information. The decision to deny a person a security clearance is not a determination\nof an applicant\u2019s loyalty.  Instead, it is a determination that the applicant has not met the strict\n14\nguidelines the President has established for granting eligibility for a security clearance.\nCONCLUSIONS\nUnder Guideline F for financial considerations,  a security concern typically exists due to\n15\nsignificant unpaid debts. \u201cFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by\nrules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability,\ntrustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information.\u201d  Similarly, an individual who is\n16\nfinancially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, unconcerned, negligent, or careless in properly\nhandling and safeguarding classified information.   \nThe record evidence supports a conclusion that Applicant has a history of financial problems.\nHis history of financial problems is a security concern because it indicates inability or unwillingness\nto satisfy debts  and a history of not meeting financial obligations  within the meaning of Guideline\n17\n18\nF. The record evidence is more than sufficient to establish these two disqualifying conditions. \nAll of the mitigating conditions under Guideline F have been considered and none apply in\nApplicant\u2019s favor. Applicant did not respond to the FORM, and other than his limited response to\ninterrogatories, he did not provide sufficient evidence to overcome the security concern raised by the\ngovernment\u2019s evidence. Indeed, what is missing here is: (1) a realistic approach for resolving his\ndelinquent debts; (2) documented actions taken in furtherance of that approach; and (3) a measurable\nimprovement to his situation. At this point, it is likely that his history of financial problems will\ncontinue. \nTo conclude, Applicant did not present sufficient evidence to explain, extenuate, or mitigate\nthe financial considerations security concern. He has a history of unresolved financial problems, and\nhe has done nothing to demonstrate that he will resolve the financial problems in a satisfactory\nmanner. Applicant did not meet his ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance\n\n5\ndecision. In reaching this conclusion, the whole-person concept was given due consideration and that\nanalysis does not support a favorable decision. \nFORMAL FINDINGS\nSOR \u00b6 1\u2013Guideline F:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraphs a\u2013n:\nAgainst Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant\nor continue eligibility for a security clearance for Applicant.

Applicant\nwas arrested or charged six times over a four-year period with various offenses, including: four times\nfor possession of marijuana, twice for underage possession of alcohol, and twice for DWI.  He\nadmitted using marijuana from 1997 to 2004, a seven year period.  He was a habitual user.  Even\nthough he went through rehabilitation, he continued to use marijuana and alcohol  He failed to\nmitigate the security concerns about criminal conduct.  The government did not establish its case\nabout personal conduct.  Clearance is denied.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\n\nGovernment Exhibit 1 (Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-QIP) (SF 86), dated April 27, 2006).\n1\nTr. at 14-15.\n2\nId.\n3\n2\nOn April 27, 2006, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations\nProcessing (e-QIP) (SF 86).   The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to\n1\ngrant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.  As required by Executive Order 10865,\nSafeguarding Classified Information Within Industry, dated February 20, 1960, as amended, and\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended, DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons\n(SOR) on June 27, 2007, detailing the basis for its decision \u2013 security concerns raised under\nGuideline E (Personal Conduct) and Guideline J (Criminal Conduct) of the Directive.  The President\nissued revised adjudicative guidelines (Guidelines) on December 30, 2005.  DoD implemented them\non September 1, 2006.  Pending official amendment/reissue of DoD Directive 5220.6, the Guidelines\nare to be used in all cases when the SOR is dated on or after September 1, 2006.  Because the SOR\nwas issued after September 1, 2006, DoD policy requires that this case proceed under the revised\nguidelines. \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on July 16, 2007, and elected to have a hearing\nbefore an administrative judge.  DOHA assigned the case to me on August 15, 2007, and issued a\nNotice of Hearing on August 21, 2007.  I convened a hearing on September 19, 2007, to consider\nwhether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant's  security\nclearance.  The government offered nine exhibits, marked as Exhibits 1-9.  Applicant offered four\nexhibits, marked as Exhibits A-D.  All exhibits were admitted without objection.  DOHA received\nthe transcript (Tr.) on September 27, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant admitted the allegations contained in SOR paragraph 1 and denied the allegations\nin paragraph 2.

As a first-time\noffender, he was placed on unsupervised probation until December 22, 2000.4\nOn January 25, 2000, he was charged with underage possession of alcohol and possession\nof marijuana.  He was found guilty of minor in possession of alcohol, his driver\u2019s license was\nrestricted for six months, he was ordered to complete 50 hours of community service, attend the\nAlcohol Safety Action Program (ASAP), and ordered to pay $22 costs.  On the possession of\nmarijuana charge, he received a deferred disposition, paid court costs of $235, and the charge was\nsubsequently dismissed on May 17, 2001.5\nOn February 26, 2000, Applicant was arrested and charged with (1) possession of marijuana,\n(2) driving under the influence of drugs (marijuana), and (3) unlawful possession of alcohol.  On\ncounts (1) and (3), he received a deferred disposition, was ordered to attend the Alcohol Safety\nAction Program, and pay court costs of $179 for count (1) and $176 for count (3).  All three charges\nwere subsequently dismissed.   \n6\nApplicant successfully completed the ASAP program.   He also completed 50 hours of\n7\ncommunity service.8\nApplicant was arrested and charged with driving while intoxicated, first offense, on July 17,\n2001.

The stolen property was a stop sign that another roommate displayed on the townhouse\n11\nwall.12\nOn an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-QIP), executed by Applicant\non April 27, 2006, he was asked to disclose any illegal drug use in the last seven years or since age\n16 (Section 24).  He answered, \u201cYes\u201d, that he had used marijuana from August 1999 to September\n2003, and then he continued to use marijuana post rehabilitation on three occasions, from September\n2003 through February 2004.   He started using marijuana in high school, in 1997, and was a heavy\n13\nuser of marijuana while in college.  All of these incidents occurred while he was a college student.\nHe has not used marijuana since college (February 2004), and he stated his intent not to use\nmarijuana in the future.14\nApplicant successfully completed a drug rehabilitation program while in college.   He still\n15\nconsumes alcohol.   Character witnesses testified to his integrity, work ethic, honesty, and that they\n16\nhave not seen him use drugs since college days.17\nPOLICIES\nIn an evaluation of an applicant\u2019s security suitability, an administrative judge must consider\nthe \u201cAdjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility For Access to Classified Information\u201d\n(Guidelines).  In addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative\nguidelines are divided into Disqualifying Conditions (DC) and Mitigating Conditions (MC), which\nare used to determine an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible ironclad rules of law.  Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed\nin the adjudicative process.  An administrative judge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair,\n18\nimpartial and common sense decision.  Because the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a\nnumber of variables known as the \u201cwhole person concept,\u201d an administrative judge considers all\n\nGuideline \u00b6 2(c).\n19\nGuideline \u00b6 2(b).\n20\n\u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion\n21\nin light of all the contrary evidence in the record.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing\nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.32.1).  \u201cThis is something less than the weight of the evidence, and the possibility of drawing two\ninconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent [a Judge\u2019s] finding from being supported by substantial\nevidence.\u201d Consolo v. Federal Maritime Comm\u2019n, 383 U.S. 607, 620 (1966).  \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a\nscintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4  Cir. 1994).\nth\nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.15. \n22\nSee ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005) \u201cThe Administrative Judge considers the record evidence\n23\n.  \nas a whole, both favorable and unfavorable, evaluates Applicant\u2019s past and current circumstances in light of the\nprovisions of the Directive, and decide[s] whether Applicant has met his burden of persuasion under Directive \u00b6\nE3.1.15.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 04-10340 at 2 (App. Bd. July 6, 2006).\n5\navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.19\nSpecifically, an administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors\nlisted at Guideline \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency\nand recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5)\nextent to which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d\nSince the protection of the national security is the paramount consideration, the final decision\nin each case is arrived at by applying the standard that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being\nconsidered for access to classified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d   In\n20\nreaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based\non the evidence contained in the record.  Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on\nmere speculation or conjecture.\nIn the decision-making process, facts must be established by \u201csubstantial evidence.\u201d   The\n21\nGovernment initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish a case which demonstrates,\nin accordance with the Directive, that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant\nor continue an applicant\u2019s access to classified information.  Once the Government has produced\nsubstantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, the burden shifts to Applicant to present \u201cwitnesses\nand other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by\nDepartment Counsel, and [applicant] has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a\nfavorable clearance decision.\u201d   The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the\n22\nGovernment.23\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with\nthe Government predicated upon trust and confidence.  This relationship transcends normal duty\nhours and endures throughout off-duty hours.  The Government reposes a high degree of trust and\n\nExecutive Order 10865, \u00a7 7.\n24\n6\nconfidence in individuals to whom it grants access to classified information.  Decisions under this\nDirective include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk an applicant may deliberately or\ninadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified information.  Such decisions entail a certain\ndegree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nThe scope of an administrative judge\u2019s decision is limited.  Nothing in this Decision should\nbe construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole or in part, on any express or implied\ndetermination as to Applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or patriotism.24\nCONCLUSIONS\nPersonal Conduct\nGuideline \u00b6 15 of the new adjudicative guidelines sets out the security concerns covered by\nthe Personal Conduct guideline.  \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to\ncomply with rules and regulations can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability,\ntrustworthiness and ability to protect classified information.  Of special interest is any failure to\nprovide truthful and candid answers during the security clearance process or any other failure to\ncooperate with the security clearance process.\n \nUnder Guideline \u00b6 16 (c) a disqualifying condition may arise where there is \u201ccredible adverse\ninformation in several adjudicative issue areas that is not sufficient for an adverse determination\nunder any other single guideline . . . .\u201d  Also, paragraph 16(d) applies where there is \u201ccredible\nadverse information that is not explicitly covered under any other guideline and may not be sufficient\nby itself for an adverse determination. . . .\u201d  (Emphasis added.)\nIn this case, SOR the allegations in paragraphs 1 are the basis for the allegations under the\nguideline for Personal Conduct, which was the evidence of criminal activity, including use of\nmarijuana, minor in possession of alcohol, DWI, and possession of stolen goods.  However, each\nincident of criminal activity could support a basis for disqualification under Guideline J (Criminal\nConduct).  Thus, none of the evidence raises separate security concerns under the guideline for\npersonal conduct, unless Guideline \u00b6 16 (e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about\none's conduct, that \u201ccreates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress, such as (1)\nengaging in activities which, if known, may affect the person's personal, professional, or community\nstanding\u201d is applicable.  Applicant disclosed his criminal activity on his security clearance\napplication.  This shows Applicant is not vulnerable to exploitation.  \nThe government may allege Guideline \u00b6 16(g) association with persons involved in criminal\nactivity, referring to one of his roommates involved in the 2003 incident, supra.  However, there is\nno evidence that this individual has been involved in any criminal activity since the incident in 2003.\nTherefore, the government failed to establish a case under Guideline E.\n\n7\nCriminal Conduct\nGuidelines \u00b6 30. The Concern. Criminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment,\nreliability, and trustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person's ability or\nwillingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations.\nGuidelines \u00b6 31. Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying\ninclude:\n(a) a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses; and\n(c) allegation or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was formally\ncharged, formally prosecuted or convicted.\nApplicant admitted his criminal conduct, which mainly involved alcohol and/or drugs.  He\ndenied that this conduct was in violation of Guideline J (Criminal Conduct.).  Even if the charges\nwere dismissed after probation, they fall within Guidelines \u00b6 31(c).  The government established its\ncase.\nGuidelines \u00b632. Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include:\n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it happened under such\nunusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's\nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;\n(b) the person was pressured or coerced into committing the act and those pressures are no longer\npresent in the person's life;\n(c) evidence that the person did not commit the offense; and\n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited to the passage of time\nwithout recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or restitution, job training or higher education, good\nemployment record, or constructive community involvement.\nGuidelines \u00b632 (b) and (c) do not apply.  Applicant was not coerced into smoking marijuana,\nand he admitted his criminal activity.  \nApplicant was arrested or charged six times over a four-year period with various offenses,\nincluding: four times for possession of marijuana, twice for underage possession of alcohol, and\ntwice for DWI.  He admitted using marijuana from 1997 to 2004, a seven year period.  The use was\nfrequent and substantial during college.  He was a habitual user.  Even though he went through\nrehabilitation, he continued to use marijuana and alcohol.  The documents he placed into evidence\nconcerning his rehabilitation efforts are dated in 2000 and 2001.  He continued use until 2004.  He\nadmitted living with a drug dealer.  Applicant\u2019s conduct demonstrated blatant disregard of rules and\nregulations, by his use of illegal drugs, and he demonstrated a disregard for the court system.  After\nbeing placed on probation, as part of its first offense he was arrested one month subsequent and was\nplaced on probation, and arrested again one month after that.  Even living with a drug dealer shows\n\n8\npoor judgment.  The behavior was frequent and consistent, and his pattern of offenses were not\nminor,  when viewed in their totality.  It has only been three years since Applicant\u2019s last use of\nmarijuana, and that did not happen under unique circumstances.  He admitted remaining friends with\npeople from college, including his roommate who was a drug dealer.  He has made efforts to be\nrehabilitated, but those efforts failed in the past.  Successful rehabilitation is not limited to those\nfactors set out in Guidelines \u00b632 (d).  What is missing is evidence of satisfactory completion of a\nprescribed drug treatment program, including but not limited to rehabilitation and aftercare\nrequirements, such as participation in meetings of Narcotics Anonymous or a similar organization\nwithout recurrence of abuse, and a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified medical professional who\nis a staff member of a recognized drug treatment program.\nCharacter witnesses testified to his integrity, work ethic, honesty, and that they had not seen\nhim use drugs since college.\nWhole Person Analysis\nIn addition to the enumerated disqualifying and mitigating conditions, I have considered the\ngeneral adjudicative guidelines related to the whole person concept under Guidelines \u00b6 2(a).  I\nconsidered his age, his education, his employment, and what might motivate him to engage in\ncriminal activity.  Applicant\u2019s conduct was irresponsible.  I am concerned that lacking any\nsubstantial evidence of rehabilitation, Applicant has not been drug-free a sufficient period of time.\nHis continued association with a known drug dealer is problematic.  \nThe United States has a duty to protect itself from unauthorized disclosures of sensitive\ninformation and places the utmost trust in those persons to whom it grants access to sensitive\ninformation.  Applicant has demonstrated a lack of judgment and a casual attitude toward the law.\nHas he the sufficient maturity to protect classified information and to exercise the requisite good\njudgment and discretion expected of one in whom the government entrusts its interests?  The totality\nof the record raises reasonable and persistent doubts about Applicant's ability to protect classified\ninformation and to exercise that requisite good judgment.  I conclude that Applicant should not\ncontinue to have access to classified information.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required\nby E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1.

Howry, Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nSYNOPSIS\nApplicant\u2019s delinquent financial indebtedness was caused by circumstances beyond his\ncontrol, namely unemployment and underemployment over a nine year period, 1996 through 2005.\nSince gaining full time employment in November 2005, he has made a good faith effort to resolve\nhis indebtedness, as he is paying his debts in a systematic manner and has shown that he is now\nfinancially responsible.  Clearance is granted.\n\n2\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn April 20, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to\nExecutive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2,\n1992, (as amended) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant, which detailed reasons\nwhy DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant and\nrecommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether clearance should be denied\nor revoked.\nThe Applicant responded to the SOR in writing on May 15, 2007, and requested a hearing\nbefore DOHA Administrative Judge.  This case was assigned to the undersigned on June 29, 2007.\nA notice of hearing was issued on July 5, 2007, scheduling the hearing for July 25, 2007.  A hearing\nwas held on July 25, 2007, however, the matter was continued in order to allow the Applicant the\nopportunity to obtain additional documentary evidence that was necessary to proceed in this matter.\nA second hearing was held on September 25, 2007.  At the hearings the Government presented\neleven exhibits, referred to as Government Exhibits 1 through 11.  The Applicant presented twenty-\nfive exhibits, referred to as Applicant\u2019s Exhibits A through Y.  He also testified on his own behalf.\nThe official transcripts (Tr.) were received on August 3, 2007 and October 3, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nThe Applicant is 57 years old and married.  He has the equivalent to a Bachelor\u2019s Degree in\nMechanical Engineering.  He is employed by a defense contractor as an Engineer and is seeking to\nobtain a security clearance in connection with his employment.\nThe Government opposes the Applicant's request for a security clearance, on the basis of\nallegations set forth in the Statement of Reasons (SOR).  The following findings of fact are entered\nas to each paragraph and guideline in the SOR:\nParagraph 1 (Guideline F - Financial Considerations)  The Government alleges that the Applicant\nis ineligible for clearance because he is financially overextended and at risk to engage in illegal acts\nto generate funds. \nPrior to 1996, the Applicant was gainfully employed and met all of his financial obligations\nwithout difficulty.  Since NAFTA passed in 1994, he has suffered serious economic hardship.  From\nabout 1996 through 2005, he experienced several employment lay-offs, company closings, and spotty\nemployment due to the poor manufacturing economy.  Simply stated, for a nine year period, he was\nunable to find suitable employment.  Although he did consulting and contract engineering work, it\nwas sporadic and temporary.  During this period, he was unable to properly support his family and\nmeet his financial obligations.  Although he always filed his income tax returns on time and paid\nsome taxes, he failed to withhold enough money from his paycheck to cover the taxes and could not\nafford to pay them when they were due.  (See Applicant\u2019s Exhibits O, P, Q, R, and S).  As a result\n\n3\nof this unemployment and underemployment, the Applicant has experienced financial difficulties\nthat he is still trying to dig himself out of.  \nFinally, in November 2005, the Applicant was offered a full time permanent position with\na defense contractor.  In order to take this job, the Applicant had to move from a newly purchased\nhome in Illinois to California.  His family currently resides in Illinois, but plans to join him in\nCalifornia as soon as they are able to sell their home in Illinois.  (See Applicant\u2019s Exhibit L).  The\nApplicant plans to immediately pay off all of his debt from the profits from his home in Illinois.  (See\nGovernment Exhibit 6).  \nThe Applicant admits each of the debts listed in the SOR.  (See Applicant\u2019s Answer to SOR\nand Government Exhibits 5, 7 and 8).  A debt originally owed to Ameritech, that was taken over by\nHorizon, in the amount of $143.00 for a disconnect fee, the Applicant believes he does not owe.  The\nApplicant states that because he did not sign a contract with the creditor, he is not obligated to pay\nthe debt.  He realizes, however, that his credit reports reflect that he owes the debt.  At the time of\nthe hearing, the Applicant had discussed the issue with the creditor of several occasions, but had put\nnothing in writing.  Two letters prepared by the Applicant, both dated July 30, 2007, show that he\nrecently wrote to Equifax and Trans Union concerning this debt dispute.  (See Applicant\u2019s Exhibit\nU and V).  The Applicant received a response from Trans Union that the disputed debt does not\ncurrently appear on his Trans Union credit report.  (See Applicant\u2019s Exhibit W).  \n     \nThe Applicant owed delinquent federal taxes to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) in the\ntotal approximate amount of $16,300.95.  (See Tr. p. 17 and Applicant\u2019s Exhibit N).  This includes\na debt to the IRS in the amount of approximately $8,055.00, a debt to the IRS in the amount of\n$6,647.00, and a debt to the ISR in the amount of $4,098.00.  Three notice of federal tax liens were\nfiled against the Applicant, two in August 2003 and one in December 2006.  (See Government\nExhibits 1, 2 and 4).  Since February 2007, his wages are have been voluntarily garnished in order\nto pay these debts.  At this rate, he projects that he will pay off the debt by March 2008.  An e-mail\ncorrespondence dated July 30, 2007, from the Applicant\u2019s employer\u2019s central payroll services\nindicates that as of that date the Applicant had already paid $7,385.23 toward his debt to the IRS\nthrough voluntary garnishment.  (See Applicant\u2019s Exhibit N).  He is paying 25% of his disposable\nwages.  In addition, the Applicant\u2019s wife has paid $1,432.29 of this debt through garnishment.  (See\nApplicant\u2019s Exhibit B).  In total the Applicant believes that he has paid approximately $10,000.00\ntoward this debt.  (Tr. p.17).  The Applicant stated that although he always filed his income tax\nreturns and paid his taxes, he simply was not withholding enough, and could not afford to pay the\ntaxes because of his underemployment situation.  He was forced to use his savings and retirement\nmoney to live on.  Since November 2005, when he gained full time employment, he has been paying\nhis debts.\nA debt in the amount of $514.00 for delinquent medical bills is also being paid.  Applicant\nsubmitted a payment schedule that was approved by the creditor indicating that he is making\npayments of $75.00 monthly and will continue to do so until the debt is paid in full.  (See Applicant\u2019s\nExhibit D).      \n\n4\nFor the past year and a half, his most recent full time employment, the Applicant has received\npositive performance reviews from his employer.  (See Applicant\u2019s Exhibit K).  He is now paying\nhis debts and is also able to save some money.  (See Applicant\u2019s Exhibit F).       \nPOLICIES\nEnclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudication policies divided into \"Disqualifying\nFactors\" and \"Mitigating Factors.\"  The following Disqualifying Factors and Mitigating Factors are\nfound to be applicable in this case:\nGuideline F (Financial Considerations)\n18.  The Concern.  Failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial\nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and\nregulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and\nability to protect classified information.  An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of\nhaving to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nConditions that could raise a security concern:\n19.  (a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; \n19.  (c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nConditions that could mitigate security concerns:\n20.  (b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s\ncontrol (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death,\ndivorce or separation), and the individual has acted responsibly under the circumstances;\n20.  (c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are\nclear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control;\n20.  (d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise\nresolve debts.\nIn addition, as set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive at pages 16-17,  in evaluating the\nrelevance of an individual\u2019s conduct, the Administrative Judge should consider the following general\nfactors:\n a.  The nature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding circumstances\n\n5\nb.  The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation\nc.  The frequency and recency of the conduct\nd.  The individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct\ne.  The voluntariness of participation\nf.  The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavior changes\ng.  The motivation for the conduct \nh. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress\n \ni.  The likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nThe eligibility criteria established in the DoD Directive identify personal characteristics and\nconduct which are reasonably related to the ultimate question, posed in Section 2 of Executive Order\n10865, of whether it is \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d to grant an Applicant\u2019s request\nfor access to classified information.\nThe DoD Directive states, \u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period\nof a person\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the person is an acceptable security risk.\nEligibility for access to classified information is predicted upon the individual meeting these\npersonnel security guidelines.  The adjudicative process is the careful weighing of a number of\nvariables known as the whole person concept.  Available, reliable information about the person, past\nand present, favorable and unfavorable should be considered in reaching a determination.\u201d The\nAdministrative Judge can draw only those inferences or conclusions that have reasonable and logical\nbasis in the evidence of record.  The Judge cannot draw inferences or conclusions based on evidence\nwhich is speculative or conjectural in nature.  Finally, as emphasized by President Eisenhower in\nExecutive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under this order . . . shall be a determination in terms\nof the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the Applicant\nconcerned.\u201d\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn the defense industry, the security of classified industrial secrets is entrusted to civilian\nworkers who must be counted upon to safeguard such sensitive information twenty-four hours per\nday, seven days per week.  The Government is therefore appropriately concerned when available\ninformation indicates that an Applicant for clearance may be involved in instances of financial\nirresponsibility, which demonstrates poor judgment or unreliability.\n\n6\nIt is the Government\u2019s responsibility to present substantial evidence to support the finding\nof a nexus, or rational connection, between the Applicant\u2019s conduct and the holding of a security\nclearance.  If such a case has been established, the burden then shifts to the Applicant to go forward\nwith evidence in rebuttal, explanation or mitigation which is sufficient to overcome or outweigh the\nGovernment\u2019s case.  The Applicant bears the ultimate burden of persuasion in proving that it is\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant his a security clearance.\nIn this case the Government has met its initial burden of proving that the Applicant has been\nfinancially irresponsible (Guideline F).  This evidence indicates poor judgment, unreliability and\nuntrustworthiness on the part of the Applicant.  Because of the scope and nature of the Applicant's\nconduct, I conclude there is a nexus or connection with his security clearance eligibility.\nConsidering all of the evidence, the Applicant has introduced persuasive evidence in rebuttal,\nexplanation or mitigation that is sufficient to overcome the Government's case.  With respect to his\nfinances, the Applicant poor financial history was caused by circumstances beyond his control,\nnamely his job lay off and his inability to find suitable employment.  Since his current employment,\nhe has been paying his federal taxes.  His wages are voluntarily being garnished and he is paying\nthem off in a systematic manner.  He is also paying making payments toward his medical bills.  With\nrespect to the debt that he believes he does not owe, he has recently placed his dispute in writing with\nthe creditor, and with the credit reporting agencies requesting that they remove the debt from his\ncredit report.  Under the circumstances, he has made a good faith effort to resolve his indebtedness,\nand there is evidence of financial rehabilitation.  He is paying his delinquent debts and plans to\ncontinue to pay them on a monthly basis until they are paid off.  He is also saving money.  The\nApplicant has demonstrated that he can properly handle his financial affairs.  \nUnder Guideline F (Financial Considerations), Disqualifying Conditions 19(a) inability or\nunwillingness to satisfy debts; 19(c) a history of not meeting financial obligation; and 19(e)\nconsistent spending beyond one\u2019s means, which may be indicated by excessive indebtedness,\nsignificant negative cash flow, high debt-to-income ration, and/or other financial analysis apply.\nMitigating Conditions 20(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely\nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical\nemergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual has acted responsibly under the\ncircumstances, 20(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there\nare clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control and 20(d) the individual\ninitiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts also apply.\nAccordingly, I find for the Applicant under Guideline F (Financial Considerations).  \nIn addition to the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in this case, I have also considered\nthe \u201cwhole person\u201d concept.  The Applicant is 57 years of age and is a senior engineer.  He has an\nimpressive resume and extensive experience and education in the field of engineering, but over the\npast eleven years, has unfortunately encountered bad luck in his efforts to secure a respectable,\ndecent paying job.  Since gaining full time employment, he is paying his delinquent debts.  His taxes\nare being paid and so are his delinquent medical bills.  His only other delinquent debt has now been\n\n7\nproperly disputed and no longer appears on his Trans Union credit report.  In order to provide\nfinancial support for his family, he has moved across the country to find suitable employment,\nhaving to leave his family behind.  Considering all of the facts and circumstances, I find that he has\nmitigated the concerns arising from his financial considerations. \nI have considered the evidence as a whole, including each of the appropriate factors and\nguidelines in the Directive.  I have carefully considered the Applicant\u2019s testimony and his\ndocumentary evidence.  On balance, I conclude that his mitigating evidence is sufficient to overcome\nthe evidence of unreliability and unsuitability for a security clearance.  Therefore, it is clearly\nconsistent with the interests of national security to grant him a security clearance.  \nOn balance, it is concluded that the Applicant has overcome the Government's case opposing\nhis request for a  security clearance.  Accordingly, the evidence supports a finding for the Applicant\nas to the factual and conclusionary allegations expressed in Paragraph 1 for the Government's\nStatement of Reasons.  \nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal findings For or Against the Applicant on the allegations in the SOR, as required by\nParagraph 25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive are:\nParagraph 1 For the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.a.:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.b:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.c:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.d:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.e:\nFor the Applicant.\n   \n   \nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant.\n  Darlene Lokey Anderson\nAdministrative Judge\n\n8\n",

    "summary": "findings of fact. Findings of Fact In his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the factual allegations under Guideline B and denied the allegation under Guideline E. His admissions in his answer to the SOR and at the hearing are incorporated in my findings of fact. I make the following findings: Applicant is a 47-year-old native of Sudan. He completed high school in Sudan, attended a maritime college in Yugoslavia from 1980 to 1983, and worked as a third mate on a Sudanese ship after graduation. He came to the U.S. from Sudan in November 1987 (GX 3 at 9-10; Tr. 79), and he became a U.S. citizen in November 1992, at which time he renounced his Sudanese citizenship and surrendered his Sudanese passport (GX 3 at 10). From November 1994 to July 1997, he worked as a courier for a commercial parcel carrier. He served as a seaman on various U.S. merchant ships from July 1997 to February 2002. He has worked as a linguist for federal contractors from March 2003 until the present. He worked in Kuwait in March 2003, Iraq in June 2003, Guantanamo from March 2004 until March 2006, and again in Iraq from February to July 2007 (GX 2 at 5; AX K; AX P).

Borgstrom, Esquire, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nFOREMAN, LeRoy F., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant submitted his Security Clearance Application (SF 86) on November 17, \n2004.  On October 9, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued \na Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its preliminary decision to deny \nhis application, citing security concerns under Guidelines B (Foreign Influence) and E \n(Personal Conduct). The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of \nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative \nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective \nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on October 18, 2007; answered the \nSOR on October 22, 2007; submitted a clarification of his answer on October 29, 2007, \nand requested a hearing before an administrative judge. DOHA received the request on \nOctober 31, 2007.  Department Counsel was prepared to proceed on November 30, \n2007, and the case was assigned to me on December 6, 2007. DOHA issued a notice \nof hearing on December 14, 2007, and I convened the hearing as scheduled on January \nMarch 11,2008\n\n \n2 \n \n \n16, 2008. Government Exhibits (GX) 1 through 4 were admitted in evidence without \nobjection. Applicant testified on his own behalf, presented the testimony of one witness, \nand submitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AX) A through HH, which were admitted without \nobjection. The record closed at the end of the hearing.  DOHA received the transcript of \nthe hearing (Tr.) on January 22, 2008.  Eligibility for access to classified information is \ngranted. \n \nProcedural Ruling \n \nDepartment Counsel requested that I take administrative notice of relevant facts \nabout Sudan (Tr. 28). The request and the documents attached as enclosures were not \nadmitted in evidence but are attached to the record as Hearing Exhibits (HX) I and II.  I \ntook administrative notice as requested by Department Counsel (Tr. 33-34).  The facts \nadministratively noticed are set out below in my findings of fact. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the factual allegations under \nGuideline B and denied the allegation under Guideline E.  His admissions in his answer \nto the SOR and at the hearing are incorporated in my findings of fact.  I make the \nfollowing findings: \n \nApplicant is a 47-year-old native of Sudan. He completed high school in Sudan, \nattended a maritime college in Yugoslavia from 1980 to 1983, and worked as a third \nmate on a Sudanese ship after graduation. He came to the U.S. from Sudan in \nNovember 1987 (GX 3 at 9-10; Tr. 79), and he became a U.S. citizen in November \n1992, at which time he renounced his Sudanese citizenship and surrendered his \nSudanese passport (GX 3 at 10).  From November 1994 to July 1997, he worked as a \ncourier for a commercial parcel carrier.  He served as a seaman on various U.S. \nmerchant ships from July 1997 to February 2002.  He has worked as a linguist for \nfederal contractors from March 2003 until the present.  He worked in Kuwait in March \n2003, Iraq in June 2003, Guantanamo from March 2004 until March 2006, and again in \nIraq from February to July 2007 (GX 2 at 5; AX K; AX P).  He has held a security \nclearance since May 2003.   \n \nApplicant submitted his SF 86 in November 2004, seeking to obtain a top secret \nclearance (Tr. 8).  His application was supported with \u201cutmost enthusiasm\u201d by a Marine \nCorps captain, based on observation of Applicant\u2019s performance for six months as a \nlinguist at the Navy and Marine Corps Intelligence Training Center (AX A).   \n \nApplicant\u2019s supervisor at Guantanamo, a Navy lieutenant commander, described \nhim as a talented, dependable linguist, a person of \u201chighest caliber intellect and \nintegrity,\u201d and a trusted friend (AX B).  An Army first lieutenant commended him for his \nperformance, dedication, and personal courage at Guantanamo (AX C). His civilian \nproject manager described him as a \u201cstellar and dedicated employee\u201d who accepted \ndifficult assignments and volunteered to be a team leader (AX L). One of his \n\n \n3 \n \n \nsubordinates in Guantanamo described him as \u201cof the highest caliber\u201d and \u201ca positive \nasset\u201d to any organization having the opportunity to utilize his skills (AX M). Another \nsubordinate described him as an excellent leader, highly motivated, and enthusiastic \n(AX N). His performance reviews as a linguist at Guantanamo were outstanding (AX G, \nH, and I), and he received numerous commendations for his service (AX P, Q, R, S, T, \nand U). \n \nHis supervisor in Iraq, an Air Force major, commended him for his outstanding \nduty performance and described him as a \u201ctrue patriot\u201d for volunteering for more than 80 \ndifficult and extremely dangerous assignments to counter-insurgency missions (AX D).  \nOne of his coworkers described his performance as a linguist in Iraq in glowing terms, \ndescribing him as \u201cunquestionably one of the best,\u201d and strongly recommending him for \na position of trust (AX F). \n \nApplicant worked as a linguist at the U.S. Military Academy during cadet summer \ntraining in 2006.  A fellow linguist who worked with him described him as pleasant, hard \nworking, dedicated, and professional (AX O). He received a certificate of appreciation \nfrom the Director, Department of Military Instruction (an Army colonel) for his \n\u201cexceptional professionalism, motivation, and dedication to duty\u201d during the summer \ntraining (AX V). \n \n \nApplicant was married to a native-born U.S. citizen in March 1989 and divorced \nin May 1994.  He married his current spouse, also a native-born U.S. citizen, in \nNovember 1995. He has four sons from his current marriage, ages 11, 9, and 8 months, \nwho are native-born U.S. citizens. The two youngest are twins (Tr. 81). \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s spouse testified he is a very honest, trustworthy person, and is very \nresponsible and caring toward his family (Tr. 117-18).  She testified their marriage is \nbuilt on commitment and sacrifice (Tr. 118).  Applicant is frequently away from home, \nbut he calls frequently to check on the children (Tr. 118).   \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s parents were citizens and residents of Sudan. His mother died in \n1993 and his father died in 1996.  His father owned a blacksmith shop, and his mother \ndid not work outside the home (Tr. 83-84).  He has two brothers who are citizens and \nresidents of the U.S. (Tr. 85).  One brother drives a vehicle for handicapped persons, \nand the other is a government contractor currently working for the U.S. in Iraq (Tr. 86).   \n \n \nApplicant declined to sponsor his two brothers for immigration to the U.S. \nbecause he was concerned about an appearance of a conflict of interest.  They made \ntheir way to the U.S. and became citizens without his help.  He testified he wanted to be \n\u201con the safe side\u201d as far as his loyalty to the U.S. was concerned (Tr. 52). \n \nApplicant has three brothers who are citizens and residents of Sudan.  The \noldest is a 55-year-old blacksmith and lives in Khartoum. He last saw this brother in \n2000. He rarely communicates with this brother and has had no contract for at least a \nyear (Tr. 87).  His 49-year-old brother worked with the older brother as a blacksmith.  \n\n \n4 \n \n \nApplicant is unaware of this brother\u2019s current occupation, but knows he lives in \nOmdurman (Tr. 88-89).  He rarely communicates with this brother and saw him last in \n2000 (Tr. 90). The youngest brother lives in Khartoum, previously worked as a \nblacksmith, and is now unemployed (Tr. 90-91).  None of his brothers served in the \nmilitary or have ever been connected with the government, nor have they been detained \nor questioned by government authorities or subjected to violence by government \nauthorities, rebels, or terrorists (Tr. 92).  None of his siblings in Sudan have ever visited \nhim in the U.S. (Tr. 101). \n \nApplicant has four sisters who are citizens and residents of Sudan. The oldest \nlives in Al Ubayyid and is married to a tailor (Tr. 93).  Applicant does not know how \nmany children she has (Tr. 93).  The second oldest is divorced and is unemployed (Tr. \n94-95). The third oldest is widowed and disabled.  The youngest sister is married, but \nApplicant knows little about her (Tr. 99). \n \nApplicant sent money to care for his widowed and disabled sister and his \nbrother\u2019s daughter, because he promised his mother he would make sure they were \ncared for (Tr. 126). The money was wired by Western Union by Applicant\u2019s spouse, who \nhas a power of attorney that enables her to send money to Applicant\u2019s siblings on his \nbehalf (Tr. 103-04, 119-20).  Until November 2007, he sent his disabled sister about \n$300 per month (Tr. 95, 98, 126). When Applicant learned that sending his disabled \nsister money raised security concerns, he broke the promise to his mother and stopped \nsending his sister money (Tr. 54).  He continues to send about $500 a month to his \nbrother, a U.S. citizen working for the U.S. government in Iraq, for the care of his \nbrother\u2019s daughter, who lives in Sudan (Tr. 54, 96-97, 125-27). \n \nNone of Applicant\u2019s siblings know he works for the U.S. government.  They \nbelieve he works on a ship. He has intentionally concealed his occupation from them \nbecause he knows they can be threatened (Tr. 104).   \n \n \nApplicant traveled to Sudan in 1993 for his mother\u2019s funeral and in January 1996, \nwhile on his honeymoon, to introduce his wife to his family (AX GG and HH).  He \ntraveled to Sudan in March 1996 to attend his father\u2019s funeral and be with his family for \nthe mourning period (AX HH).  He visited Sudan for about three days in 2000 while \nserving on a U.S.-flagged ship that docked in Sudan to unload humanitarian aid \nsupplies.  While the ship was in port, he visited some of his siblings who lived close to \nKhartoum (GX 2 at 5; AX FF; Tr. 100-01). \n \n \nApplicant was sincere and scrupulously candid during the hearing, but he was \npuzzled and distraught about the security concerns raised in the SOR.  Several times \nhe stated he could not understand what he had done to trigger any security concerns \n(Tr. 50, 52, 140). \n \n \nI take administrative notice of the following adjudicative facts about Sudan.  \nSudan became an independent country on January 1, 1956 under a provisional \nconstitution.  There were 17 years of civil war, ending in 1972 but beginning again in \n\n \n5 \n \n \nJanuary 1983.  After a series of regional efforts to end the civil war, a peace agreement \nwas signed in January 2005, establishing a new Government of National Unity and an \ninterim Government of Southern Sudan, and providing for a six-year period to \nimplement the peace agreement.   \n \nImplementation of the peace agreement has faltered. A rebellion in Darfur has \ncaused deaths of tens of thousands. There are an estimated 2 million displaced persons \nin Sudan, and 234,000 refugees in neighboring Chad. The State Department has found \nthe Sudanese government complicit in the bombing, murder, and rape of innocent \ncivilians in Darfur, and the Sudanese president has refused to honor his commitments \nto end the violence in Darfur.   \n \nSudan has been designated as a state sponsor of terrorism since August 1993. It \nis under a broad U.S. trade embargo. In two executive orders, the policies and actions \nof Sudan have been declared by the President of the U.S. to constitute \u201can unusual and \nextraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States\u201d \nbecause of support for international terrorism, ongoing efforts to destabilize neighboring \ngovernments, human rights violations, and the pervasive role played by the government \nof Sudan in the petroleum and petrochemical industries in Sudan. \n \nSudan has a poor human rights record. Serious problems include genocide in \nDarfur; extrajudicial killings; torture, beatings, rape, and other cruel and inhumane \ntreatment by security forces; arbitrary arrest and detention; infringement of personal \nrights; and executive interference with the judiciary. The government and security forces \nmonitor internet communications. Terrorist groups seek opportunities to attack U.S. \ncitizens and interests.  \n \nPolicies \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d  Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  As Commander in Chief, the President has \u201cthe authority to . \n. . control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether \nan individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position . . . that will give that person \naccess to such information.\u201d  Id. at 527.  The President has authorized the Secretary of \nDefense or his designee to grant applicants eligibility for access to classified information \n\u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d  Exec. \nOr. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as \namended and modified.   \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG).  These guidelines are not \ninflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common \nsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n\n \n6 \n \n \n \n \nThe government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information.  This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours.  Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no \nsense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. Or. \n10865 \u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is not necessarily a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  It is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance \n \n \nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information.  The government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR.  See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994).  The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability.  See ISCR Case No. 95-\n0611 at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).   \n \n \nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that \nit is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security \nclearance.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002).  \u201c[S]ecurity \nclearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d  Egan, 484 \nU.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline B (Foreign Influence) \n \n \nThe SOR alleges Applicant has brothers and sisters who are citizens and \nresidents of Sudan (\u00b6 1.a), he sends $200 a month to a sister in Sudan (\u00b6 1.b), and he \ntraveled to Sudan in 1997 and 2000 (\u00b6 1.c).  He admitted all these allegations. \n \nThe security concern relating to Guideline B is set out in AG & 6 as follows: \n \nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual \nhas divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or \n\n \n7 \n \n \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by \nany foreign interest. Adjudication under this Guideline can and should \nconsider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or \nfinancial interest is located, including, but not limited to, such \nconsiderations as whether the foreign country is known to target United \nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a \nrisk of terrorism.   \n \n \nTwo disqualifying conditions under this guideline are relevant to this case.  First, \na disqualifying condition may be raised by \u201ccontact with a foreign family member, \nbusiness or professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident \nin a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, \ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion.\u201d  AG \u00b6 7(a).  Second, a disqualifying \ncondition may be raised by \u201cconnections to a foreign person, group, government, or \ncountry that create a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to \nprotect sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s desire to help a foreign \nperson, group, or country by providing that information.\u201d  AG \u00b6 7(b).  The totality of an \napplicant\u2019s family ties to a foreign country as well as each individual family tie must be \nconsidered.  ISCR Case No. 01-22693 at 7 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2003).  \n \n \nGuideline B is not limited to countries hostile to the United States.  \u201cThe United \nStates has a compelling interest in protecting and safeguarding classified information \nfrom any person, organization, or country that is not authorized to have access to it, \nregardless of whether that person, organization, or country has interests inimical to \nthose of the United States.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 02-11570 at 5 (App. Bd. May 19, 2004).  \n \n \nFurthermore, friendly nations can have profound disagreements with the United \nStates over matters they view as important to their vital interests or national security. \nFinally, we know friendly nations have engaged in espionage against the United States, \nespecially in the economic, scientific, and technical fields.  See ISCR Case No. 00-\n0317, 2002 DOHA LEXIS 83 at **15-16 (App. Bd. Mar. 29, 2002).  Nevertheless, the \nnature of a nation\u2019s government, its relationship with the U.S., and its human rights \nrecord are relevant in assessing the likelihood that an applicant\u2019s family members are \nvulnerable to government coercion. The risk of coercion, persuasion, or duress is \nsignificantly greater if the foreign country has an authoritarian government, a family \nmember is associated with or dependent upon the government, or the country is known \nto conduct intelligence operations against the U.S. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 7(a) differs from previous adjudicative guidelines in that it requires a \n\u201cheightened risk.\u201d  Applicant\u2019s siblings do not live in Darfur, where the worst violence \nand human rights violations have occurred.  He has concealed his involvement with the \nU.S. government.  His siblings\u2019 belief that he works as a crew member on a ship is \nplausible, because his siblings know he attended the maritime college in Yugoslavia \nand visited some of them in Khartoum when he was serving as a seaman on a U.S.-\nflagged ship.  He has taken positive steps to minimize the risk posed by the presence of \n\n \n8 \n \n \nhis siblings in Sudan, but the risk is nevertheless \u201cheightened\u201d because of the internal \nturmoil, human rights violations, and activities of terrorists in Sudan.  I conclude AG \u00b6 \n7(a) is raised.   \n \nThe presence of Applicant\u2019s siblings in Sudan also raises the \u201cpotential conflict of \ninterest\u201d in AG \u00b6 7(b).  Thus, I conclude AG \u00b6 7(b) also is raised. \n \nApplicant\u2019s financial support of his widowed and disabled sister and travel to \nSudan has no independent security significance other than as evidence of his ties of \nobligation to his family members. He terminated his financial support of his sister in \nNovember 2007. His travel to Sudan in 2000 was as crew member of a U.S.-flagged \nship on a humanitarian mission, and it has no independent security significance. \n \n \nSince the government produced substantial evidence to raise the disqualifying \nconditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a) and (b), the burden shifted to Applicant to produce evidence to \nrebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  An applicant has \nthe burden of proving a mitigating condition, and the burden of disproving it never shifts \nto the government.  See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).   \n \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline can be mitigated by showing that \u201cthe \nnature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which these persons are \nlocated, or the positions or activities of those persons in that country are such that it is \nunlikely the individual will be placed in a position of having to choose between the \ninterests of a foreign individual, group, organization, or government and the interests of \nthe U.S.\u201d  AG \u00b6 8(a).   \n \n \nApplicant does not appear to have strong emotional attachments to his siblings in \nSudan, but he has demonstrated a sense of obligation by his financial assistance to a \ndisabled sister and his brother\u2019s daughter and by his occasional contact with his \nsiblings.  He has reduced the likelihood of a conflict of interest by concealing his work \nfor the U.S. from his siblings.  However, due to the nature of the government of Sudan \nand the continuing terrorism and violence in that country, there is still some likelihood \nthat he might have to choose between the interests of the U.S. and those of one or \nmore siblings.  I conclude AG \u00b6 8(a) is not established. \n \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing \u201cthere is \nno conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of loyalty or obligation to the \nforeign person, group, government, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such \ndeep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be \nexpected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest.\u201d  AG \u00b6 8(b). \n \nUnder the old adjudicative guidelines, a disqualifying condition based on foreign \nfamily members could not be mitigated unless an applicant could establish that the \nfamily members were not \u201cin a position to be exploited.\u201d  Directive \u00b6 E2.A2.1.3.1.  The \nAppeal Board consistently applied this mitigating condition narrowly, holding that an \napplicant should not be placed in a position where he or she is forced to make a choice \n\n \n9 \n \n \nbetween the interests of the family member and the interests of the U.S. See ISCR \nCase No. 03-17620 at 4 (App. Bd. Apr. 17, 2006); ISCR Case No. 03-24933 at 6 (App. \nBd. Jul. 28, 2005); ISCR Case No. 03-02382 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 15, 2005); ISCR Case \nNo. 03-15205 at 3 (App. Bd. Jan. 21, 2005).  Thus, an administrative judge was not \npermitted to apply a balancing test to assess the extent of the security risk.  Under the \nnew guidelines, however, the potentially conflicting loyalties may be weighed to \ndetermine if an applicant \u201ccan be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of \nthe U.S. interest.\u201d   \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s sense of obligation to his siblings is more than minimal, but his \nrelationships and loyalties in the U.S. are exceptionally strong.  He has lived in the U.S. \nfor more than 20 years and has been a U.S. citizen for 15 years.  He has worked as a \nlinguist for the U.S. for five years and held a clearance for most of that time. He is \nmarried to a native-born U.S. citizen and has four sons who are native-born U.S. \ncitizens.  Two of his four brothers are U.S. citizens, and one is working for the U.S. in \nIraq. He has put his life on the line for the U.S., volunteering for more than 80 \ndangerous counter-insurgency missions in Iraq. He is trusted and highly regarded by his \ncolleagues and supervisors.   \n \n \nApplicant has demonstrated by his actions that he will resolve a conflict of \ninterest in favor of the U.S. He broke his promise to his mother and stopped sending \nmoney to his disabled sister, because he feared that sending money to his sister would \njeopardize his security clearance.  He declined to sponsor his two brothers for \nimmigration to the U.S. to avoid raising any question about his loyalty to the U.S.  I \nconclude AG \u00b6 8(b) is established. \n \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline also may be mitigated by showing that \n\u201ccontact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and infrequent that there is \nlittle likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign influence or exploitation.\u201d  AG \u00b6 8(c).  \nThere is a rebuttable presumption that contacts with an immediate family member in a \nforeign country are not casual.  ISCR Case No. 00-0484 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 1, 2002).  \nAlthough Applicant\u2019s contacts with his siblings are infrequent, he has not rebutted the \npresumption that they are not casual.  I conclude AG \u00b6 8(c) is not established. \n \nGuideline E (Personal Conduct) \n \n \nThe SOR alleges, \u201cYour colleagues, with whom you worked at GTMO in Cuba \nfrom 2004 to 2006, were not entirely comfortable recommending you for access to \nclassified information.\u201d Applicant denied this allegation. At the hearing, Department \nCounsel announced that the government would not pursue this allegation and would not \nprovide any evidence regarding it (Tr. 27). Accordingly, this allegation is resolved in \nApplicant\u2019s favor. \n \n\n \n10 \n \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and \nother permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.  Some of the factors in \nAG \u00b6 2(a) were addressed above, but some warrant additional comment. \n \n \nApplicant has held a clearance for almost five years and volunteered for \nnumerous dangerous assignments with U.S. military units. Paradoxically, the inquiry \nabout his suitability for a clearance was triggered by an application for a higher level of \nclearance.  He was sincere and exceptionally candid at the hearing.  The intensity of his \ncommitment to the interests of the U.S. is not fully reflected on the written transcript, but \nit was patently obvious from his tone of voice and body language at the hearing.  He \nhas backed up his words with actions by breaking his promise to his mother to \nfinancially support his disabled sister and declining to sponsor his two brothers for \nimmigration to the U.S. \n \n \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline B, and \nevaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has \nmitigated the security concerns based on foreign influence.  The government chose not \nto pursue the allegations under Guideline E and presented no evidence to support \nthem.  Accordingly, I conclude Applicant has carried his burden of showing that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant him continued eligibility for access to \nclassified information. \n \n\n \n11 \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nI make the following formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set \nforth in the SOR, as required by Directive \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B (Foreign Influence): FOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E (Personal Conduct): FOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_________________ \nLeRoy F.

On March 28, 2007, DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons  (SOR)\n1\ndetailing the basis for its decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline B (Foreign Influence)\nof the revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) issued on December 29, 2005, and implemented by the\nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. The revised guidelines were\nprovided to Applicant when the SOR was issued. Applicant answered the SOR in writing on April\n11, 2007, and elected to have the case decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. Department\nCounsel submitted the Government\u2019s written case on June 27, 2007. A complete copy of the file of\nrelevant material (FORM) was provided to Applicant, who was afforded an opportunity to file\nobjections and submit material to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the disqualifying conditions.\nApplicant received the FORM on July 9, 2007, and responded on August 3, 2007.

I do not take administrative notice of the facts contained in FE IV. In accordance with\nISCR Case No. 03-21434 (App. Bd. Feb. 20, 2007), I will consider the document as evidence.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant is a 45-year-old employee of a defense contractor. She has a Ph.D. in electrical\nengineering. Applicant married in 1988. She has two children, ages 15 and 11.\nApplicant was born in the People\u2019s Republic of China. Applicant\u2019s grandparents worked for\nthe Chinese government before the Communist revolution. Because Applicant\u2019s grandparents\nworked in the \u201cold government,\u201d and were well off in the \u201cold society,\u201d Applicant was marked since\nbirth as the descendant of the \u201cexploiting class,\u201d and was considered the target and enemy of the\n\nApplicant\u2019s response to FORM; HE I at 4-5.\n2\nHE I at 6.\n3\nApplicant\u2019s response to FORM.\n4\nId.\n5\nId.\n6\nItem 4 at 7.\n7\n4\nCommunist Party. During the Cultural Revolution (1966-1976), Applicant and her family were\ndeprived of equal opportunity rights in many aspects of their lives.2\nIn 1988 to 1989, dissatisfaction with the Chinese government and growing economic\nhardship caused by high inflation, provided the backdrop for a large-scale protest movement by\nstudents, intellectuals and other parts of a disaffected urban population. University students and\nother citizens camped out in Beijing\u2019s Tiananmen Square to mourn the death of a reformist leader\nand to protest against those who would slow reform. Their protests, which grew despite government\nefforts to contain them, called for an end to official corruption and for defense of freedoms\nguaranteed by the Chinese constitution. Protests also spread to many other cities. Martial law was\ndeclared on May 20, 1989. Late on June 3, and early on the morning of June 4, 1989, military units\nwere brought into Beijing. They used armed force to clear demonstrators from the streets. There\nwere no official estimates of deaths, but most observers believe that casualties numbered in the\nhundreds. After June 4, while foreign governments expressed horror at the brutal suppression of the\ndemonstrators, the central government eliminated remaining sources of organized opposition,\ndetained large numbers of protesters, and required political reeducation not only for students but also\nfor large numbers of party cadre and government officials.3\nApplicant was a student in China in 1989. She, her husband, and her brother were in Beijing\non June 4, 1989, and witnessed the killing of the demonstrators and fellow students. Applicant states\nthis caused them to \u201clos[e] faith in the Chinese government, and were made strong believers in a\ndemocratic society.\u201d  All three left China in 1989, and arrived in the United States at the end of\n4\n1989. Applicant Anglicized her name, and enrolled in a Ph.D. program at a university. Her husband\nand brother were studying for their Master\u2019s degrees at two other universities. Applicant received\nher Ph.D. in June 1994.5\nApplicant\u2019s husband received a green card (permanent residency), for employment with a\nU.S. company in 1993, or earlier. Applicant received her green card in 1993, after her husband\nreceived his. Applicant became a U.S. citizen on February 3, 2000. As part of the oath of citizenship,\nApplicant renounced and abjured all allegiance to China. Her last Chinese passport expired in 1999.\nShe does not consider herself a dual citizen.  Applicant visited China in 1999, 2000, 2001, 2003, and\n6\n2004.7\nApplicant and her immediate family are entrenched in their community. They bought their\nfirst house in 1994. Both her children were born in the U.S., and attend public school. Applicant and\nher husband are involved in youth sports and other civic and community events. In August 2006,\n\nApplicant\u2019s response to FORM.\n8\nId.\n9\nId.\n10\nId.\n11\nId.; FE III.\n12\nApplicant\u2019s response to FORM.\n13\n5\nthey purchased a new house for more than $650,000. They also have more than $100,000 in her\n401(k) and bank account.8\nApplicant\u2019s brother became a U.S. citizen in May 2001. He obtained two Master\u2019s degrees\nfrom a preeminent U.S. university. He has worked for a well-known U.S. financial management\ncorporation for several years. His wife is also a U.S. citizen. The corporation sent Applicant\u2019s\nbrother on an assignment to China to set up a branch there. He is in China on a visa that allows a\nforeigner to work in China. This type of visa is good for one year, but may be renewed. His current\nvisa expires in July 2008. Applicant believes it is his brother\u2019s intention to return to the U.S. after\nhe completes his assignment.  \n9\nApplicant\u2019s mother and father are both 71 years old. They retired more than ten years ago.\nHer mother was a teacher and her father worked for a small private company. After they retired,\nApplicant\u2019s parents moved to the U.S. to live with Applicant and her family. Her mother became\na U.S. citizen earlier this year. Her father has a green card. He is studying English for the citizenship\nexam, and plans on becoming a U.S. citizen.  \n10\nApplicant\u2019s parents-in-law are citizens and residents of China. Her father-in-law is 81, and\nhis mother-in-law is 72 years old. They both are in poor health. They are presumably retired, but\nApplicant did not provide any details about them such as what they did before retirement, any\nassociation with the Chinese government, or whether they were/are members of the Communist\nParty. Applicant stated that neither of them speaks English, and that they found it difficult to adjust\nto the U.S., so they decided to spend their golden years in China.11\nApplicant\u2019s husband is a Chinese citizen. China requires a visa for entry by U.S. citizens.12\nHer husband was reluctant to become a U.S. citizen because of his parents\u2019 health issues. He wanted\nto be able to go to China on a moment\u2019s notice if there was a medical emergency, something he\nmight not be able to do if he had to wait the period of up to two weeks it could take to obtain a visa.\nHe applied for U.S. citizenship in July 2007, in order to assist Applicant to obtain a security\nclearance.13\nThe President of Applicant\u2019s company wrote a letter on her behalf.

Her company considers her a valuable asset, and\ndeems it vital for her clearance to be granted.14\nChina is a large and economically powerful country, with a population of more than a billion\npeople and an economy growing at about 10% per year. China has an authoritarian government,\ndominated by the Chinese Communist Party. China has a poor record with respect to human rights,\nsuppresses political dissent, and its practices include arbitrary arrest and detention, forced\nconfessions, torture, and mistreatment of prisoners. China has a very active intelligence network,\nengages in military and economic espionage, and specifically targets the U.S.15\nPOLICIES\n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d  As Commander in Chief, the President has\n16\n\u201cthe authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national security and to determine\nwhether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position . . . that will give that person\naccess to such information.\u201d  The President authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to\n17\ngrant applicants eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d  An applicant has the ultimate burden of\n18\ndemonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his or her\nsecurity clearance. The clearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations\nshould err, if they must, on the side of denials.  Any reasonable doubt about whether an applicant\n19\nshould be allowed access to sensitive information must be resolved in favor of protecting such\nsensitive information.  The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily\n20\na determination as to the loyalty of an applicant.  It is merely an indication that the applicant has not\nmet the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a\nclearance.  \n21\nThe revised Adjudicative Guidelines set forth potentially disqualifying conditions (DC) and\nmitigating conditions (MC) under each guideline. Additionally, each security clearance decision\nmust be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based on the relevant and material facts and\ncircumstances, the whole-person concept, along with the adjudicative process factors listed in the\nDirective and AG \u00b6 2(a).\n\n7\nConditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying, as well as those\nwhich would mitigate security concerns, are set forth and discussed in the conclusions section\nbelow.\nCONCLUSIONS\nI have carefully considered all the facts in evidence and the legal standards discussed above.\nI reach the following conclusions regarding the allegations in the SOR.\nGuideline B: Foreign Influence\nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual has divided\nloyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or induced to help a foreign person,\ngroup, organization, or government in a way that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure\nor coercion by any foreign interest. This raises a security concern under the foreign influence\nguideline. Adjudication under this guideline can and should consider the identity of the foreign\ncountry in which the foreign contact or financial interest is located, including, but not limited to,\nsuch considerations as whether the foreign country is known to target United States citizens to\nobtain protected information and/or is associated with a risk of terrorism.\nI considered all the Foreign Influence Disqualifying Conditions (FI DC), and specifically FI\nDC 7(a) (contact with a foreign family member, business or professional associate, friend, or other\nperson who is a citizen of or resident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk\nof foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion) and FI DC 7(d) (sharing\nliving quarters with a person or persons, regardless of citizenship status, if that relationship creates\na heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion). \nChina has an authoritarian government, dominated by the Communist Party, with a poor\nhuman rights record, and targets the U.S. for espionage. Applicant\u2019s contact and relationship with\nher husband and his parents, create a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement,\nmanipulation, pressure, or coercion. FI DC 7(a) and FI DC 7(d) are established for SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. and\n1.c. \nApplicant\u2019s parents have lived in the U.S. for a number of years. Her mother is now a U.S.\ncitizen. Her father is a permanent resident who plans on becoming a U.S. citizen. Her brother is a\nU.S. citizen working temporarily in China for a U.S. financial management corporation. I do not find\nthat Applicant\u2019s relationship or contact with her parents or brother creates a heightened risk of\nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion. No Foreign Influence\nDisqualifying Condition is applicable to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b. or 1.d. \nI considered all the Foreign Influence Mitigating Conditions (FI MC), and I especially\nconsidered FI MC 8(a) (the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which\nthese persons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in that country are such that\nit is unlikely that the individual will be placed in a position of having to choose between the interests\nof a foreign individual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the U.S.). China is\ninvolved in espionage against the United States. China\u2019s human rights record is such that it is clear\n\n8\nthat it would not hesitate to use its own citizens for espionage purposes. As such I am unable to find\nthat it is unlikely that Applicant will be placed in a position of having to choose between the\ninterests of her husband, his parents, or the Chinese government and the interests of the United\nStates. No Foreign Influence Mitigating Condition is applicable.\nWhole Person Analysis\nThe adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make\nan affirmative determination that the person is an acceptable security risk. Available, reliable\ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be considered in\nreaching a determination. In evaluating Applicant\u2019s case, I have considered the adjudicative process\nfactors listed in the Directive and AG \u00b6 2(a). I have also considered all the evidence, and every\nfinding of fact and conclusion discussed above. \nApplicant\u2019s family was targeted by the Chinese government, and deprived of equal\nopportunity rights, because her grandparents worked for the Chinese government before the\nCommunist revolution, and were well off in the \u201cold society.\u201d Applicant, her husband, and her\nbrother came to the U.S. after personally witnessing the atrocities associated with the Tiananmen\nSquare massacre. Her family has thrived in the U.S. She, her husband, and her brother are very\nhighly educated, accomplished professionals. She is respected in her job, and owns an expensive\nhome, and considerable U.S. assets. Her children are U.S. citizens living a typical American life.\nApplicant has no reason to sympathize with the Communist Chinese government. There is absolutely\nno reason to doubt Applicant\u2019s loyalty to the U.S. However, the Chinese government\u2019s espionage\nprogram, combined with its disdain for the human rights of its own citizens, creates the potential for\nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion. \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions and evaluating all the evidence\nin the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the Foreign Influence\nsecurity concerns.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nThe following are my conclusions as to each allegation in the SOR:\nParagraph 1.

LYNCH\nAPPEARANCES\nFOR GOVERNMENT\nD. Michael Lyles, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nSYNOPSIS\nApplicant is a 55-year-old employee of a defense contractor. Applicant\u2019s financial problems\nresulted due to his dairy farm loss. He incurred eight delinquent debts and a tax lien in 1995.\nApplicant has demonstrated he is financially responsible by resolving the debts. He received\ninformation that the tax lien has expired and is no longer collectible. Applicant has mitigated the\nfinancial considerations concern. He did not knowingly falsify his security clearance application.\nThus, he has mitigated the security concerns under personal conduct. Clearance is granted.\n\nPursuant to Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended\n1\nand modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (Jan. 2, 1992), as amended (Directive).\nInitially, when Applicant responded, he stated he did not believe a hearing would help him. \n2\nApplicant works out of the country. This was the first date that Applicant was in the U.S. and available for a\n3\nhearing. Also, initially Applicant requested a review on the record.\nApplicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, dated May 16, 2007.\n4\nGE 1 (Security Clearance Application, dated June 1, 2004).\n5\n2\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a\nsecurity clearance for Applicant. On April 20, 2007, DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons  (SOR)\n1\ndetailing the basis for its decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial\nConsiderations), and Guideline E (Personal Conduct) of the revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG)\nissued on December 29, 2005, and implemented by the Department of Defense for SORs issued after\nSeptember 1, 2006. The revised guidelines were provided to Applicant when the SOR was issued.\nApplicant answered the SOR on June 8, 2007, and elected to have a hearing before an administrative\njudge.  The case was assigned to me on October 10, 2007.  I scheduled a hearing for December 7,\n2\n3\n2007.\nThe hearing was convened as scheduled on December 7, 2007, to consider whether it is\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.\nGovernment exhibits (GE 1-6) were admitted. Applicant\u2019s exhibits (AE A-D) were admitted into\nthe record without objection. Testimony was taken from Applicant. The record was held open until\nDecember 14, 2007 for Applicant to submit additional material. Applicant did submit a packet of\ninformation that was marked AE E. The transcript (Tr.) was received on December 14, 2007. \nFINDINGS OF FACT\nAs to the factual allegations under Guidelines F and E, Applicant admitted that he was\nresponsible for the nine debts listed on the SOR, but also explained he paid all the debts except the\ntax lien, which he believed had expired, and he did not owe.  His admissions are incorporated herein\n4\nas findings of fact. \nApplicant is a 55-year-old employee of a defense contractor who  graduated from high school\nin 1970.  Applicant married his first wife in 1970. As a result of that marriage they had two children\nwho are now adults. He divorced his wife in 1973. Applicant has worked overseas since 2004 and\nhas been with his current employer since 2007.5\nApplicant earned his living as a dairy farmer for more than 20 years. He supported his family\nand paid his debts. However, he sold the family farm in 1983 due to financial problems but leased\nit back from the new owner. In 1991, Applicant sold the dairy herd.

Since Applicant spent his entire life doing business as a dairy owner, he did not have other\ntransferrable work skills. He took jobs with low wages and offshore work in another state after the\nfarm was sold.  He did not make a substantial income.\n6\nAfter Applicant\u2019s former spouse died in 1993, Applicant started living with a lady friend.\nThey lived together for a number of years (1993 until 2003).  She had multiple health problems and\nhe paid for her medical bills and surgeries.  While he was working in another state, he sent money\n7\nto his friend so that she could pay his bills. However, she did not do so. Thus, unknown to Applicant\nhe had delinquent bills.  Also, his friend would use his name and order various services such as pay-\n8\nfor-view movies. Applicant\u2019s friend sometimes used Applicant\u2019s money to pay her bills rather than\nhis.9\nIn the summer of 1994, Applicant received a tax notice from the IRS stating that he owed\nmoney for tax years 1990, 1991, 1992 and 1993. He had just lost the rental use of the farm and had\nno money to pay the IRS approximately $10,000. Also, he did not believe that he owed any money\nto the IRS due to the low wages that he made. Applicant had a dispute about the taxes owed due to\nhis deductions for the dairy farm. He had documents relating to tax deductions and his income in a\nshed on the remainder of his property. The documents were lost. He did not receive any offer of a\npayment plan and he had no money to pay the full amount. The IRS filed a tax lien against Applicant\nin 1995.10\nApplicant asked a local attorney about the tax issue and was told that after seven years the\nlien would expire or it would be uncollectible. Applicant was told that due to the Statute of\nLimitations (SOL) the tax was no longer owed.  In 1995, the IRS issued a Federal Tax Lien in the\namount of $11,000.  They never attempted to collect the money or garnish his pay.\n11\nAfter Applicant lost the lease on his farm, in addition to farming small grain, he worked as\nan electrician and worked in the local area for a period of time. He received training and decided to\nwork overseas building embassies for the U.S. Government to increase his income.\nApplicant had $2000 in delinquent debt listed on the SOR.  Applicant has paid the\n12\ndelinquent bills in allegations 1.b, through 1.i.. He did this when he was overseas by sending money\norders/traveler\u2019s checks. He proved he paid the SOR debts with copies of the checks at the hearing.13\n\nTr. 42.\n14\nTr. 14.\n15\nTr. 27.\n16\nAE B (Letter from Superintendent, dated December 4, 2007).\n17\nDepartment of the Navy v.

Dec. 19, 2002).\n21\n4\nApplicant\u2019s current net monthly income is $4,700. He earns more if there is overtime. He has\nfew expenses because his company overseas pays his housing as a benefit. He pays for his food and\nincidental expenses. He is current on all his bills. He also sends money to savings, which is now in\nexcess of $160,000 because his work overseas pays well and he has few expenses.  \n14\nOn June 6, 2004, when Applicant completed his security clearance application, he was\nworking 12-14 hour days away from home. He did not have any records with him.  He answered\n\u201cno\u201d to  Questions 27 and 28 concerning financial delinquencies and tax liens because he believed\nthe tax lien had expired. In addition, he believed because he was now receiving a refund from his\nfederal tax returns that the matter was settled. He also, at the time of the application, did not have\nknowledge about the delinquent debts.  The fact that he admitted they were his debts at the hearing,\n15\nafter seeing the SOR, does not render his answers unreasonable and his testimony incredible.\nApplicant has received refunds from his federal tax filings from 2002-2005. He produced his latest\nrefund check. He believes that the IRS would not send him refund checks if he actually owed them\nmoney.  He paid the delinquent debts as soon as he discovered them.\n16\nApplicant\u2019s current employer praises his work and positive attitude. He rates him as trusted\nand reliable. He endorses Applicant with respect to his professionalism, character, and reliability.\nHe recommends him for a security clearance.17\nPOLICIES\n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d  As Commander in Chief, the President has\n18\n\u201cthe authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national security and to determine\nwhether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position . . . that will give that person\naccess to such information.\u201d  The President authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to\n19\ngrant applicants eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d  An applicant has the ultimate burden of\n20\ndemonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his or her\nsecurity clearance.

The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a\n22\ndetermination as to the loyalty of an applicant.  It is merely an indication that the applicant has not\nmet the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a\nclearance.  \n23\nThe revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) set forth potentially disqualifying conditions (DC)\nand mitigating conditions (MC) under each guideline. Additionally, each security clearance decision\nmust be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based on the relevant and material facts and\ncircumstances, the whole-person concept, along with the adjudicative process factors listed in the\nDirective and AG \u00b6 2(a).\nCONCLUSIONS\nI have carefully considered all the facts in evidence and the legal standards discussed above.\nI reach the following conclusions regarding the allegations in the SOR.\nGuideline F: Financial Considerations\nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial obligations\nmay indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations,\nall of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to\nengage in illegal acts to generate funds.  \n24\nApplicant\u2019s history of delinquent debts establishes Financial Considerations Disqualifying\nCondition (FC DC) 19(a) (inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts) and FC DC 19(c)(a history of\nnot meeting financial obligations). His admissions and credit reports confirm the delinquent debts.\nApplicant did not believe he had to file income tax for the years 1990-1993 due to his low\nwages and the sale of the farm. However, there is substantial evidence of FC DC 20(g) (failure to\nfile annual Federal, state, or local income tax returns as required or the fraudulent filing of same).\nI have considered all the Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions (FC MC), and\nespecially considered FC MC 20(a) (the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or\noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the\nindividual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment), FC MC 20(b) (the conditions\nthat resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of\nemployment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or\nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances), FC MC 20(c) (the\nperson received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear indications that\n\nThe Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a \u201cgood faith\u201d effort to repay overdue creditors\n25\nor otherwise resolve debts:\nIn order to qualify for application of Financial Considerations Mitigating Condition 6, an applicant\nmust present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or some other\ngood-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant\u2019s debts. The Directive does not define the term\n\u2018good-faith.\u2019 However, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-faith \u2018requires a showing that\na person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or\nobligation.\u2019 Accordingly, an applicant must do more than merely show that he or she relied on a\nlegally available option (such as bankruptcy) in order to claim the benefit of Financial Considerations\nMitigating Condition 6. \n(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2004) (quoting ISCR Case No.\n99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 4, 2001)).\n26\nA levy must be made or proceeding in court begun to collect a federal tax lien within 10\nyears after a tax assessment is made. See 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6502; United States v. Galletti, 541 U.S. 114,\n119 (2004). The running of the statute of limitations is tolled during a bankruptcy proceeding, see \nUnited States v. Doe, 438 F. Supp. 2d 796 (S.D. Ohio 2006), by agreements (made before Dec. 20,\n2000), see United States v. Ryals, 480 F.3d 1101,    1106 (11  Cir. 2007),         or while an offer in\nth\ncompromise (made on or after Dec. 31, 1999) is pending. Id.  There was no evidence of    record     \nabout levies, judicial collections, agreements, offers in compromise, or bankruptcy. I infer that collec-\ntibility of the federal tax lien is currently barred by the 10-year statute of limitations.\nAG \u00b6 15.\n27\n6\nthe problem is being resolved or is under control), and FC MC 20(d) (the individual initiated a\ngood-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts).\nAlthough FC MC 20(a) does not provide a temporal or specific definition of what constitutes\n\u201crecent\u201d conduct, Applicant\u2019s overall conduct with creditors in resolving his debts shows he is now\nreliable, trustworthy and has good judgment. He has shown sufficient unusual circumstances to\nestablish that his financial problems are \u201cunlikely to recur\u201d due to the loss of the dairy farm and his\nlow wages for a long period of time, under 20(a). He thought he did not owe any tax for the years\nin question and then later he inquired and learned that the SOL in effect made the tax lien legally\nunenforceable. Moreover, Applicant began paying his non-tax related delinquent bills as soon as he\nlearned of them. He reasonably expected his friend to pay his bills, as he directed her. He acted in\na responsible manner. I find that FC MC 20(b) is applicable. FC MC 20(c) is applicable for the\nreasons stated above. Even though, Applicant did not receive counseling, he has resolved the\nproblem. He receives partial credit under FC MC 20(d) because he paid 8 of 9 debts. For the tax lien,\nhe did not make any effort to pay the IRS and does not receive credit for acting in good faith.  He\n25\nhas paid the majority of the debts listed in the SOR. The tax lien has expired.26\nGuideline E: Personal Conduct  \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to\ncomply with rules and regulations can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability,\ntrustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information. Of special interest is any failure to\nprovide truthful and candid answers during the security clearance process or any other failure to\ncooperate with the security clearance process.27\n\n7\nOn June 1, 2004, Applicant, in response to Question 28 a. and b. concerning financial\ndelinquencies (90 or 180 days overdue) answered \u201cno.\u201d When he responded to the questions, he\nfirmly believed he did not owe the tax lien. At first in 1995, he honestly believed he did not owe the\ntaxes. In 2004, he understood that the lien had expired. He did not intentionally falsify his security\nclearance application. As to the other small debts on the SOR, he was not aware of them. Appellant\nhas refuted the allegations of falsification.\nUnder DC 16 (a), the government established that Applicant omitted a material fact from his\nanswers to Question 28. He denied that he deliberately or knowingly falsified an answer to his\nsecurity clearance application. When a falsification allegation is controverted, the government has\nthe burden of proving it. Proof of an omission, standing alone, does not establish or prove an\nApplicant\u2019s intent or state of mind when the omission occurred. An administrative judge must\nconsider the record evidence as a whole to determine whether there is direct or circumstantial\nevidence regarding an Applicant\u2019s intent or state of mind at the time the omission occurred. For DC\n16 (a) (deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant and material facts from a\npersonnel security questionnaire.....) To apply, the government must establish that Applicant\u2019s\nomission was deliberate. I find that Appellant has mitigated the allegation under MC 17 (f) ( the\ninformation was not substantiated). Applicant did not intentionally falsify his security application.\nWhole Person Analysis\nThe adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make\nan affirmative determination that the person is an acceptable security risk. Available, reliable\ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be considered in\nreaching a determination. In evaluating Applicant\u2019s case, I have considered the adjudicative process\nfactors listed in the Directive and AG \u00b6 2(a). I have also considered all the evidence, and every\nfinding of fact and conclusion discussed above. \nApplicant had a history of good credit and no financial problems until his dairy farm was\nsold. Applicant paid eight of nine debts in the SOR as soon as he was made aware of the situation.\nHe is current on all his bills. The ninth debt is a tax lien. It is addressed in the next paragraph.\nApplicant talked with an attorney and was told that the tax lien had expired and was no\nlonger in effect. He had no money to pay at the time. He expected that his wages would be garnished\nbut that did not happen. He did not fraudulently answer questions on the security clearance\napplication in 2004 because at the time he filled out the SF 86, he did not have any delinquent debt.\nI found him reasonable, forthright and candid at the hearing.\nHe has the endorsement of his employer and has been working overseas since 2004. He has\na good position and is deemed reliable and trustworthy.\nIn sum, Applicant paid 8 of 9 delinquent debts. The ninth debt is not legally collectible and\ndoes not currently have any security significance. Applicant is not financially overextended, and\ntherefore he is not at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. See AG \u00b6 18.\nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions and evaluating all the evidence\nin the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has mitigated the security concerns based\non his financial issues, and personal conduct. He is eligible for a security clearance.\n\n8\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nThe following are my conclusions as to each allegation in the SOR:\nParagraph 1.  Guideline F:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a-1.i:             \nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2.  Guideline E:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a-2.b:\nFor Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.

His eligibility for a security clearance is denied. \n \nOn March 25, 2004, Applicant signed and certified a Security Clearance \nApplication (SF-86). On April 23, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals \n(DOHA) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns \nunder Guideline B, Foreign Influence and Guideline C, Foreign Preference. The action \nwas taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, \nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the \nPresident on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for \nSORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \nOctober 30, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \n \n \nOn May 12, 2008, Applicant answered the SOR in writing and elected to have a \nhearing before an administrative judge. On August 7, 2008, the case was assigned to   \nme. Prior to the hearing, on September 17, 2008, Applicant filed an objection to the \nGovernment\u2019s proposed exhibits. (HE A.) I convened a hearing on September 18, 2008, \nto consider whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue \na security clearance for Applicant. The Government called no witnesses, introduced four \nexhibits (Ex.), and offered facts in six official documents of the U.S. Government for \nadministrative notice. (HE I.)  Ex. 1 through 3 were admitted without objection.  Ex. 4 \nwas admitted over Applicant\u2019s objections. Applicant introduced ten exhibits, which were \nmarked as Ex. A through J and admitted to the record without objection. He called one \nwitness and testified on this own behalf.  \n \nAt the conclusion of the hearing, I left the record open until close of business \nSeptember 25, 2008 so that Applicant could, if he wished, submit additional information. \nApplicant timely filed two additional documents. The first document was an original \ndocument, prepared by the Embassy of Nigeria, memorializing its receipt, on \nSeptember 16, 2008, of Applicant\u2019s Nigerian passport. This document was offered as a \nsubstitute for a photocopy of the same, previously identified as Applicant\u2019s Ex. J. \nApplicant also offered another exhibit, identified as Ex. K. The substitute Ex. J and Ex. K \nwere admitted to the record without objection.  DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) of the \nhearing on September 30, 2008.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nThe SOR contains six allegations that raise security concerns under AG B, \nForeign Influence (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. through 1.f.) and two allegations that raise security \nconcerns under AG C, Foreign Preference (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a. and 2.b.). In his Answer to the \nSOR, Applicant admitted all allegations under adjudicative guidelines B and C, with \nexplanations. Applicant\u2019s admissions are admitted herein as findings of fact.   \n \n \nAfter a thorough review of the record in the case, including witness testimony, \nexhibits, relevant policies, and applicable adjudicative guidelines, I make the following \nfindings of fact:  \n \n \nApplicant is 44 years old and employed as a senior systems analyst by a \ngovernment contractor. He was first granted a government clearance in 2000. (Ex. 1; Tr. \n74-76.) \n \n \nApplicant was born in Nigeria and immigrated to the U.S. in 1987. In 1991, he \nearned an undergraduate degree in political science and in 1995 he earned a master\u2019s \ndegree in public administration. Both degrees were conferred by U.S. universities. He \nbecame a U.S. citizen in 2000.  (Ex. 1;  Ex. 2; Tr. 73-74, 88.) \n \n \nBefore becoming a U.S. citizen, Applicant maintained an active Nigerian \npassport.  After he became a U.S. citizen, he renewed his Nigerian passport in 2005.  \nWhen Applicant traveled to Nigeria in December 2003, September 2004, May 2005, and \n\n \n3 \n \n \nDecember 2006, he presented his Nigerian passport to enter and exit Nigeria.  \nApplicant used his Nigerian passport to enter and exit Nigeria because he found it more \nconvenient than applying for a visa and presenting his U.S. passport.  In a statement he \nsigned May 12, 2008, Applicant said he did not intend to travel to Nigeria on a Nigerian \npassport as long as he maintained an active secret clearance.  (Tr. 87-89; Ex. 3; Ex. A.) \n \n \nOn September 16, 2008, Applicant surrendered his active Nigerian passport, \nwhich had an expiration date in November 2010, to an authorized official of the Nigerian \ngovernment. The authorized official acknowledged in writing the receipt of Applicant\u2019s \nactive passport and stated that by surrendering his Nigerian passport, Applicant \nrenounced Nigerian citizenship. Applicant stated his allegiance to the United States. (Tr. \n108-109; Ex. 3; Ex. J.)  \n \n \nApplicant was married to a U.S. citizen from 1992 to 1996, when they divorced.  \nApplicant and his former wife are the parents of three children, ages 12, 14, and 16.  \n(Ex. 1; Ex. I; Tr. I, 174-177, 181-182.) \n \n \n  Applicant is the youngest of five children. He does not remember when his \nfather died. He was orphaned when his mother died in 1973. At various times, he \nresided with two sets of aunts and uncles.  When he was in high school, he resided with \none of his sisters and her family. One of the uncles who helped raise Applicant is \nrecently deceased. The deceased uncle\u2019s wife, Applicant\u2019s aunt, is a citizen and \nresident of Nigeria. The sister who helped raise Applicant is deceased, as is her \nhusband. They are survived by eight children, all of whom are citizens and residents of \nNigeria.  Most of these children are now young adults. Applicant has another sister who \nis a citizen and resident of Nigeria.  Her three children are also citizens and residents of \nNigeria. (Tr. 46, 48-50, 56, 87,115-117.) \n \n \nIn 1990, Applicant opened a bank account in Nigeria.  He deposited $40 in the \naccount.  He did not make any other deposits to the account.  Recently, when Applicant \ninquired as to the status of the account, he was told that the account had been closed. \nOn September 8, 2008, Applicant granted one of his nephews power of attorney to act \non his behalf, close the account, and provide him with documentation that the account \nhad been closed.  (Ex. C; Tr. 77-79.) \n \n \nApplicant and his older brother, who is also a U.S. citizen, send money to the \nnephews in Nigeria who are the sons of their deceased sister.  Applicant speaks on the \ntelephone with some of his nephews once or twice a month. He feels a moral obligation \nto provide for his deceased sister\u2019s children because she took care of him after their \nmother died and he was orphaned.  In September 2004, Applicant purchased two plots \nof land in Nigeria for approximately $10,000.  He purchased the land for the use of his \nnephews.  (Tr. 47. 83-84, 86, 101-102, 106-107, 119.) \n \n \nIn May and June of 2005, Applicant and his brother sent approximately $15,000 \nto the husband of their sister (both now deceased) so that a family house could be built \non some ancestral land in the Nigerian town where they had grown up.  The house was \n\n \n4 \n \n \n                                           \nto be for the benefit of the children of Applicant\u2019s sister. Applicant\u2019s land was not the \nsitus of the proposed ancestral home. Because title to the ancestral property is held by \nall members of the extended family in Nigeria, it cannot be sold. (51-56.) \n \n \nOn September 17, 2008, Applicant assigned his interest in the two plots of land \nhe owned in Nigeria to his older brother for $10,000.  (Ex. D; Tr. 42-45, 64-65.) \n \n \n \nApplicant owns a home in the U.S. He purchased the home in 2005 for \napproximately $200,000, and, at his hearing, he asserted that the property had a  \ncurrent market value of $450,000.  He also has two bank accounts in the U.S.  His \nannual salary is approximately $80,000. (Ex.E; Ex. K; Tr.80, 99-101.)  \n \n  \n \nApplicant\u2019s manager provided a letter of character reference.  He stated that \nApplicant was responsible, had pleasing manners, and was well-liked by his superiors \nand his colleagues.  (Ex. B.) \n \n  \n \nI take administrative notice of the following facts about Nigeria, drawn from  \nofficial US government documents:1 \n \nNigeria is a federal republic in western Africa composed of 36 states and a \ncapital territory.  It has a population of approximately 140 million, making it \nthe most populous nation in Africa, accounting for half of West Africa\u2019s \npeople.  Since gaining independence from Britain in 1960, Nigeria has \nexperienced periods of political instability and turmoil, as well as economic \ncrisis.  Nigerian political life has been scarred by conflict along both ethnic \nand geographic lines and dominated by military coups and long military-\nimposed transition programs rather than civilian rule. The military has \nruled Nigeria for approximately 28 of its 47 years since independence, and \nin May 1999, Nigeria returned to civilian rule. \n \nNigeria is home to over 250 ethnic groups. A majority of the people suffer \nfrom extreme poverty. Nigeria is divided along ethnic and religious lines \nbetween Muslims in the northern two-thirds of the country and Christians \nmixed with Muslims in the southern third.  In the eight years since the end \nof military rule, Nigeria has suffered from serious ethnic/religious conflicts. \nAreas of Nigeria are marked by serious instability and outbreaks of armed \nconflicts between religious, political, and ethnic factions. \n \n \n1 See U.S. Department of State, Background Note: Nigeria, dated July 2008; U.S. Department of State, \nTravel Warning: Nigeria, dated October 30, 2007; U.S. Department of State, Nigeria: Country Reports on \nHuman Rights Practices \u2013 2007, dated March 11, 2008;  Congressional Research Service, CRS Report \nfor Congress, Nigeria: Current Issues, dated January 30, 2008; U.S. Department of State, Country \nSpecific Information, Nigeria, dated June 2, 2008; and U.S. Diplomatic Mission to Nigeria, Warden \nMessage, Attention all American Citizens, June 26, 2008. The Government\u2019s summary of these \ndocuments is marked HE 1.   \n\n \n5 \n \n \nThe Nigerian government\u2019s human rights record is poor, and the \ngovernment continues to commit serious human rights abuses.  The State \nDepartment\u2019s Report on Human Rights Practices notes that Nigerian \ngovernment officials at all levels committed serious abuses, including: \npolitically motivated and extrajudicial killings by security forces, torture, \narbitrary arrest, and judicial corruption. Police raid homes without \nwarrants.  U.S. citizens have experienced harassment and shakedowns at \ncheckpoints and during encounters with Nigerian officials.   \n \nThe lack of law and order in Nigeria poses considerable risks to travelers, \nincluding the risk of armed robbery or kidnapping. Violent crime, \ncommitted by ordinary criminals, as well as by persons in police and \nmilitary uniforms, can occur throughout the country.  The U.S. Department \nof State warns U.S. citizens of the dangers of travel to Nigeria and of \ncontinued deteriorations of the security situation in the oil rich Niger Delta \nregion in the south western part of the country. Kidnapping for ransom of \npersons associated with the petroleum section, including U.S. citizens, \nremains common in the Niger Delta area.  The U.S. Embassy in Nigeria \nhas issued a warning to American citizens that there is a risk that Niger \nDelta militants could escalate their activities and target expatriate \npersonnel, Western businesses, and facilities and locales visited by \ntourists and foreigners in other regions of Nigeria. U.S. citizens and other \nexpatriates \nhave \nexperienced \nharassment \nand \nshakedowns \nat \ncheckpoints and during encounters with Nigerian officials. \n   \nPolicies \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the  \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, the administrative judge applies these guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \nover-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of \nvariables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \n\n \n6 \n \n \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \n \n \nUnder Guideline B, Foreign Influence, \u201c[f]oreign contacts and interests may be a \nsecurity concern if the individual has divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may \nbe manipulated or induced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government \nin a way that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by any \nforeign interest.\u201d  AG \u00b66. \n \n \nAdditionally, adjudications under Guideline B \u201ccan and should consider the \nidentity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or financial interest is located, \nincluding, but not limited to, such considerations as whether the foreign country is \nknown to target U.S. citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with \nthe risk of terrorism.\u201d  AG \u00b66. \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \n                                           \n \nI have considered all of the disqualifying conditions under the Foreign Influence \nguideline.  The following facts raise security concerns under disqualifying conditions AG \n\u00b6\u00b6 7(a), 7(b), and 7(e):2  \n \n \nNigeria is a country subject to turmoil and poverty, without the benefit of a stable \nlawful government, a situation that threatens U.S. security interests.  American citizens \nwith immediate family members who are citizens or residents of Nigeria could be \nvulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or pressure. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s sister and aunt are citizens and residents of Nigeria.3 Additionally, \nApplicant has eleven nieces and nephews who are citizens and residents of Nigeria. He \ntraveled to Nigeria to visit these and other Nigerian relatives in 2003, 2004, 2005, and \n2006. \n \nApplicant feels a special moral obligation to eight of his nieces and nephews who \nare the children of his deceased sister, who helped to raise him.  He has sent these \nyoung people unspecified amounts of money to aid in their support, and he \ncommunicates by telephone with some of his nephews once or twice a month.   \n \nIn 1990, he opened a bank account at a bank in Nigeria.  In 2004, he purchased, \nfor approximately $10,000, two plots of land in Nigeria for the benefit of his nephews, \nand he, with his brother, he contributed approximately $15,000 to pay for building an \nancestral home in Nigeria. Applicant\u2019s foreign contacts and interests raise security \nconcerns under the foreign influence adjudicative guideline. \n \nSeveral mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 8 might be applicable to Applicant\u2019s \ncase.  If \u201cthe nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which these \npersons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in that country are \nsuch that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a position of having to choose \nbetween the interests of a foreign individual, group, organization, or government and the \ninterests of the U.S.,\u201d then AG \u00b6 8(a) might apply.  If \u201cthere is no conflict of interest, \neither because the individual\u2019s sense of loyalty or obligation to the foreign person, \ngroup, government, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected \nto resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest,\u201d then AG \u00b6 8(b) might \napply.  If \u201ccontact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and infrequent that \n \n2 AG \u00b6 7(a) reads: \u201ccontact with a foreign family member, business or professional associate, friend, or \nother person who is a citizen of or resident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion.\u201d  AG \u00b6 7(b) reads: \u201cconnections to a \nforeign person, group, government, or country that create a potential conflict of interest between the \nindividual\u2019s obligation to protect sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s desire to help a \nforeign person, group, or country by providing that information.\u201d  AG \u00b6 7(e) reads: \u201ca substantial business, \nfinancial, or property interest in a foreign country, or in any foreign-owned or foreign-operated business, \nwhich could subject the individual to heightened risk of foreign influence or exploitation.\u201d \n3 SOR \u00b6 1.e. alleges that Applicant\u2019s \u201cuncle and aunt are citizens of and reside in Nigeria.\u201d Applicant\u2019s \nuncle is deceased. The language in the allegation relative to Applicant\u2019s uncle is concluded for Applicant.  \n\n \n8 \n \n \nthere is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign influence or exploitation,\u201d \nthen AG \u00b6 8(c) might apply.  If \u201cthe value or routine nature of the foreign business, \nfinancial, or property interest is such that they are unlikely to result in a conflict and \ncould not be used effectively to influence, manipulate, or pressure the individual,\u201d then \nAG \u00b6 8(f) might apply. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s relationship with Nigerian family members is strong and charged with \nemotion.  He feels a moral obligation to care for and provide support to the eight \nchildren of his sister, now deceased, who cared for him after he was orphaned by the \ndeaths of his parents. These children are now young adults.  Applicant has provided \nthem with support and he has purchased land for their use in Nigeria.  His relationship \nwith his Nigerian relatives is avuncular and based on long-standing family ties of \naffection and obligation.  Applicant is a dutiful brother, uncle, and nephew who looks \nafter the welfare of his many family members in Nigeria. He maintains frequent \ntelephone contact with some of his nephews and speaks with them once or twice a \nmonth. Applicant\u2019s relatives\u2019 citizenship and residency in Nigeria create a heightened \nrisk that he could be targeted for exploitation, pressure, or coercion by individuals or \ngroups operating outside of the law in Nigeria. These groups might also threaten U.S. \nsecurity interests. Applicant failed to provide sufficient information to rebut or mitigate \nthese security concerns. I conclude that the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6\u00b6 8(a), \n8(b), and 8(c) are inapplicable. \n \n \nApplicant testified that his bank account in Nigeria, which he opened in 1990 with \na deposit of $40 and had never used, was defunct.  He provided documentation at his \nhearing showing that he had sold his interest in the two lots in Nigeria to his brother for \n$10,000.  I found Applicant\u2019s testimony about his bank account in Nigeria to be credible. \nHowever, I found that Applicant\u2019s assertion that he no longer had an interest in the two \nlots to lack credibility. By selling the lots to his brother on the day before his hearing, \nApplicant had not divested himself of the land in an arm\u2019s length transaction. His \nassertions that he no longer held a redeemable interest in the land were not persuasive. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s financial interest in the land in Nigeria was not substantial.  However, \nhis property interest in the two lots in Nigeria was not routine. He had acquired and held \nthe land for the use of his nephews. His desire to assist his nephews in this way arose \nfrom a sense of moral obligation to them in return for their mother\u2019s care of him when he \nwas orphaned as a child. It was not clear whether the nephews knew of his intention to \nhold the land for their interest and use.  His assignment of the land would appear to run \ncontrary to his intent to carry out a perceived moral duty to his nephews and poses a \npotential for conflict that could be used to influence, manipulate, or pressure him.  I \nconclude that AG \u00b6 8(d) does not apply to the facts of Applicant\u2019s case.   \n \n \nNothing in Applicant\u2019s answers to the Guideline B allegations in the SOR \nsuggested he was not a loyal U.S. citizen. Section 7 of Executive Order 10865 \nspecifically provides that industrial security clearance decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d   \n\n \n9 \n \n \nGuideline C, Foreign Preference \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 9, the security concern involving foreign preference arises \u201c[w]hen \nan individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a foreign country over \nthe United States.\u201d  Such an individual \u201cmay be prone to provide information or make \ndecisions that are harmful to the interests of the United States.\u201d \n \nAG \u00b6 10 describes several conditions that could raise a security concern and \nmay be disqualifying.  These disqualifying conditions are as follows: \n \n(a) exercise of any right, privilege or obligation of foreign citizenship after \nbecoming a U.S. citizen or through the foreign citizenship of a family \nmember.  This includes but is not limited to: \n \n(1) possession of a current foreign passport; \n \n(2) military service or a willingness to bear arms for a foreign \ncountry; \n \n(3) accepting educational, medical, retirement, social welfare, or \nother such benefits from a foreign country; \n \n(4) residence in a foreign country to meet citizenship requirements; \n \n(5) using foreign citizenship to protect financial or business \ninterests in another country; \n \n(6) seeking or holding political office in a foreign country; and \n \n(7) voting in a foreign election; \n \n(b) action to acquire or obtain recognition of a foreign citizenship by an \nAmerican citizen; \n \n(c) performing or attempting to perform duties, or otherwise acting, so as \nto serve the interests of a foreign person, group, organization, or \ngovernment in conflict with the national security interest; and  \n \n(d) any statement or action that shows allegiance to a country other than \nthe United States: for example, declaration of intent to renounce United \nStates citizenship; renunciation of United States citizenship. \n \n \nBefore becoming a U.S. citizen, Applicant held a Nigerian passport. After \nbecoming a U.S. citizen in 2000, Applicant acquired a U.S. passport. In 2005, he \nrenewed his Nigerian passport. His Nigerian passport was scheduled to expire in \nNovember 2010.  \n\n \n10 \n \n \n \nApplicant used his Nigerian passport to enter and exit Nigeria in 2003, 2004, \n2005, and 2006. Applicant\u2019s acquisition of a Nigerian passport after becoming a U.S. \ncitizen raises a concern that he actively exercised dual citizenship with Nigeria. These \nactions showed an allegiance to a country other than the U.S. \n \nI have carefully reviewed the facts of Applicant\u2019s case and the Foreign \nPreference AG. I conclude that Applicant\u2019s conduct raises potentially disqualifying \nsecurity concerns under AG \u00b610 (a)(1). \n \nUnder AG \u00b611(a), dual citizenship might be mitigated if it is based solely on an \napplicant\u2019s parents\u2019 citizenship or birth in a foreign country.  Under AG \u00b6 11(b), an \nindividual\u2019s dual citizenship might be mitigated if he or she has expressed a willingness \nto renounce dual citizenship.  Under AG \u00b611(c), an individual\u2019s exercise of the rights, \nprivileges, or obligations of foreign citizenship might be mitigated if it occurred before \nbecoming a U.S. citizen or when the individual was a minor.  Under AG \u00b611(d), an \nindividual\u2019s use of a foreign passport might be mitigated if it were approved by his \ncognizant security authority.  Under AG \u00b6 11(e), an individual\u2019s use of a foreign passport \nmight be mitigated if he presented credible evidence that the passport had been \ndestroyed, surrendered to the cognizant security authority, or otherwise invalidated. \n \nAt his hearing, Applicant provided documentation to corroborate his assertion \nthat he had surrendered his active Nigerian passport to a responsible official at the \nNigerian embassy. He also confirmed his allegiance to the United States.  Thus, AG \u00b6 \n11(e) applies in mitigation.  I conclude that the other remaining mitigating conditions are \ninapplicable. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and \nother permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n\n \n11 \n \n \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of the \nwhole person concept and all the facts and circumstances surrounding this case. \nApplicant is an adult of 44 years of age. He is deeply grateful to his aunts, uncles, and \nsister who provided him with a home when he was orphaned as a young child. He feels \nmorally obligated to the children of the sister, now deceased, who helped to raise him. \nHe has attempted to repay the obligation he feels to his sister by sending money to her \nchildren and by purchasing land in Nigeria for their use. His deep sense of obligation \nsuggests he may also be vulnerable to exploitation or manipulation. \n \n Nigeria is a country split by ethnic and religious division and handicapped by \npoverty, widespread corruption, and lawlessness. U.S. citizens who travel to Nigeria on \nbusiness or as tourists have been advised that militants may target them. U.S. citizens \ntraveling to Nigeria have also been harassed by Nigerian officials. Under these \ncircumstances, Applicant\u2019s willingness to provide support to his Nigerian nieces and \nnephews and his sense of obligation, while honorable, also expose him to the possibility \nof pressure and inducement, His sense of obligation and desire to help his Nigerian \nrelatives could make him vulnerable to exploitation and create a conflict of interest with \nhis obligation to protect classified information.  \n \n Overall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For these reasons, I \nconclude that while Applicant mitigated security concerns arising under the foreign \npreference adjudicative guideline, he failed to mitigate security concerns arising under \nthe foreign interest adjudicative guideline.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B  \n \nAGAINST  APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.e:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.f:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n\n \n12 \n \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline C:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.b:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

She has\nestablished a pattern of criminal charges over a 15-year period, and she currently is on probation.\nShe falsified answers on a security clearance application.  She has a history of unpaid debts.  She did\nnot successfully mitigate the security concerns about criminal conduct, personal conduct, and\nfinancial considerations.  Clearance is denied.\n\nGovernment Exhibit 1 (Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Proceedings (e-QIP), dated October 18, 2005).\n1\nTr. at 15-16.\n2\nId. at 15-17, 23.\n3\n2\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn October 18, 2005, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations\nProceedings (e-QIP) (SF 86).   The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to\n1\ngrant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.  As required by Executive Order 10865,\nSafeguarding Classified Information Within Industry, dated February 20, 1960, as amended, and\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended, DOHA issued a Statement of Reasons\n(SOR) on July 5, 2007, detailing the basis for its decision \u2013 security concerns raised under Guideline\nJ (Criminal Conduct), Guideline E (Personal Conduct), and Guideline F (Financial Considerations)\nof the Directive.  The President issued revised adjudicative guidelines (Guidelines) on December 30,\n2005.  DoD implemented them on September 1, 2006.  Pending official amendment/reissue of DoD\nDirective 5220.6, the Guidelines are to be used in all cases when the SOR is dated on or after\nSeptember 1, 2006.  Because the SOR was issued after September 1, 2006, DoD policy requires that\nthis case proceed under the revised guidelines. \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on August 8, 2007, and elected to have a hearing\nbefore an administrative judge.  DOHA assigned the case to me on September 6, 2007, and issued\na Notice of Hearing on September 11, 2007.  I convened a hearing on October 10, 2007, to consider\nwhether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant's  security\nclearance.  The government offered eleven exhibits, marked as Exhibits 1-11.  Applicant offered\neight exhibits, marked as Exhibits A-H.  All exhibits were admitted without objection.  I kept the\nrecord open until October 19, 2007, to give Applicant the time to file additional documents.  On\nOctober 17, 2007, she filed four documents that were marked as Applicant\u2019s Exhibits I, J, K, and L.\nThe government had no objection and the exhibits were admitted.  DOHA received the transcript\n(Tr.) on October 18, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant admitted all of the allegations contained in the SOR except subparagraphs 2.b. and\nc., and 3.b., c., and f.  The admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact.  After a complete\nand thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of same, I make the\nfollowing additional findings of fact: \nApplicant is a 46-year-old security receptionist employed by a federal contractor.

The charge was nolle\nprosequi.  \nIn March 1996, Applicant stole a clock from a department store and was charged with (1)\ntheft less than $300 and (2) battery.  She was found guilty of Count 1 and sentenced to 30 days in\njail (25 days suspended), placed on probation, and required to pay court costs.  Count 2 was nolle\nprosequi.\nIn May 1997 and March 2001, Applicant was charged as a fugitive from justice by a\nmunicipal police department, for failure to pay restitution.4\nApplicant was charged with petty larceny in February 1999, after stealing merchandise from\na department store.5\nOn August 21, 2005, Applicant was charged with three counts of assault in the second\ndegree, and one count of disorderly conduct, after she was involved in a fight outside a bar.   On\n6\nJanuary 20 6, 2006, the assault charges were nolle prosequi, she pled guilty to the disorderly conduct\ncharge, and she was given probation before judgment.  She will remain on probation until January\n2009.7\nPersonal Conduct\nAs of October 2005, Applicant resided with a person who had been charged with and/or\nconvicted of several drug related offenses.8\nOn a Questionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86), executed by Applicant on\nOctober 18, 2005, she was asked to disclose any pending criminal charges against her, except certain\nconvictions expunged under the Federal Controlled Substances Act  (Question 23c).  She failed to\n9\nlist the charges filed on August 21, 2005, supra.  She explained that although she had been charged,\nshe had not gone to court and therefore, she thought she did not have to list the charges.10\nOn the same questionnaire, Question 23f, Applicant was asked to list any arrests, charges,\nor convictions, for offenses not listed in response to Question 23 sections a, b, c, d, or e, except\ntraffic fines of less than $150 unless the violation was alcohol or drug related, and the same\nexception for certain convictions under the Federal Controlled Substances Act.

He is nine years old and has lived with\n17\nher for five months.   She borrowed $2,500 at the time he moved in with her.  She has not sought\n18\n19\nadvice from a credit counselor.20\nPOLICIES\nIn an evaluation of an applicant\u2019s security suitability, an administrative judge must consider\nthe \u201cAdjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility For Access to Classified Information\u201d\n(Guidelines).  In addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative\nguidelines are divided into Disqualifying Conditions (DC) and Mitigating Conditions (MC), which\nare used to determine an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible ironclad rules of law.  Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed\nin the adjudicative process.  An administrative judge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair,\n21\nimpartial and common sense decision.  Because the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a\nnumber of variables known as the \u201cwhole person concept,\u201d an administrative judge considers all\navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.22\nSpecifically, an administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors\nlisted at Guideline \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency\nand recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5)\nextent to which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d\nSince the protection of the national security is the paramount consideration, the final decision\nin each case is arrived at by applying the standard that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being\nconsidered for access to classified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d   In\n23\nreaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based\n\n\u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion\n24\nin light of all the contrary evidence in the record.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing\nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.32.1).  \u201cThis is something less than the weight of the evidence, and the possibility of drawing two\ninconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent [a Judge\u2019s] finding from being supported by substantial\nevidence.\u201d Consolo v. Federal Maritime Comm\u2019n, 383 U.S. 607, 620 (1966).  \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a\nscintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4  Cir. 1994).\nth\nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.15. \n25\nSee ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005) \u201cThe Administrative Judge considers the record evidence\n26\n.  \nas a whole, both favorable and unfavorable, evaluates Applicant\u2019s past and current circumstances in light of the\nprovisions of the Directive, and decide[s] whether Applicant has met his burden of persuasion under Directive \u00b6\nE3.1.15.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 04-10340 at 2 (App. Bd. July 6, 2006).\nExecutive Order 10865, \u00a7 7.\n27\n6\non the evidence contained in the record.  Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on\nmere speculation or conjecture.\nIn the decision-making process, facts must be established by \u201csubstantial evidence.\u201d   The\n24\nGovernment initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish a case which demonstrates,\nin accordance with the Directive, that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant\nor continue an applicant\u2019s access to classified information.  Once the Government has produced\nsubstantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, the burden shifts to Applicant to present \u201cwitnesses\nand other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by\nDepartment Counsel, and [applicant] has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a\nfavorable clearance decision.\u201d   The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the\n25\nGovernment.26\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with\nthe Government predicated upon trust and confidence.  This relationship transcends normal duty\nhours and endures throughout off-duty hours.  The Government reposes a high degree of trust and\nconfidence in individuals to whom it grants access to classified information.  Decisions under this\nDirective include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk an applicant may deliberately or\ninadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified information.  Such decisions entail a certain\ndegree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nThe scope of an administrative judge\u2019s decision is limited.  Nothing in this Decision should\nbe construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole or in part, on any express or implied\ndetermination as to Applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or patriotism.27\nCONCLUSIONS\nGuideline J\u2014Criminal Conduct\n\n7\nGuidelines \u00b6 30. The Concern. Criminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment,\nreliability, and trustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person's ability or\nwillingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations.\nGuidelines \u00b6 31. Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying\ninclude:\n(a) a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses;\n \n(c) allegation or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was formally\ncharged, formally prosecuted or convicted; and\n(d) individual is currently on parole or probation.\nThe government established its case under Guidelines \u00b631 (a), (c), and (d).  Applicant was\ncharged, fined, or placed on probation for four crimes.  She additionally was served a bench warrant\ntwo separate times for failure to pay restitution in a city case.  She admitted the arrests and charges,\nand she is currently on probation until January 2009, for a conviction in January 2006.\nGuidelines \u00b6 32. Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include:\n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it happened under such\nunusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's\nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;\n(b) the person was pressured or coerced into committing the act and those pressures are no longer\npresent in the person's life;\n(c) evidence that the person did not commit the offense; and\n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited to the passage of time\nwithout recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or restitution, job training or higher education, good\nemployment record, or constructive community involvement.\nAfter reviewing the mitigating conditions, I conclude that Guidelines \u00b6 32 (a-c) do not apply.\nThe criminal activity is recent - January 2006 - and Applicant is still on probation.  She admitted the\ncrimes and charges.  Because she is still on probation, Guidelines \u00b6 32 (d) cannot apply because the\nprobation runs until January 2009, insufficient time has elapsed since the conduct occurred (August\n2005), and she has pattern of conduct that covers a 15-year period.  I conclude Guideline J against\nApplicant.\nGuideline E\u2014Personal Conduct\nGuidelines \u00b6 15. The Concern. Conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor,\ndishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions about an\nindividual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information.  Of special\n\n8\ninterest is any failure to provide truthful and candid answers during the security clearance process\nor any other failure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\nThe following will normally result in an unfavorable clearance action or administrative termination\nof further processing for clearance eligibility:\n(a) refusal, or failure without reasonable cause, to undergo or cooperate with security processing,\nincluding but not limited to meeting with a security investigator for subject interview, completing\nsecurity forms or releases, and cooperation with medical or psychological evaluation;\n(b) refusal to provide full, frank and truthful answers to lawful questions of investigators, security\nofficials, or other official representatives in connection with a personnel security or trustworthiness\ndetermination.\nGuidelines \u00b6 16. Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying\ninclude:\n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any personnel security\nquestionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine\nemployment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or\ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities;\n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is not sufficient for an\nadverse determination under any other single guideline, but which, when considered as a whole,\nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack\nof candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that\nthe person may not properly safeguard protected information; and\n(g) association with persons involved in criminal activity. \nThe government established its case under Guideline E.  Applicant\u2019s reasons for falsifying\nanswers to two questions on her security clearance application were that she did not think she had\nto list the charges that were filed because she had not gone to court, and that \u201cmaybe it slipped my\nmind.\u201d  The first answer is not credible because she had enough prior experience with the criminal\njustice system to know the difference between charges, convictions, probation, and nolle prosequi.\nShe knew she had been charged with petty larceny in 1999, and that she had been listed as a fugitive\nfrom justice in a municipal court for failing to make court-ordered restitution.\nGuidelines \u00b6 17. Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include:\n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, concealment, or\nfalsification before being confronted with the facts;\n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was caused or significantly\ncontributed to by improper or inadequate advice of authorized personnel or legal counsel advising\nor instructing the individual specifically concerning the security clearance process.  Upon being\n\n9\nmade aware of the requirement to cooperate or provide the information, the individual cooperated\nfully and truthfully;\n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is so infrequent, or it\nhappened under such unique circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the\nindividual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;\n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling to change the behavior\nor taken other positive steps to alleviate the stressors, circumstances, or factors that caused\nuntrustworthy, unreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur;\n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability to exploitation,\nmanipulation, or duress;\n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable reliability; and\n(g) association with persons involved in criminal activity has ceased or occurs under circumstances\nthat do not cast doubt upon the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, judgment, or willingness to\ncomply with rules and regulations.\nAfter considering the testimony and evidence, I do not find any mitigating conditions that are\napplicable.  Applicant did not come forward to correct the omissions.  She was not given incorrect\nadvice about the application.  Her conduct does raise doubts about her trustworthiness and good\njudgment.  Moreover, she has not sought counseling.  However, she has a history of law violations\nand has not taken steps to reduce vulnerability to coercion.  The information was substantiated.  And\nshe has lived with a person involved in drug trafficking.  In totality she has not mitigated the security\nconcerns regarding personal conduct.  \nGuideline F\u2014Financial Considerations\nGuidelines \u00b6 18. The Concern. Failure or inability to live within one's means, satisfy debts,\nand meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to\nabide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual's reliability,\ntrustworthiness and ability to protect classified information.  An individual who is financially\noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. Compulsive gambling\nis a concern as it may lead to financial crimes including espionage.  Affluence that cannot be\nexplained by known sources of income is also a security concern.  It may indicate proceeds from\nfinancially profitable criminal acts.\nGuidelines \u00b6 19. Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying\ninclude:\n(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and\n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.\n\nDirective \u00b6 E.2.2.1.\n28\n10\nThe government established it case under Guidelines \u00b6 19 (a) and (c).  Applicant has a history\nof unpaid debts and not meeting financial obligations.  In examining the evidence, I find that she\npaid the debt listed in SOR subparagraph 3.b., the debt cited at 3.c. is nearly paid, and she established\na payment plan by stipulation to commence November 6, 2007 for the debt in 3.j.  The others remain\nunpaid and total about $5,800.\nGuidelines \u00b6 20.  Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include:\n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that\nit is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness,\nor good judgment;\n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person's control\n(e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce\nor separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;\n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear\nindications that the problem is being resolved or is under control;\n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts;\n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-due debt which is the\ncause of the problem and provides documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or\nprovides evidence of actions to resolve the issue; and\n(f) the affluence resulted from a legal source of income.\nThe only potential mitigating condition is the expense of caring for her grand-child.  The\ngrand-child has only been living with her for five months so this is not a contributing factor to her\nindebtedness. She has just started payment plans with one creditor, and has done nothing with at\nleast six creditors.  She did not seek financial counseling.  There is an insufficient amount of time\npast to establish a track record of successful debt resolution.  I conclude Guideline F against\nApplicant.\nWhole Person Analysis\n\u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make\nan affirmative determination that the person is eligible for a security clearance.\u201d   \u201cAvailable,\n28\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be\n\nId.\n29\nId.\n30\n11\nconsidered in reaching a determination.\u201d   In addition to the disqualifying and mitigating conditions,\n29\nI also considered the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept in evaluating Applicant\u2019s risk and vulnerability in\nprotecting our national interests.   I considered her age (46), her employment, and what might cause\n30\nher to periodically break the law and be in continual financial distress.  She has had a  history of\nfinancial delinquencies, including charge-offs and collections,  and she failed to present any evidence\nshowing why she incurred delinquent debts between 2004 and 2006 that remain unpaid.  The record\ncontains insufficient evidence to make a determination of why she is indebted and to find any\nmitigating condition applicable.  The underlying reasons for her delinquent obligations can only be\nconjecture. \nApplicant\u2019s criminal conduct establishes a pattern over a 15-year period.  She is still on\nprobation.  Her association with a known drug dealer is problematic.  She also supplied false answers\non a security clearance application.  This is a concern because candor with the government about a\nperson\u2019s negatives is the crux of a trustworthiness determination.  If a person discloses the adverse\ninformation about herself, then she may be trusted with confidential or classified information.\nAlthough not alleged in the SOR, these false statements are separate violations of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001.\nThe totality of the record raises reasonable and persistent doubts about Applicant's ability to protect\nclassified information and to exercise the requisite good judgment and discretion expected of one\nin whom the government entrusts its interests.  I conclude it is not clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant or continue Applicant=s security clearance.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required\nby E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1.

ABLARD\nAPPEARANCES\nFOR GOVERNMENT\nEric H. Borgstrom, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\n\n2\nSYNOPSIS\nApplicant, a 26-year-old engineer with a major defense contractor, emigrated at age 14 to the\nU.S. from the Peoples Republic of China to join his mother who had come to the U.S. two years\nearlier. He was educated in a U.S. high school and university and has held an interim security\nclearance without incident for the past two years. He mitigated security concerns arising from his\nties to his father and paternal grandparents, who are citizens of and residing in the Peoples Republic\nof China. He has long connections with the U.S., has fully complied with all security requirements\nduring the two years he has held a clearance, and knows security requirements. Although he has\ntraveled to the PRC three times in the past ten years to visit family, he has not done so since joining\nhis company and does not intend to do so again. Clearance is granted.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn March 9, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) pursuant to\nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry as amended and\nmodified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended and modified, issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the\npreliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. DOHA recommended the case be\nreferred to an administrative judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued,\ndenied, or revoked.\nIn a sworn written statement, dated March 26, 2007, Applicant responded to the allegations\nset forth in the SOR, and requested a hearing. The case was assigned to me on June 6, 2007. A\nNotice of Hearing was issued June 7, 2007, for a hearing held on June 27, 2007. The Government\nintroduced three exhibits at the hearing and requested that administrative notice be taken of 15\nofficial government documents. The Applicant introduced seven exhibits. All exhibits were admitted\ninto evidence and notice was taken of facts identified in the administrative notice request. The\nApplicant testified on his own behalf. The transcript was received on July 18, 2007. \nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant admitted all allegations under Foreign Influence (Guideline B) except for an\nallegation regarding his mother\u2019s citizenship. The admissions are incorporated herein as findings of\nfact. After a complete review of the evidence in the record and upon due consideration of the record\nthe following additional findings of fact are made:\nApplicant is a-26-year-old employee of a major defense contractor working as a software\ndeveloper since April 2005. He emigrated to the U.S. from the Peoples Republic of China (PRC) in\n1995 when he was 14 years old to join his mother who had immigrated in 1992. His parents were\ndivorced in the PRC in 1988. He had been raised by his maternal grandparents most of his young life\nas his mother worked. After the divorce his father obtained custody as required by Chinese law. He\nwas then raised by the paternal grandparents for several years during which time he had little contact\nwith his father (Tr. 51). \n\n3\nApplicant\u2019s mother wanted to bring him to the U.S. for his education when she emigrated\nbut his father would not agree until three years later. When he came he and his mother lived with an\naunt who had emigrated earlier. He has lived all 12 of his years since reaching maturity in the U.S.\nHe is a graduate of a public high school and a leading engineering school in electrical engineering.\nWhile attending college he worked either full time or part time in information technology for several\ncompanies. He is now enrolled in a master\u2019s degree program in computer science. His employer\nhired him after reviewing his impressive resume on the internet. \nApplicant became a U.S. citizen in 2004. His mother became a U.S. citizen in 2006. She\nlives in the U.S. (Exh. C), and is married to a U.S. citizen. He visits her at least once a year. Her\nhusband works for an automobile manufacturing company. She is employed as an accountant which\nwas her work in the PRC. His maternal grandmother is in the U.S. as a permanent resident although\nstill a citizen of the PRC. Her husband was in the Red Army during the revolution and is deceased.\nHis grandmother, mother, several of her sisters and their families all live in the same U.S. city.\nApplicant\u2019s father still lives in the PRC. He is a retired a factory worker and now works part-\ntime as a musician on a radio station in the far northeastern part of the PRC. He last saw his father\nin 2004 and 2005 when he visited in the PRC. Over the past ten years he has had fewer contacts with\nhim. His father was never in the PRC military but is a member of the communist party, the only party\nin the PRC. He telephones them 3-4 times a year using a phone card. He told his father the name of\nthe company for which he works and that he is working to support U.S. Government programs but\nhe asked no questions about it (Tr. 48). \nApplicant\u2019s paternal grandparents also live in the PRC in the same area of the country as the\nfather. They are retired from a family business. His grandmother is a lawyer. Both are members of\nthe communist party. His grandfather was in the Red Army during the civil war and spent five years\nin a re-education camp during the cultural revolution. When he was released he ran a community\nhealth center. They receive a government pension. Applicant telephones them twice a year using a\nphone card, so they do know his phone number or his address. They may have been told by his father\nthe name of the company for which Applicant works but they have never inquired (Tr. 18). \nApplicant\u2019s aunt also lives in the PRC. She is a nurse, and he has had limited contact with\nher during his trips. In 1995 and 1997 when he was visiting he got a ride from the airport with her.\nHe has had no contact with her since then.\nApplicant has a girl friend from South Korea whom he met in 2005. When he became\nfriendly with her, he advised his security office within a week of initiating the friendship (Tr. 46).\nHe visited her and her family in South Korea in 2006. She graduated from a major east coast state\nuniversity in 2007 and is now working for a Korean bank in New York. She plans to resign to attend\ngraduate school. She does not intend to become a U.S. citizen. \nApplicant made three trips to the PRC in summers of 1997 and 1999, and in February 2005\n(Exh. 1). The last trip was with a U.S. passport and first two were using a PRC passport which he\ndestroyed when he became a U.S. citizen (Exh. G and Tr. 22 and 64). He was not employed in the\ndefense industry when he made those trips. He was employed when he went to South Korea in 2006\n\n4\nand did report the trip to his company security office both before and after he returned from the trip.\nBefore leaving he was given a security briefing on South Korea and his security obligations while\ntraveling overseas. He has no future plans to visit the PRC or South Korea. Now that he works in\nthe U.S. defense industry he has no plans to see his relatives in the PRC. He is closer to his numerous\nfamily members who are all in the U.S. and they are the only family that he has a continuing desire\nto see (Tr. 49).\nApplicant has held an interim security clearance since December 2005 when he was first\nemployed by his company. He has had no security violations. Applicant has been briefed on security\nrequirements by his company (Tr. 77). He follows the rules on all company requirements including\nthose relating to security (Exh. A). He knows the proper procedures for reporting matters of security\nconcern to the cognizant security officials (Tr. 78). He has a keen interest in preserving U.S.\ntechnology.\nApplicant is highly regarded by his program manager and government team leader as an\noutstanding worker whose honesty and candor is beyond reproach. He is deemed to be the \u201ctop\nperformer on the team\u201d and \u201ccompletely honest\u201d (Exhs. A and B).\nApplicant\u2019s salary is $65,000 per annum. It was raised from $54,000 after evaluations during\nthe two years of his employment. He owns no property except an automobile. He lives in a rented\nroom in a home having given up an apartment to pay for his continuing education. He has savings\naccounts of approximately $8,000. He neither provides any financial support for his relatives in the\nPRC nor do they provide any funds to him. \nApplicant loves his work, and is very proud of his U.S. citizenship and education. He speaks\nflawless English. He has a strong belief in democracy and will do what he can to support it (Tr. 25).\nHe appreciates the responsibilities and opportunities which he has been given.\nPOLICIES\n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S.\n518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has \u201cthe authority to control access to\ninformation bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently\ntrustworthy to occupy a position that will give that person access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527\nAn evaluation of whether the applicant meets the security guidelines includes consideration of the\nfollowing factors: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances\nsurrounding the conduct; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and\nmaturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the voluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence\nof rehabilitation and other behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential\nfor pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\n(Revised Adjudicative Guideline (AG) \u00b6 2 a)Security clearances are granted only when \u201cit is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Executive Order No. 10865 \u00a7 2. See Executive Order\nNo. 12968 \u00a7 3.1(b).\n\n5\nInitially, the Government must establish, by something less than a preponderance of the\nevidence, that conditions exist in the personal or professional history of the applicant which\ndisqualify, or may disqualify, the applicant from being eligible for access to classified information.\nSee Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. The applicant then bears the burden of demonstrating that it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a clearance. \u201cAny doubt as to whether access\nto classified information is clearly consistent with national security will be resolved in favor of the\nnational security.\u201d (AG \u00b6 2 b) \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the\nside of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. See Executive Order No. 12968 \u00a7 3.1(b).\nCONCLUSION\nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all appropriate legal\nprecepts, factors and conditions above, I conclude the following with respect to all allegations set\nforth in the SOR: \nConditions under Guideline B that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying\ninclude contact with a foreign family member who is a citizen of, or resident in a foreign country if\nthat contact creates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure or\ncoercion (AG \u00b6 7a). Based on the evidence of record, including Applicant\u2019s family members living\nabroad, the Government established a basis for concern over foreign influence. The Applicant has\nthe burden to establish security suitability through evidence which refutes, mitigates, or extenuates\nthe disqualification and demonstrates that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant\na security clearance. ISCR Case No. 99-0424 (App. Bd. Feb. 8, 2001).\nBy virtue of the relationships of the foreign family members, Applicant\u2019s contacts, though\ninfrequent, cannot be deemed casual. The fact that some relatives live in the PRC and the history of\nthat country as to economic and military espionage as well as their membership in the communist\nparty by the three closest relatives makes it a heightened risk. Mitigating conditions (MC) that might\nbe applicable are a determination that the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the\ncountry in which the persons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in that country\nare such that is unlikely the individual will be placed in a position of having to choose between the\ninterests of a foreign individual group or government and the interests of the U.S. (AG \u00b6 8a). The\nother relevant MC is that the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships and loyalties\nin the U.S.,that he can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. (AG \u00b6 8b).\nWhile Applicant\u2019s father and his paternal grandparents live in the PRC, his father is\nemployed in an area totally unrelated to national security and defense. His grandparents are elderly\nand fully retired. They are all members of the communist party but that is the only party permitted\nto exist in the PRC. Thus, because of the closeness in affinity of the relationships, I cannot find that\nany of the particular MC\u2019s under Guideline B are applicable. However, he has minimized the risk\ninvolved in those relationships by lessening the telephone contacts to fewer than 3-4 times a year and\nby using telephone calling cards and not his home phone. \nThe government conceded at the hearing that the allegation in the SOR that Applicant\u2019s\nmother was a citizen of the PRC had been mitigated by proof of her acquiring U.S. citizenship in\n2006. The government also conceded that the concerns relating to the aunt in the PRC and the girl\nfriend were lessened by virtue of minimal contact as to the aunt and the fact that the girl friend was\n\n6\nnot a family member. Thus, the principal concern of the government is the citizenship and residence\nof Applicant\u2019s father and paternal grandparents. \nIn all adjudications the protection of our national security is of paramount concern. Persons\nwho have access to classified information have an overriding responsibility for the security of the\nnation. The objective of the security clearance process is the fair-minded, commonsense assessment\nof a person\u2019s trustworthiness and fitness for access to classified information. The \u201cwhole person\u201d\nconcept recognizes that we should view a person by the totality of their acts and omissions. Each\ncase must be judged on its own merits taking into consideration all relevant circumstances, and\napplying sound judgment, mature thinking, and careful analysis.\nApplicant is a person of substance and veracity who is well educated. He has a responsible\nposition of trust, and he is doing an excellent job for his company. He provided sincere and credible\ntestimony as to his relationship with his family, his motivations, and his loyalty to the U.S. He is still\na young person, but has established a successful life building financial and educational ties to the\nU.S. He has a strong financial stake in the U.S. His contacts with his family living abroad are\nminimal. He has no deference to or loyalty to his country of origin.\nCertainly the PRC is an acknowledged collector of military and defense information and this\nis a matter of concern to the U.S. as illustrated in the documents about which I have taken\nadministrative notice (AN IV, V, and VI). There is also evidence that South Korea is an active\ncollector of information (An XII, and XVI). There is evidence of human rights violations in both\ncountries. Applicant understands this concern and recognizes the responsibility he has to act\nprudently. Thus, he has determined not to travel to the PRC in the future. He has demonstrated his\nability to comply with security requirements as evidenced by the precautions he took in traveling to\nSouth Korea in 2006 and concerning his friendship with a foreign citizen. All of his maternal\nrelatives with whom he is close live in the U.S., and they are his main familial support. He knows\nto well the problems in the PRC as witnessed by his grandfather during the cultural revolution.\nAlthough Applicant is a young man, he made a very solid impression during the hearing in\nthis proceeding as being  mature beyond his years. He has much to offer the U.S. from his education\nand work as illustrated by the confidence expressed in him by his supervisors. He is totally integrated\ninto U.S. society. He expresses himself forthright in the responses given at the hearing in this\nproceeding and candidly discussed his family including those aspects of the family which might not\nbe beneficial to the outcome of this proceeding.  \nAfter considering all the evidence in its totality and as an integrated whole to focus on the\nwhole person of Applicant, I conclude that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant\nclearance to Applicant. Clearance is granted. \nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal Findings as required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive are hereby\nrendered as follows:\nParagraph l Guideline B: \nFOR APPLICANT\n\n7\nSubparagraph 1.a.:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b.:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c.:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e.:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f.:\nFor Applicant\nDECISION\nAfter full consideration of all the facts and documents presented by the record in this case,\nit is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for\nApplicant.

MOGUL\nAPPEARANCES\nFOR GOVERNMENT\nJennifer I. Goldstein, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\n\n2\nSYNOPSIS\nApplicant is a 33 year-old naturalized United States citizen, born in the People\u2019s Republic\nof China (PRC), then living with her family in Hong Kong and moving to the U.S. in 1991.\nApplicant\u2019s parents and two brothers are citizens of the People\u2019s Republic of China  (PRC) residing\nin Hong Kong. None of these family members belong to, participate in, or are active with any\ngovernment agency of the PRC or Hong Kong.  Applicant\u2019s strong attachment to the United States\nand minimal ties to Hong Kong and the PRC makes it unlikely that she would respond favorably to\nany efforts to persuade her to act against United States interests. Mitigation has been shown.\nClearance is granted.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn March 7, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to\nExecutive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2,\n1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant which detailed reasons why DOHA could\nnot make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant and recommended referral\nto an Administrative Judge to determine whether clearance should be denied or revoked.\nApplicant responded to the SOR in writing on April 26, 2007. Applicant requested a\nclearance decision based on a hearing record.\nThe case was initially assigned to another Administrative Judge to conduct a hearing and\nissue a written decision on June 14, 2007,  but the case was reassigned to this Administrative Judge\non June 18, 2007. A Notice of Hearing was issued to the parties on August 6, 2007, and the hearing\nwas held on August 24, 2007.\nAt the hearing, Department Counsel offered three documentary exhibits (Exhibits 1through\n3) and no witnesses were called. Applicant offered 20 documentary exhibits (Exhibits A - T) and\noffered her own testimony and that of her husband. The record was left open until September 7,\n2007, to allow Applicant and Department Counsel to offer additional documentation regarding\ncertain issues of the PRC. Applicant offered a memorandum with nine attachments which has been\nidentified collectively as Exhibit U, and Department Counsel offered a cover letter and two\ndocuments, which have been identified collectively as Exhibit 4.  Both were submitted in a timely\nmanner. I have entered Exhibit 4 for the Government and Exhibit U for Applicant.  The transcript\n(Tr) was received on September 10, 2007. \nFINDINGS OF FACT\nIn the SOR, the Government alleges that a security risk may exist under Adjudicative\nGuideline B and Guideline C of the Directive. The SOR contains two allegations, 1.a. and 1.b., under\nGuideline B, and one allegation, 2.a., under Guideline C. Applicant admitted SOR allegation 2.a.,\nand she denied 1.a. and 1.b. The admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. \n\n3\nAfter a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, including Applicant's\nAnswer to the SOR, the documents and the live testimony, and upon due consideration of that\nevidence, I make the additional findings of fact: \nApplicant is 33 years old,  employed as a Software Engineer by a defense contractor, and she\nseeks a security clearance for that position.  She received a Bachelor of Science degree in Computer\nScience in 1995, and a Master\u2019s Degree in Math in 1997,  both from a United States university. \nApplicant  was born in the PRC in 1973, and she and her family moved to Hong Kong in\n1986.  In 1991, at the age of 18, she moved to the United States to finish high school and eventually\nget her advanced college degrees, and she has lived here continuously since 1991.\nApplicant\u2019s husband is a United States citizen by birth, who is currently serving as an active\nduty Major in the U.S. Air Force. They have been married for almost eight years, and she and her\nhusband have twin daughters, born in 2004, who are natural born United States citizens.\nApplicant  became a naturalized U.S. citizen in January  2006. She introduced Exhibit L to\nexplain why it took her so long to be eligible to become a U.S. citizen.  The primary difficulty was\nbecause she had to move each time her husband received transfer orders, and thus she was placed\nat the back of another waiting line. She applied for U.S. citizenship as soon as she was able. \nParagraph 1 (Guideline B - Foreign Influence) \n1.a. Applicant's father and mother are citizens of the PRC, and  they reside in Hong Kong.\nApplicant's father, 58 years old, is a physician employed by a hospital in Hong Kong and her mother,\n60,  is a retired physician.  Applicant describes her contact with her parents as casual, \u201ctypically three\nto four times a month from five to 10 minutes by phone or on the internet webcam.\u201d\n1.b. Applicant's two brothers are citizens of the PRC, and they reside in Hong Kong.  One\nbrother is a computer programmer for a bank in Hong Kong, and her other brother is a musician and\ncomposer. Applicant\u2019s contact with her bothers happen several times a year by email. \nExhibit E includes statements from Applicant\u2019s parents and brothers. None of them has ever\nworked for or been associated with the Governments of the PRC, Hong Kong, or the United\nKingdom, and none of them are of have been members of the Communist party. All of Applicant\u2019s\nfamily members in Hong Kong have applied for and retain British National Overseas passports rather\nthan Hong Kong SAR passports that are issued by Hong Kong.\nApplicant testified that she has no known foreign assets, and she introduced Exhibits H, I,\nand J to show that she and her husband have considerable net worth in the United States, including\nher home and retirement accounts.\nApplicant introduced Exhibit C, which contains a Recognition Award and a Letter of\nAppreciation from her current employer for her outstanding contributions. Exhibit D includes five\n\n4\ncharacter letters including one from her immediate supervisor, one from the principal director of her\nemployer, and three from Air Force officers who have known during the last nine years. They\nstrongly recommend Applicant as loyal to the U.S. and highly trustworthy. \nSince Applicant moved to the United States in 1991, she has visited her family in Hong Kong\non three occasions in 2001, 2002, and in 2005 to visit her family.\nWhen he was questioned as to what he would do if a representative of the PRC threatened\nany member of her family if she did not cooperate with the government, she testified, \u201cI think I will\nbe deeply grieved, but I will not compromise anything, and I will by all means resist that and report\nthat to authorities if I can.\u201d (Tr at 98). \nFinally, Applicant testified that she intends to remain in the United States for the rest of her\nlife, and she has no plans to ever return permanently to Hong Kong or the PRC (Tr at 100).\n  \nParagraph 2 (Guideline C - Foreign Preference)\nThe Government alleges in this paragraph that the Applicant is ineligible for clearance\nbecause she has acted in such a way as to indicate a preference for another country over the United\nStates.\n2.a. The Government is concerned because, as of November 2, 2006, Applicant possessed\na current passport, issued by the United Kingdom. Applicant has not used it since she became a\nUnited States citizen. \nOn July 8, 2007, Applicant submitted to the British Embassy Consular Section a \u201cDeclaration\nof Renunciation of British National (Overseas) status\u201d form with the supporting documents,\nincluding her cancelled British National (Overseas) Passport, with the right front cover torn off to\nmake it invalid, as she had been instructed (Exhibit R). \nAn issue was raised at the hearing as to whether the PRC considers Chinese nationals, who\nlive abroad and become citizens of a country other than the PRC, no longer PRC citizens. Both\nparties offered some conflicting evidence on this point (Exhibits U and 4).  However, a ruling on that\nissue is not relevant because of the following: Applicant  never considered herself a citizen of the\nPRC, because  when she left  Hong Kong in 1991 it was under the control of Great Britain; when she\nbecame a U.S. citizen she renounced any other citizenship; and the only passport, other than from\nthe U.S., that she ever held was from Great Britain, and she renounced her British citizenship and\nreturned her British passport.\nCurrent Status of the PRC\nSince Applicant's parents and brothers are citizens of the PRC, it is important to consider the\nstatus of the PRC at this time.\n\n5\nThe PRC, the most populous country in the world, is economically powerful, and is an\nimportant trading partner of the United States. It is run by the Communist Party which controls all\naspects of the PRC government. It has strong military forces, and has its own foreign-policy.\nAlthough there has been some cooperation, there has been much more conflict with the United States\nin the past. The PRC has an extremely large army, a sophisticated defense establishment, and space\ncapability. The PRC has launched satellites, has ballistic missiles, has nuclear arms, and nuclear\nbombs. Its diplomatic and military dispute with the Republic of China (Taiwan), foreshadows a\npossible military conflict, which the United States opposes as a resolution of the conflict. The PRC\nhas an abysmal human rights record, which includes arbitrary killings; detention or incarceration\nwithout notice in mental facilities; torture; arbitrary arrest, detention or exile; no right to a public,\nfair trial; a politically controlled judiciary; lack of due process; restrictions on free speech, on\nreligious freedom, on freedom of travel, on freedom of assembly; and no rights of privacy - family,\nhome or correspondence. \nThe PRC engages in espionage against the United States through an extensive network of\nbusinesses, personnel, and specific programs designed to acquire advanced U.S. military technology.\nOne approach is to covertly conduct espionage by personnel from government ministries,\ncommissions, institutes, and military industries, independently of the PRC intelligence services. This\nis believed to be the major method of PRC intelligence activity in the United States. It also tries to\nidentify ethnic Chinese in the United States who have access to sensitive information, and sometimes\nis able to enlist their cooperation in illegal technology information transfers.\nPOLICIES\n           Enclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to be considered in evaluating\nan individual's security eligibility. The Administrative Judge must take into account the conditions\nraising or mitigating security concerns in each area applicable to the facts and circumstances\npresented. Each adjudicative decision must also assess the factors listed in Section F.3. and in\nEnclosure (2) of the Directive. Although the presence or absence of a particular condition for or\nagainst clearance is not determinative, the specific adjudicative guidelines should be followed\nwhenever a case can be measured against this policy guidance, as the guidelines reflect consideration\nof those factors of seriousness, recency, motivation, etc. \nBURDEN OF PROOF\nInitially, the Government must prove controverted facts alleged in the Statement of Reasons.\nIf the Government meets that burden, the burden of persuasion then shifts to the applicant to\nestablish his security suitability through evidence of refutation, extenuation or mitigation sufficient\nto demonstrate that, despite the existence of disqualifying conduct, it is nevertheless clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue the security clearance. Assessment of an\napplicant's fitness for access to classified information requires evaluation of the whole person, and\nconsideration of such factors as the recency and frequency of the disqualifying conduct, the\nlikelihood of recurrence, and evidence of rehabilitation.\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with\n\n6\nthe U.S. Government that is predicated upon trust and confidence. Where facts proven by the\nGovernment raise doubts about an applicant's judgment, reliability, or trustworthiness, the applicant\nhas a heavy burden of persuasion to demonstrate that he or she is nonetheless security worthy. As\nnoted by the United States Supreme Court in Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531\n(1988), \"the clearly consistent standard indicates that security-clearance determinations should err,\nif they must, on the side of denials.\"\nCONCLUSIONS\nHaving considered the evidence of record in light of the appropriate legal precepts and\nfactors, and having assessed the credibility of those who testified, I conclude the following with\nrespect to Guidelines B and C:\n(Guideline B - Foreign Influence) \nBased on the evidence of record, the Government has established an initial reason to deny\nApplicant a security clearance because of Guideline B (Foreign Influence). Applicant\u2019s relatives are\ncitizens of the PRC, which could create the potential for foreign influence that could result in the\ncompromise of classified information because it makes Applicant potentially vulnerable to coercion,\nexploitation, or pressure. The possession of such ties raises a security concern sufficient to require\nApplicant to present evidence in rebuttal, extenuation, or mitigation sufficient to meet her burden\nof persuasion that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security\nclearance for him. This Applicant has done.\n  In reviewing the Disqualifying Conditions (DC) I find that DC 7. (a) applies, contact with\nforeign family members, who are citizens and residents in a foreign country, if that contact creates\nheightened risk of foreign exploitation, pressure or coercion.   \nUnder Mitigating Conditions (MC) I have determined that MC 8. (b) applies as I find no\nconflict of interest because Applicant has such deep and longstanding relationships and loyalties, that\nany conflicts can be expected to be resolved in favor of the U.S. The factors that I have considered\nin applying MC 8. (b) and in reviewing Applicant under the \u201cwhole person concept\u201d include: the fact\nthat Applicant has lived in the U.S. since 1991, approximately half her life, she is married to an\nactive duty U.S. Air Force Major, she has twin daughters who are solely U.S. citizens, she received\nall of her college training in the United States, she has established a successful career here, she\nintroduced very powerful letters of recommendation from individuals in private industry and the U.S.\nmilitary, she and her husband have significant financial assets in the U.S., and finally her self\nproclaimed positive feelings for the U.S.\n \n        \nAfter considering all of the evidence of record on Guideline B, I conclude that the mitigating\nevidence substantially outweighs the evidence supporting the SOR .   \n(Guideline C - Foreign Preference)\nGuideline C is based on actions taken by an individual that indicate a preference for a foreign\ncountry over the United States. Applicant\u2019s retention of her British  passport raises foreign\n\n7\npreference (Guideline C) concerns. At the time the SOR was issued, DC 10. (a), the exercise of the\nprivilege of foreign citizenship could be argued to apply because (1) she retained her British\npassport. I conclude that since Applicant never used her passport, once she became a United States\ncitizen, and she ultimately revoked her foreign passport, MC 11. (c)  and (e) apply to this case.\nAccordingly, at this time it is clearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant  a\nsecurity clearance.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nParagraph 1. Guideline B: FOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a.: For Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b.: For  Applicant \nParagraph 2. Guideline C: FOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a.: For Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.\nMartin H.

Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.  \n \nOn October 9, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued \na Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under Guideline E, \nPersonal Conduct and Guideline J, Criminal Conduct. The action was taken under \nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February \n20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \n(Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President \non December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs \nissued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on November 26, 2007, and requested a \nhearing before an Administrative Judge. The case was assigned to another \nAdministrative Judge on January 17, 2008, and reassigned to me on January 31, 2008. \nMarch 27, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \nDOHA issued a notice of hearing on February 13, 2008, and the hearing was convened \nas scheduled on March 12, 2008. The government offered Exhibits (GE) 1 through 10, \nwhich were received without objection. Applicant testified on his own behalf, called one \nwitness, and submitted Exhibits (AE) A through F, without objection. DOHA received the \ntranscript of the hearing (Tr.) on March 21, 2008.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the factual allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.a through 1.d and 1.f through 1.i. He denied the remaining allegations.  \n \n \nApplicant is a 42-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He is attending \ncollege. He is married with no children.1 Applicant has had a number of jobs, some he \nleft voluntarily and some he left involuntarily. A number of the SOR allegations relate to \nconcerns about his employment. \n \n \nApplicant was terminated from employment with a company where he worked \nfrom about 1994 to 1995. He admitted he was \u201cfired,\u201d and indicated that he believed it \nmay have been related to his requesting a raise. He was working at a job site and was \ncalled back to a previous site and was informed they were letting him go. He further \nspeculated that the termination may have been related to the quality of his installation \nwork at the previous site, but he was never given a specific reason for the termination. \nNo other evidence was submitted as to why the company ended his employment.2  \n \n \nApplicant left employment with a company where he worked from about January \n1996 to August 1996, under \u201cunfavorable circumstances.\u201d Applicant did similar work on \nhis own to what he did for the company for family, friends, and other people. He stated \nthis could have been viewed as a conflict of interest. He did not use company tools or \nsupplies on the side jobs. No other evidence was submitted as to why his employment \nwas terminated.3  \n \n \nApplicant was terminated by his employer from a job he held from about March \n2002 to August 2002. He was not given a reason for the termination, other than they \ntold him that he had a brilliant mind, but they could not afford to keep him. He later was \nunable to locate the company and concluded that it went out of business and that he \nwas therefore \u201claid off.\u201d No other evidence was submitted as to why the company ended \nhis employment.4 \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.d alleges Applicant was terminated by his employer from a job he held \nfrom about October 2002 to June 2003, following charges of sexual harassment. \n                                                          \n1 Tr. at 172-173; GE 1, 2. \n \n2 Tr. at 34-38, 104-115; Applicant\u2019s Answer to SOR; GE 1, 6, 8.  \n \n3 Tr. at 39-44, 115-119; Applicant\u2019s Answer to SOR; GE 1, 6. 7. \n \n4 Tr. at 45-48, 120-124; Applicant\u2019s Answer to SOR; GE 1, 8. \n \n\n \n3 \n \nApplicant admitted he was terminated from his employment and that it followed an \nallegation of sexual harassment, but he denied that he sexually harassed anyone. He \nstated that in June 2003, he and his wife were planning a trip to a vacation resort. A \nfemale co-worker had recently returned from the same area. He asked the co-worker for \na picture intending to show it to his wife. The co-worker filed a complaint and Applicant \nwas subsequently terminated and told that the company had a zero tolerance policy. \nApplicant believes the true reason for the termination was a salary dispute. No evidence \nwas submitted to dispute Applicant\u2019s recitation of events.5 \n \n \nApplicant started working for a company in about November 2003. In about \nNovember 2004, the company initiated an investigation into allegations made by two \nfemales at his work site. The company concluded in a letter dated November 11, 2004: \n \n[Company] was unable to substantiate the allegations made by the two \nnon-[Company] employees. While the company has concluded that your \nwords and actions did not amount to a violation of the law or of company \npolicy, [Company] did conclude that you made insensitive comments \ninappropriate for the workplace, which contributed to the allegations being \nraised.6 \n \nApplicant stated that the allegations were related to a married male co-worker and a \nfemale employee at the work site. Applicant advised him that they should not spend so \nmuch time together, and at one point referred to her in front of him as a \u201cchicken head,\u201d \nwhich he described as \u201csomeone who doesn\u2019t commit and walks around getting into \neverything.\u201d When the male co-worker stated that Applicant could lose his job for his \ncomments, Applicant responded with words to the effect: \n \nI have a perfect record, no write ups, I come to work everyday and do my \njob. If some one come after my job I will come after them and squash \nthem like a bug legally.7 \n \nNo evidence was submitted to counter Applicant\u2019s account of the events. At some point \nApplicant went to a part-time status, but he continued to work at the same company \nuntil he resigned almost a year later in about October 2005.8 \n \n \nApplicant was denied access to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and \nExplosives (ATF) information and/or facilities on June 22, 2005. ATF based the denial in \npart on Applicant\u2019s unfavorable employment history and his \u201clack of candor in \ndiscussing the reasons for [his] termination with [Company alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.d].\u201d9  \n                                                          \n5 Tr. at 48-60, 124-139; Applicant\u2019s Answer to SOR; GE 1, 2, 8. \n \n6 GE 2. \n \n7 Id. \n \n8 Tr. at 61-74, 100, 139-146; Applicant\u2019s Answer to SOR; GE 1, 2, 8; AE D. \n \n9 Tr. at 66-73; Applicant\u2019s Answer to SOR; GE 2. \n\n \n4 \n \n \nApplicant was laid off from employment with a company in about June 2005, as \nalleged in SOR \u00b6 1.g, after he failed to obtain access to ATF information and/or \nfacilities.10 \n \n \nApplicant started working for a company in June 2005. He was responsible for \nchecking the room at the end of the day for classified materials. In about the fall of \n2005, Applicant came to work in the morning. Two co-workers told him that they found a \nclassified computer drive that had been left unsecured the previous night by one of his \nco-workers. The hard drive was in a cubicle out of plain sight. The hard drive was \nmarked as classified, but it was brand new and had not yet been used, so no actual \nclassified information was on the drive. They discussed reporting the incident. Applicant \ndid not feel that it was his fault that the drive was left unsecured and the discussion \nbecame heated. He told them to do what they had to do and that he would see them \nlater. The co-workers may have taken the statements as a veiled threat, something \nApplicant vehemently denies. Applicant requested and was granted a transfer to a \ndifferent team. No disciplinary action was taken against him. He continued to work for \nthe company until he voluntarily left the company in about April 2007.11 \n \n \nApplicant has been attending college off and on since he first enrolled in July \n1999. The college has a workplace mentor program. Material from the college describes \nthe workplace mentor as \u201cusually the student\u2019s supervisor, but sometimes an \nexperienced colleague, [who] assists the student in those aspects of the program that \nrelate directly to the workplace.\u201d Other options also exist when the above is not a viable \noption. Applicant had to repeat three classes that he took in 2002. He stated that his \nmentor was a member of the faculty who left employment with the school. A mentor was \nrequired to fill out an evaluation for certain class projects. When it came time for him to \nturn in his work, Applicant was unable to contact his mentor. He stated his instructor told \nhim to sign the form himself, which he did. This ultimately resulted in Applicant having to \nretake three classes. Applicant\u2019s faculty advisor wrote a letter on July 24, 2007, stating \nthat Applicant was not suspended; he elected to discontinue classes and that \u201cwhile \nthere was an issue regarding certain classes, it was not plagiarism.\u201d12 \n \nApplicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for National Security Positions \n(SF 86) certified as true on October 3, 2005. Applicant answered \u201cYes\u201d to Question 22, \nwhich asked about adverse employment terminations. He listed that he was fired from \nthe company alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.d, and provided a detailed discussion about the \ntermination and how it related to his salary dispute. SOR \u00b6 1.j alleges that Applicant \nfalsified the SF 86 by not fully discussing the circumstances surrounding his termination \nfrom the company alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.d and by failing to list his termination of \nemployment from the company alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.g, following his inability to obtain \n                                                                                                                                                                                           \n \n10 Id. \n \n11 Tr. at 73-79, 146-153; Applicant\u2019s Answer to SOR; GE 2. \n \n12 Tr. at 80-84, 101, 153-164; Applicant\u2019s Answer to SOR; GE 1, 2, 9; AE E. \n \n\n \n5 \n \naccess to ATF information and/or facilities. While he may not have included all the \ninformation directly on the SF 86, he attached 11 pages of documents to the \nquestionnaire, which discussed both incidents in great detail.13 \n \n \nOn the same SF 86, Applicant answered \u201cNo\u201d to Question 26, which asked in \npart if he \u201cever had a clearance or access authorization denied, suspended, or \nrevoked,\u201d or if he had \u201cever been debarred from government employment.\u201d SOR \u00b6 1.k \nalleges Applicant falsified material facts on the SF 86 by deliberately failing to list that \nhe was denied access to ATF information and/or facilities in 2005. Applicant testified he \nmisinterpreted the question and he did not think the ATF denial had to be included in \nthis question. He clearly was not trying to withhold this information from the government \nas he included a copy of the ATF denial letter in the attachments to the SF 86.14 \n \n \nApplicant submitted a Questionnaire for Public Trust Positions (SF 85P) certified \nas true on February 23, 2006. He answered \u201cYes\u2019\u201d to Question 12, which asked about \nadverse employment terminations. He listed that he was fired from the company alleged \nin SOR \u00b6 1.d, writing that the reason was because of a \u201c[r]eduction in pay dispute.\u201d Like \nthe SF 86 he submitted approximately four and a half months earlier, he again \nanswered \u201cNo\u201d to the question which asked if he ever was denied a clearance or \naccess. SOR \u00b6 1.l alleges that Applicant falsified the SF 85P by not fully discussing the \ncircumstances surrounding his termination from that company and by failing to list his \ntermination of employment from the companies alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e and 1.g. \nApplicant listed all three companies in the employment history section of the \nquestionnaire. SOR \u00b6 1.m alleges Applicant falsified the SF 85P by not listing the denial \nof access to ATF information and/or facilities in 2005. Applicant testified that he gave \nthe same attachments to his security officer as he provided with the previous \nquestionnaire. When he was interviewed for his background investigation on May 22, \n2006, the investigator had a copy of the attachments.15  \n \n \nI find that Applicant did not intentionally falsify either the 2005 SF 86 or the 2006 \nSF 85P. There is independent evidence that Applicant provided all the requested \ninformation as attachments to the 2005 SF 86. While there is no independent evidence \nthat Applicant attached the same documents to the 2006 SF 85P, it is not logical to \nbelieve that he would attempt to hide from the government the facts that he previously \ndivulged several months earlier. \n \n \nA statement was not provided of Applicant\u2019s background interview on May 22, \n2006, but the interview was summarized in a Report of Investigation (ROI). Applicant \nwas sent Interrogatories containing the ROI and was asked if the ROI accurately \nreflected the information that he provided to the investigator. He certified on July 23, \n2007 that it was accurate, with some minor corrections. He was provided an opportunity \n                                                          \n13 Tr. at 60, 85-88; Applicant\u2019s Answer to SOR; GE 1, 2. \n \n14 Tr. at 89-91, 168-171; GE 1, 2. \n \n15 Tr. at 92-96, 165-167; GE 2, 3, 8. \n \n\n \n6 \n \nto add additional information regarding the matters discussed during his interview and \nsubmitted a statement about the issue with the mentor, as discussed above, and the \nletter from his faculty advisor. The ROI contains information about Applicant\u2019s \neducation, and includes the sentence, \u201cHe is unknown to school disciplinarians.\u201d This \nsentence forms the basis for SOR \u00b6 1.n, which alleges that Applicant \u201cdeliberately failed \nto disclose that [he was] required to retake classes following an inquiry into allegations \nof improper conduct.\u201d Applicant has admitted that he was required to retake three \ncourses.16 That is not enough to extrapolate that there was \u201can inquiry into allegations of \nimproper conduct.\u201d This was not a sworn or a signed statement; it is a summarized ROI, \nwithout the testimony of the interviewer. Applicant stated the interview was about five \nhours long. He stated the interviewer asked him if he had any problems at the college \nand he responded that he did not. His having to retake classes did not come to his mind \nat that time. He testified that he was never disciplined at the school, but acknowledged \nthat some people could interpret the retaking of the classes as a form of disciplinary \naction. There is insufficient evidence for a finding that Applicant intentionally provided \nfalse or misleading information to the investigator, or concealed information. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s first day with his current employer was the day before the hearing. He \nchanged jobs for greater compensation. His supervisor at his previous employment \ntestified on his behalf. He rated Applicant\u2019s job performance as outstanding and \ndescribed him as reliable, trustworthy and someone who gets along with everybody. \nThirteen character letters were submitted on his behalf. Applicant is described as \ncompetent, dependable, efficient, honest, responsible, hard working, reliable, \ncompassionate, and resourceful, with a high degree of integrity.17 \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \n                                                          \n16 Tr. at 96-99; Applicant\u2019s Answer to SOR; GE 1, 2, 8. \n \n17 Tr. at 21-32, 99; AE C. \n \n\n \n7 \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct  \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in \nAG \u00b6 15: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following are potentially applicable:  \n \n\n \n8 \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; \n \n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information concerning \nrelevant facts to an employer, investigator, security official, competent \nmedical authority, or other official government representative; \n \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-\nperson \nassessment \nof \nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the person may not \nproperly safeguard protected information; \n \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information \nsupports \na \nwhole-person \nassessment \nof \nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply \nwith rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the \nperson may not properly safeguard protected information. This includes \nbut is not limited to consideration of: \n \n(1) untrustworthy or unreliable behavior to include breach of client \nconfidentiality, release of proprietary information, unauthorized \nrelease of sensitive corporate or other government protected \ninformation; \n \n(2) disruptive, violent, or other inappropriate behavior in the \nworkplace;  \n \n(3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations;  \n \n(4) evidence of significant misuse of Government or other \nemployer\u2019s time or resources; \n \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one's conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress, such as \n(1) engaging in activities which, if known, may affect the person's personal, \nprofessional, or community standing; and  \n \n(f) violation of a written or recorded commitment made by the individual to \nthe employer as a condition of employment.  \n\n \n9 \n \n \nApplicant did not deliberately omit, conceal, or falsify relevant facts on his \nquestionnaires. SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.j through 1.m are concluded for Applicant. The government \nhas not established that Applicant deliberately provided false or misleading information \nabout his college education during his background interview. SOR \u00b61.n is also \nconcluded for Applicant.  \n \n \nA number of the SOR allegations refer to Applicant being terminated from \nemployment. There can be a number of reasons for a job termination that have \nabsolutely no correlation with a person\u2019s conduct or security worthiness. SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a \nand 1.c allege that Applicant was fired from employment in 1995 and 2002, but does not \nprovide a reason for the termination. No evidence was submitted that Applicant\u2019s \npersonal conduct was the basis for the terminations. Applicant left employment under \nunfavorable circumstances in 1996, as alleged in SOR \u00b61.b, when there was a potential \nconflict of interest because he was working on the side doing similar business as his \ncompany.  \n \n \nApplicant was terminated from employment in 2003, as alleged in SOR \u00b61.d, \nfollowing charges of sexual harassment. Applicant admitted he was terminated but \ndenied that his actions of asking a co-worker for a picture constituted sexual \nharassment. The government presented no evidence that the incident happened in any \nway other than described by Applicant. I find that the incident as described by Applicant \ndid not amount to sexual harassment.  \n \n \nSOR \u00b61.e alleges Applicant resigned from employment in October 2005, \nfollowing an investigation into allegations of sexual harassment. The allegations and \ninvestigation were in November 2004. The company was unable to substantiate the \nallegations but concluded Applicant made insensitive comments inappropriate for the \nworkplace. No evidence was submitted at the hearing for a finding that Applicant \nsexually harassed anyone during this period. There is sufficient evidence that he made \ninsensitive comments in the workplace. There is no evidence that his resignation almost \na year later was connected to the allegations.  \n \n \nApplicant was denied access to ATF information and/or facilities in June 2005, as \nalleged in SOR \u00b61.f, essentially for the same reasons as the allegations in the SOR. \nThe government did not submit evidence of personal conduct additional to what was \nalready alleged in other allegations of the SOR. Applicant was terminated from \nemployment in June 2005, because he was unable to obtain ATF access. This does not \nallege inappropriate personal conduct on Applicant\u2019s behalf. It alleges a consequence of \nother personal conduct by Applicant, which is discussed under other allegations. \n \n \nApplicant voluntarily transferred to a different office in 2005, after a somewhat \nheated discussion with co-workers after a classified hard drive was left unsecured \novernight. Department Counsel stated the personal conduct concern in SOR \u00b61.h was \nnot the potential security violation, but was Applicant\u2019s conduct during the heated \ndiscussion. Applicant admitted the discussion became heated and that he told them to \ndo what they had to do and that he would see them later. He denied that he meant this \nin any way to be a threat.  \n\n \n10 \n \n \nApplicant had to repeat three college classes that he took in 2002, after he \nsigned a form that was to be signed by his mentor. He stated his instructor told him to \nsign the form himself, after Applicant was unable to contact his mentor. His faculty \nadvisor wrote a letter stating that Applicant was not suspended, and there was an issue \nregarding certain classes, but it did not amount to plagiarism. \n \n \nVirtually all the information which formed the basis for the allegations in the SOR \ncame from Applicant, through his questionnaires, his attachments to his questionnaires, \nhis interviews with investigators, and his responses to Interrogatories. Some allegations \nof the SOR were not established by evidence, as discussed above. Several other \nallegations were true but did not invoke a security concern. The admitted information of \nconcern is that Applicant\u2019s side job in 1996 involved a potential conflict of interest with \nhis employment; he retook college classes in 2002 after he signed a form at the \ndirection of his instructor; he asked a co-worker for a picture in 2003; he made \ninsensitive comments in 2004; and he had a heated discussion with co-workers in 2005. \nThis information is sufficient to raise AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(d) and 16(e). On a number of occasions \nDepartment Counsel raised suggestions of personal conduct, but did not submit any \nevidence to rebut Applicant\u2019s account of events. Questions by Department Counsel, \nwithout admissions by an applicant, do not constitute record evidence. A credibility \ndetermination is not a substitute for record evidence.18  \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was \ncaused or significantly contributed to by improper or inadequate advice of \nauthorized personnel or legal counsel advising or instructing the individual \nspecifically concerning the security clearance process. Upon being made \naware of the requirement to cooperate or provide the information, the \nindividual cooperated fully and truthfully; \n \n                                                          \n18 In ISCR Case No. 02-12789 at 4 (App. Bd. May 13, 2005) (citing ISCR Case No. 02-24452 at \n4-5 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2004), the Appeal Board stated: \n \nAn unfavorable credibility determination provides an Administrative Judge with a basis for \ndeciding to disbelieve an applicant's testimony. However, mere disbelief of that \ntestimony, standing alone, is not a sufficient basis for a Judge to conclude that an \napplicant did something (e.g., engaged in drug use or other acts constituting poor \njudgment other than on a given date) for which there is no independent evidence. An \napplicant does not have the burden of disproving a controverted fact; rather, the burden \nof proving controverted facts falls on Department Counsel. If an applicant has not \nadmitted to engaging in specific acts of misconduct, and if there is no record evidence in \nthat regard, then a Judge has no rational basis to find such misconduct occurred. \n(internal citations omitted)  \n \n\n \n11 \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, \nor other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur; \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress; \n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable \nreliability;  \n(g) association with persons involved in criminal activity has ceased or \noccurs under circumstances that do not cast doubt upon the individual\u2019s \nreliability, judgment, or willingness to comply with rules and the individual \nhas taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability to exploitation, \nmanipulation, or duress. \nI contrast the established nominal personal conduct with the very favorable \ncharacter evidence presented by Applicant. On balance, I find the conduct is minor, so \nmuch time has passed, and it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on Applicant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and \ngood judgment. AG \u00b6 16(c) is applicable. \n \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct  \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Criminal Conduct is set out in \nAG \u00b6 30: \n \nCriminal activity creates doubt about an applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, \nand trustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s \nability or willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations. \n \nIt is a criminal offense to knowingly and willfully make any materially false, \nfictitious, or fraudulent statement or representation in any matter within the executive \nbranch of the Government of the United States. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001. Security clearances \nare within the jurisdiction of the executive branch of the Government of the United \nStates. A violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001 is a serious offense as it may be punished by \nimprisonment for up to five years. Applicant did not knowingly and willfully make \nmaterially false statements on his questionnaires and interview, as discussed above. No \nCriminal Conduct Disqualifying Condition is applicable. \n \n \n\n \n12 \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and \nother permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant has held many different \njobs, some of which he left involuntarily. He has been involved in several minor \nincidents of questionable personal conduct, the most recent in the fall of 2005. \nDepartment Counsel asked about other conduct, which Applicant denied, but submitted \nno evidence to substantiate the conduct. Virtually every piece of adverse information \nabout Applicant came directly or indirectly from him. I also considered the testimony of \nhis witness and the very favorable character letters. I do not find that Applicant\u2019s \nconduct can be a basis for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has mitigated the security concerns arising from his personal and \ncriminal conduct.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline E:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.n: \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline J:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \nFor Applicant \n\n \n13 \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nEdward W.

Applicant \nhas been making payments on the two largest, disputes one debt, has reached \nrepayment agreements on four additional debts, and intends to pay all his obligations. \nApplicant has successfully mitigated financial considerations and personal conduct \nconcerns. Clearance is granted.  \n \nStatement of Case \n \n \nApplicant contests the Defense Department\u2019s intent to deny or revoke his \neligibility for an industrial security clearance. Acting under the relevant Executive Order \nand DoD Directive,1 the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued to \nApplicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) on October 26, 2007, detailing security \n \n \n \n1\n                                                          \n1 Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, \n1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative \nguidelines (AG) approved by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of \nDefense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \nAugust 11, 2008\n\n \n \n \n2\nconcerns under Guideline F, fianancial considerations, and Guideline E, personal \nconduct. \n \n \nOn January 8, 2008, Applicant answered the SOR, and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge. On January 31, 2008, I was assigned the case. On April \n11, 2008, DOHA issued a notice of hearing scheduling the hearing to be held on April \n21, 2008. For good cause, a continuance was granted. On June 6, 2008, DOHA issued \na notice of hearing scheduling the hearing held on June 27, 2008. The government \noffered Exhibits (Ex.) 1 through 5, which were admitted into evidence. Applicant testified \non his own behalf and submitted Exhibits A through D, which were admitted into \nevidence. The record was kept open to allow Applicant to submit additional matters. On \nJuly 17, 2008, additional documents were received. Department Counsel did not object \nto the material, which was admitted into evidence as Ex. E. On July 18, 2008, the \ntranscript (Tr.) was received.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant denied the factual allegations in \u00b6 1.e and \u00b6 \n2.a of the SOR and was without sufficient information to either admit or deny the \nallegation in \u00b6 1.c. He admitted the remaining allegations. \n \n \nApplicant is a 57-year-old truck driver who has worked for a defense contractor \nsince October 1992 and is seeking to obtain a security clearance. Applicant and his wife \nare long haul truckers. In March 2008, a favorable security clearance determination was \nmade as to Applicant\u2019s wife (ISCR Case Number 07-01646). Applicant recently \npurchased a new truck, a 2008 Peterbilt on which is owed $145,000. Applicant pays \n$3,000 monthly for the truck tractor payment and $700 for the trailer.  \n \nIn March 2008, Applicant sold his previous truck, a 1998 Peterbilt, for $31,000. \nApproximately $13,000 of the proceeds was paid to move the sleeper portion of the cab \nfrom the old truck to the new truck. Applicant was off the road for six weeks while the \nnew truck was prepared. (Ex. A) An additional $16,000 was applied to the truck \npayment on their new truck.  \n \n \nFrom 1994 to 2000, Applicant\u2019s wife was unemployed and receiving Social \nSecurity disability due to migraine headaches and Crohn\u2019s disease. She was unable to \nassist Applicant with the driving. In May 2008, she was released by her doctor to return \nto driving their truck. Applicant\u2019s new truck is so configured to allow her to resume truck \ndriving. Previously, her doctor provided her with a limited supply of migraine medication. \nWhen traveling and her medication ran out, she got migraine headaches that resulted in \nemergency room visits, with associated medical fees. Now that her doctor has agreed to \nprovide her with a full month\u2019s prescription she anticipates emergency room visits will be \neliminated when they are on the road.  \n \nIn March 2003, his wife experienced a slip and fall in a store breaking her knee \ncap resulting in numerous surgeries and treatments. She has had over 77 treatments. \nMedicare paid 80% of the medical bills. The creditor listed in \u00b6 1.h is collecting for 26 \n\n \n \n \n3\nmedical debts totaling approximately $6,500. Payments on this debt have been made \non his debts for more than 18 months. (Ex. D) Monthly payments are reviewed every six \nmonths. Monthly payments started at $250, were raised to $400, and then to $800. In \nJuly 2008, the monthly payments were reevaluated and lowered to $450.  \n \n \nA summary of Applicant\u2019s debts follows: \n \n \n \n \n \nCreditor \n \nAmount  \n \nCurrent Status \na \nFederal tax lien. \n \n$19,377 \nApplicant was paying $500 per month and \nhas now engaged a company to negotiate a \nsettlement with the IRS.

Applicant is \nattempting to locate the creditor. (Ex. E) \n \n \n$31,910 \nTotal debt listed in SOR \n \n \nThe court date for his wife\u2019s lawsuit was set for August 2008 with mediation in the \nmatter started on January 2008. (Ex. A) The lawsuit has now been reset for June 2009.  \n \n \nApplicant and his wife owed the IRS approximately $19,000 (SOR \u00b6 1.a) for tax \nyears 2001, 2002, and 2003. Since November 2005, they have been paying the IRS \n$500 per month to address this debt. Until recently the amount was automatically \n\n \n \n \n4\ndeducted as a voluntary levy. The amount is now paid directly by Applicant. Applicant \nhas been paying the IRS monthly for two and a half years. Applicant has recently \nemployed a law firm (Ex. E) who is attempting to negotiate a settlement of the remaining \nIRS debt. Applicant is current on his state tax. (Ex. C) \n \n \nApplicant disputes the debt listed in SOR \u00b6 1.e ($1,425) for the 1999 purchase of \na computer through a telephone company. When the computer arrived it was defective. \nA service representative came to Applicant\u2019s home and attempted to fix the hard drive \non the machine. He was unable to fix the computer and suggested Applicant return it to \nthe company, which was done. Since returning the computer, Applicant has disputed \nthe debt. (Ex. A) \n \n \nApplicant contacted the creditor listed in SOR \u00b6 1.d ($1,727). The creditor offered \nto settle the matter for $1,077, which Applicant accepted. (Ex. B and E) \n \n \nApplicant previously contacted the hospital about the debt listed in SOR \u00b6 1.g \n($485).  The hospital agreed to send Applicant a statement as to the balance but failed \nto do so.  Applicant again contacted the hospital and has agreed to pay the debt in \nmonthly statements. (Ex. E) \n \nApplicant denied deliberately failing to list his debts that had ever been more than \n180 days delinquent, or were currently more than 90 days delinquent. When completing \nhis SF 86, Applicant knew he had bills, but was unaware any were delinquent. Question \n35 asked if he had been subject to a wage garnishment during the previous seven \nyears. He answered \u201cno\u201d because the action to repay his tax obligation was a voluntary \nwage assignment and not a wage garnishment.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s income fluctuates depending on the cargo carried, the number trips \nmade, the number of miles traveled, and how many people are driving. When both \nApplicant and his wife are driving, they receive approximately 20% more per mile \ndriven. \n \nAs long-haul, over the road truck drivers there are periods of time when Applicant \nand his wife are away from home for extended periods. Additionally, they live in a trailer \npark and should any mail fail to list the lot number, the mail is not delivered, but returned \nto the post office. Applicant stresses the importance of the lot number to his creditors, \nbut is aware mail has been returned because the lot number is missing.  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \n\n \n \n \n5\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \n \nUnder Guideline F (financial considerations) a security concern typically exists \ndue to significant unpaid debts. Failure or inability to live within one's means, satisfy \ndebts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \n\n \n \n \n6\n                                                          \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about \nan individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information.2 \n \n \nAn individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in \nillegal or unethical acts to generate funds to meet financial obligations. Additionally, an \nindividual who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, unconcerned, \nnegligent, or careless in properly handling and safeguarding classified information. \nBehaving responsibly or irresponsibly in one aspect of life provides an indication of how \na person may behave in other aspects of life.  \n \nA person\u2019s relationship with his creditors is a private matter until evidence is \nuncovered demonstrating an inability or unwillingness to repay debts under agreed \nupon terms. Absent evidence of strong extenuating or mitigating circumstances, an \napplicant with a history of serious or recurring financial difficulties is in a position of risk \nthat is inconsistent with holding a security clearance. An applicant is not required to be \ndebt free, but is required to manage his finances so as to meet his financial obligations. \n \n \nThe record evidence supports a conclusion Applicant has a history of financial \nproblems. Applicant owed approximately $32,000 to 12 creditors. Disqualifying \nConditions (DC) \u00b6 19(a) \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts\u201d and 19(c) \u201ca history \nof not meeting financial obligations,\u201d apply.  \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 20(a), the disqualifying condition may be mitigated where Athe \nbehavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual=s \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ Applicant=s financial problems \nwere contributed to by numerous surgeries and medical treatment related to Applicant\u2019s \nwife\u2019s migraine headaches and her slip and fall that destroyed her knee cap.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s wife has only recently been medically cleared to return to driving, \nwhich will result in a 20% increase in their mileage amount received. His wife\u2019s doctor \nhas also agreed to provide his wife with a full month\u2019s prescription of migraine medicine \nwhich will result in fewer emergency room visits. AG & 20(a) applies. \n \nAG & 20(b), Athe conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual \nacted responsibly under the circumstances,@ applies. Applicant\u2019s wife experienced \nunexpected medical emergencies with both migraine headaches and her knee injury \nwith the associated financial burden. Applicant and his wife have paid what they were \nable to on their debts. AG & 20(b) applies. \n \nAG & 20(d) applies where the evidence shows Athe individual initiated a good-\nfaith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. 3@ Applicant has paid a \n \n2 Revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) \u00b6 18. \n3In ISCR Case No. 07-06482 (App. Bd. May 22, 2008) the Appeal Board explained how financial \nresponsibility under Guideline F can be demonstrated: \n\n \n \n \n7\n                                                                                                                                                                                          \nnumber of the medical bills. Applicant has been making monthly payments on his two \nlargest debts (SOR \u00b6 1.a, $19,000 and SOR \u00b6 1.h, $6,476), which represents more than \n80% of his total debt obligation. He has been paying one creditor for more than 18 \nmonths and paying the IRS for more than two and a half years.  \n \nApplicant has agreed to make monthly payments on four additional debts (SOR \u00b6 \n1.b, $236; SOR \u00b6 1.d, $1,727; \u00b6 1.f, $124; and, SOR \u00b6 1.g, $485). Applicant is waiting \nfor a response from the collection agency that has two debts (SOR \u00b6 1.j, $474 and SOR \n\u00b6 1.k, $543) Applicant has contacted the two remaining creditors. The collection agency \nfor debt SOR \u00b6 1.i, $391 no longer has the debt. The credit report telephone number for \nthe creditor listed in SOR \u00b6 1.l, $221 is not working. Applicant is attempting to locate the \ncreditors for these two debts.  \n \nAG & 20(e) applies where the evidence shows \u201cthe individual has a reasonable \nbasis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem \nand provides documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue.\u201d Applicant disputes he owes the debt listed in \nSOR \u00b6 1.e ($1,425). Applicant purchased a computer that was defective. When the \ncomputer could not be fixed, Applicant followed the repair person\u2019s suggestion and \nreturned the defective computer to the company.  \n \n \nShould his wife receive a settlement on her slip and fall case, the remaining bills \ncould easily be paid. Even without settlement Applicant has arranged payments with \nother creditors in the past and his long history of payments indicates his creditors will be \npaid. The remaining debts do not raise concerns about his current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment.  \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \n \nThe allegations under Guideline E, personal conduct, are refuted. The \nGovernment has shown Applicant's answers to questions 35, 38 and 39 were incorrect, \nbut this does not prove the Applicant deliberately failed to disclose information about his \n \n \nIn evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the concept of \u201c\u2018meaningful \ntrack record\u2019 necessarily includes evidence of actual debt reduction through payment of debts.\u201d See, \ne.g., ISCR Case No. 05-01920 at 5 (App. Bd. Mar. 1, 2007). However, an applicant is not required, \nas a matter of law, to establish that he has paid off each and every debt listed in the SOR. See, e.g., \nISCR Case No. 02-25499 at 2 (App. Bd. Jun. 5, 2006). All that is required is that an applicant \ndemonstrate that he has \u201c. . . established a plan to resolve his financial problems and taken \nsignificant actions to implement that plan.\u201d See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 04-09684 at 2 (App. Bd. Jul. 6, \n2006). The Judge can reasonably consider the entirety of an applicant\u2019s financial situation and his \nactions in evaluating the extent to which that applicant\u2019s plan for the reduction of his outstanding \nindebtedness is credible and realistic. See Directive \u00b6 E2.2 (a) (\u201cAvailable, reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be considered in reaching a \ndetermination.\u201d) There is no requirement that a plan provide for payments on all outstanding debts \nsimultaneously. Rather, a reasonable plan (and concomitant conduct) may provide for the payment \nof such debts one at a time. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-25584 at 4 (App. Bd. Apr. 4, 2008). \nLikewise, there is no requirement that the first debts actually paid in furtherance of a reasonable \ndebt plan be the ones listed in the SOR.  \n\n \n \n \n8\nfinances. The Applicant has denied intentional falsification. In July 2004, when \ncompleting his SF 86, Applicant did not list any debts as having ever been more than \n180 days delinquent or being currently more than 90 days delinquent. At the time he \ncompleted his SF 86, he knew he had debts, but did not believe any of them were \ndelinquent. He did not list a wage garnishment in response to question 35 because his \npayment to the IRS was a voluntary wage assignment and not a garnishment. \n \nDeliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of a material fact in any written \ndocument or oral statement to the Government when applying for a security clearance \nis a security concern. But every inaccurate statement is not a falsification. A falsification \nmust be deliberate and material. It is deliberate if it is done knowingly and willfully. An \nomission concerning delinquent debt is not deliberate if the person did not know of their \nexistence or failed to remember them. The Applicant was unaware his accounts were \ndelinquent when completing his SF 86. Applicant\u2019s job took him away from home for \nlong periods of time, thereby limiting his access to his mail. Additionally, if his mail failed \nto list his lot number, the mail was not delivered.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s explanation of his negative answers on his SF 86 was plausible. After \nhearing his testimony, observing his demeanor, and evaluating all the evidence of \nrecord, I found his testimony credible on the falsification issue. I am satisfied he did not \nintentionally falsify his SF 86.  \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a) \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.  \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. The debts incurred were not the \ntype that indicates poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules \nand regulations. Money was not spent frivolously. The debts set forth in the SOR were \nnot incurred on luxuries. The majority were for medical treatment and taxes. \n\n \n \n \n9\n \nApplicant is making monthly payments on the two largest debts and reached a \nrepayment agreement on four others. These debts cannot be a source of improper \npressure or duress. Applicant is addressing his debts. He is attempting to locate the \ncreditors of the remaining two debts. The issue is not simply whether all his debts are \nbeing paid\u2014it is whether his financial circumstances raise concerns about his fitness to \nhold a security clearance. (See AG & 2(a) (1)) Applicant is paying his bills. The length of \ntime he has been making payments gives me confidence he will continue to make \npayment until his obligations are paid. \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant mitigated the security concerns arising from his financial \nconsiderations.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a-1.l: \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline F:  \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a- 2.c: \nFor Applicant \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

Crowley, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nMALONE, Matthew E., Administrative Judge:\nBased upon a review of the pleadings and exhibits, Applicant has failed to\nmitigate the security concerns raised by the government\u2019s information about his\nfinances and personal conduct. Accordingly, his request for a security clearance is\ndenied.\nOn April 16, 2006, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for\nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP) to request a security clearance for his employment\nwith a defense contractor. After reviewing the results of the ensuing background\ninvestigation, adjudicators for the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nwere unable to make a preliminary affirmative finding  that it is clearly consistent with\n1\nthe national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s request. \nOn July 26, 2007, DOHA issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR),\nwhich specified the basis for its decision \u2013 security concerns addressed in the Directive\nMay 22, 2008\n\n Adjudication of this case is controlled by the Revised Adjudicative Guidelines, approved by the President on\n2\nDecember 29, 2005,which were implemented by the Department of Defense on September 1, 2006. Pending\nofficial revision of the Directive, the Revised Adjudicative Guidelines supercede the guidelines listed in\nEnclosure 2 to the Directive, and they apply to all adjudications or trustworthiness determinations in which an\nSOR was issued on or after September 1, 2006.\n See Directive, Enclosure 3, Section E3.1.7. The FORM included 11 documents (Items 1 - 11) proffered in\n3\nsupport of the government\u2019s case.\n2\nunder Guideline E (personal conduct), Guideline F (financial considerations), and\nGuideline J (criminal conduct) of the Revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG).  More\n2\nspecifically, the government alleged that in 1995 Applicant was charged and convicted\nof driving while intoxicated (DWI) (SOR \u00b6 1.a), and that there are two active warrants for\nhis arrest issued in 1999 (SOR \u00b6 1.b) and 2000 (SOR \u00b6 1.c). It was also alleged\nApplicant owed $22,717 for 11 delinquent debts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a - 2.k), and that he\ndeliberately falsified his e-QIP by answering \u201cno\u201d to questions in section 23 (regarding\nany arrests for drug or alcohol-related offenses) and to questions in section 28\n(regarding debts greater than 180 days past due in the preceding seven years).\nOn September 12, 2007, Applicant answered the SOR and admitted the\nallegations of criminal conduct in SOR \u00b6 1, and denied all of the allegations of\nindebtedness in SOR 2. In his response to the allegations in SOR \u00b6 3 that he falsified\nhis e-QIP answers, he uses the phrase \u201cI admit;\u201d however, it appears he is addressing\nnot the issue of falsification but the underlying conduct or facts. Accordingly, his\nresponses to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 3.a and 3.b are entered as denials.\nOn January 31, 2008, DOHA Department Counsel submitted a file of relevant\nmaterials (FORM)  in support of the government\u2019s preliminary decision. Applicant\n3\nreceived the FORM on February 6, 2008, and was given 30 days to file a response to\nthe FORM. He submitted nothing before the deadline, and the case was assigned to me\non May 2, 2008.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant\u2019s admissions in response to the SOR are admitted as fact. After a\nthorough review of the pleadings, Applicant\u2019s response to the SOR, and the exhibits\ncontained in the government\u2019s FORM, I make the following additional findings of fact.\nApplicant is 49 years old and seeks a security clearance for his employment with\na defense contractor, where he has worked as a security guard since November 2005.\nAccording to his response to e-QIP question 26, Applicant was investigated for and/or\nreceived a secret-level security clearance in about August 1985. He attended college\nfrom 1976 until 1979, and is a twice-married father of three children, ages 24, 18, and\n13. His first marriage began in March 1981 and ended by divorce in July 2001. His\nsecond marriage began in October 2001. As of June 2005, he was separated from his\nwife. (FORM, Item 4) In response to the SOR (Item 2) and to DOHA interrogatories\n(Item 8), referred to a pending divorce, but provided no dates or other details. \n\n Directive. 6.3.\n4\n3\nAfter Applicant submitted his e-QIP in April 2006, Office of Personnel\nManagement (OPM) investigators obtained a report of his credit history as of April 25,\n2006 (FORM, Item 5). That report showed Applicant owed approximately $22,390 for\nten delinquent debts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a - 2.k). All but one of the debts listed in Item 5 were\nindividual debts for which Applicant alone is responsible. A car repossession from 2006\nresulted from non-payment on a joint car loan, presumably taken out with one of his\nwives. (SOR \u00b6 2.k) The credit report also showed Applicant\u2019s home mortgage of\n$111,370 was foreclosed in January 2005. There is no available information showing\nthat any of Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts have been paid or otherwise resolved.\nIn April 1995, Applicant was arrested, charged, and convicted of DWI (SOR \u00b6\n1.a). He was sentenced to 60 days in jail, of which 53 days was suspended. He also\nwas assessed fines and court costs of $1,800, his driver\u2019s license was suspended for\none year, and was ordered to attended Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) meetings for one\nyear. (FORM, Items 2 and 8)\nAs of May 2007, there were at least two active warrants for Applicant\u2019s arrest.\nFor \u201cfailure to pay\u201d (SOR \u00b6 1.b) and \u201cfailure to answer\u201d (SOR \u00b6 1.c). (FORM, Item 9) In\nhis response to DOHA interrogatories in May 2007, he claimed he was unaware of the\nwarrants. Applicant indicated in response to the SOR that both warrants \u201cshould be\ntaken care of on Sept. 20, 07 (sic).\u201d However, the record contains no information to\nsupport or even explain the charges, and Applicant has submitted no further information\nshowing the warrants have been resolved.\nWhen Applicant submitted his e-QIP (FORM, Item 4), he answered \u201cno\u201d to all of\nthe questions in section 23 (record of arrests) (SOR \u00b6 3.a). In response to DOHA\ninterrogatories asking why he omitted his 1995 DWI arrest and conviction from the e-\nQIP, Applicant stated he thought that arrest was no longer on his record. Applicant also\nanswered \u201cno\u201d to e-QIP section 27 (financial record in the preceding seven years) and\nsection 28 (debts greater than 90 or 180 days past due) (SOR \u00b6 3.b). In response to\nDOHA interrogatories which asked why he omitted his debts and repossessions from\nthe e-QIP, he blamed his ex-wife for the debts, and cited his pending divorce for his\nassertion he did not know about the debts when he completed the form. (FORM, Item 8)\nPolicies\nEach security clearance decision must be a fair, impartial, and commonsense\ndetermination based on examination of all available relevant and material information,\nand consideration of the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in the Revised\nAdjudicative Guidelines (AG).  Decisions must also reflect consideration of the factors\n4\nlisted in \u00b6 2(a) of the new guidelines. Commonly referred to as the \u201cwhole person\u201d\nconcept, these factor are:\n\n See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988).\n5\n See Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, 531.\n6\n See Egan; Revised Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 2(b).\n7\n4\n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nThe presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not\ndeterminative of a conclusion for or against an applicant. However, specific applicable\nguidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against them as they\nrepresent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to classified\ninformation. In this case, the pleadings and the information presented by the parties\nrequire consideration of the security concerns and adjudicative factors addressed under\nGuideline E (personal conduct) at AG \u00b6 15, Guideline F (financial considerations) at AG\n\u00b6 18, and Guideline J (criminal conduct) at AG \u00b6 30.\nA security clearance decision is intended to resolve whether it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest  for an applicant to either receive or continue to\n5\nhave access to classified information. The government bears the initial burden of\nproducing admissible information on which it based the preliminary decision to deny or\nrevoke a security clearance for an applicant. Additionally, the government must be able\nto prove controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If the government meets its burden, it\nthen falls to the applicant to refute, extenuate or mitigate the government\u2019s case.\nBecause no one has a \u201cright\u201d to a security clearance, an applicant bears a heavy\nburden of persuasion.  A person who has access to classified information enters into a\n6\nfiduciary relationship with the government based on trust and confidence. Therefore, the\ngovernment has a compelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the\nrequisite judgement, reliability and trustworthiness of one who will protect the national\ninterests as his or her own. The \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard\ncompels resolution of any reasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in\nfavor of the government.7\nAnalysis\nCriminal Conduct. \nApplicant\u2019s criminal conduct may be a security concern because, as stated in AG\n\u00b6 30, \n\n5\n[c]riminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability and\ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person's ability\nor willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations.\nAvailable information is sufficient to support the allegations that he engaged in criminal\nconduct in April 1995 when he was arrested and convicted for DWI. However, the\ninformation in support of the allegations that as of May 2007 there were two outstanding\nwarrants for his arrest on charges of failure to answer and failure to pay is insufficient to\nprove criminal conduct. Nonetheless, his 1995 offense and the presence of the arrest\nwarrants require application of the disqualifying conditions at AG \u00b6 31(a) (a single\nserious crime or multiple lesser offenses) and AG \u00b6 31(c) (allegation or admission of\ncriminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was formally charged, formally\nprosecuted or convicted) (emphasis added).\nBy contrast, because the lone provable offense occurred more than 12 years\nago, Applicant is entitled to mitigation under AG \u00b6 32(a) (so much time has elapsed\nsince the criminal behavior happened, or it happened under such unusual\ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on the individual's\nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment) (emphasis added) The gravamen of this\ncase is in the security concerns about Applicant\u2019s finances and truthfulness, as\ndiscussed below. The security concerns presented by his criminal conduct are\nmitigated.\nFinancial Considerations.\nThe security concern about Applicant\u2019s finances, as stated in AG \u00b6 18, is that \n[f]ailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.\nApplicant has denied all of the SOR allegations about his past due debts, relying\non his assertion that his ex-wife is somehow responsible for the debts. However, the\ninformation presented by the OPM credit report is sufficient to support the SOR\nallegations. The same credit report also shows that all but one of the debts listed in the\nSOR is an individual account in his name alone. In response, Applicant has not\npresented any reliable information to show he has a reasonable basis for disputing his\ndebts or they are otherwise not his responsibility. Nor is there any available information\nto show he has acted to repay or otherwise resolve his debts. Accordingly, the record\nsupports application of the disqualifying conditions listed in AG \u00b6 19(a) (inability or\nunwillingness to satisfy debts) and AG \u00b6 19(c) (a history of not meeting financial\nobligations). Likewise, there is no support for any of the mitigating conditions listed at\nAG \u00b6 20. I conclude Applicant has not met his burden of producing information that\nwould mitigate the security concerns raised by the government\u2019s information about his\nfinances.\n\n See footnote 5, supra.\n8\n6\nPersonal Conduct.\nAs stated in AG \u00b6 15, \u201c[c]onduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor,\ndishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified\ninformation. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful and candid answers\nduring the security clearance process or any other failure to cooperate with the security\nclearance process.\u201d \nThe Applicant denied the allegations he intentionally omitted from the e-QIP his\n1995 DWI and his past due debts. As to his DWI, he explained that he thought his DWI\nwas no longer on his record, thus implying he thought he did not have to list it. Under\nsome circumstances and with additional corroborating information, such an explanation\nmight support a conclusion that his omission was unintentional. However, that omission\ncan not be viewed in isolation. It must be evaluated along with his omission of adverse\ninformation about his finances. Applicant claims his ex-wife is to blame for his\ndelinquencies and that he was unaware he had such debts. Without more, his\nexplanation is not plausible. \nAll of the available information probative of this issue leads me to conclude\nApplicant knowingly gave false answers in his SF 86 and that he was trying to mislead\nthe government about adverse information in his background. The foregoing requires\napplication of the disqualifying condition at AG \u00b6 16(a) (deliberate omission,\nconcealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any personnel security questionnaire,\npersonal history statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine\nemployment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance\neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities). \nThe government satisfied its burden of producing sufficient reliable evidence to\nsupport SOR \u00b6\u00b6 3.a and 3.b. In response, Applicant has submitted no information that\nwould support application of any of the mitigating conditions under this guideline.\nAccordingly, he has not mitigated the security concerns about his personal conduct. \nWhole Person Concept. \nI have evaluated the facts presented and have applied the appropriate\nadjudicative factors under Guidelines E, F, and J. I have also reviewed the record\nbefore me in the context of the whole person factors listed in AG \u00b6 2(a). Aside from\ninformation about his age, education, and employment history contained in his SF 86,\nthere is nothing on which to base application of any of these factors. Applicant is 49\nyears old and must be presumed to be a mature adult. However, there is no available\ninformation about his circumstances that would support application of any of the\nremaining whole person factors. A fair and commonsense assessment  of all of\n8\navailable information bearing on Applicant\u2019s finances and candor shows there are\ndoubts about his ability or willingness to protect the government\u2019s interests. Because\n\n See footnote 8, supra. \n9\n7\nthe protection of the national interest is paramount in these determinations, these\ndoubts must be resolved in favor of the national interest.9\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by section\nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Criminal Conduct\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.c\nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Financial Considerations: AGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 2.a - 2.k:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 3, Personal Conduct:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 3.a - 3.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the foregoing, it is not clearly consistent with the national interest\nto grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance.

MASON\nAPPEARANCES\nFOR GOVERNMENT\nJohn B. Glendon, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nSYNOPSIS\nBy launching her Chapter 13 bankruptcy plan in February 2007 before she officially received\nnotice her security clearance application was in jeopardy, and by substantiating seven regular\npayments under the plan, Applicant has exercised good judgment in demonstrating she is serious\nabout eradicating her financial troubles. Her persuasive character evidence tells me she will\nsuccessfully complete the plan while taking the appropriate steps to ensure the financial setbacks do\nnot recur. Clearance is granted. \nSTATEMENT OF CASE\n\n2\nOn March 30, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, dated January 2, 1992, as revised by Adjudicative\nGuidelines (AG) made effective on September 1, 2006, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the\nApplicant. The SOR indicated that based on financial considerations (Guideline F), DOHA could\nnot make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. DOHA recommended\nreferral to an Administrative Judge to conduct proceedings and determine whether clearance should\nbe granted, continued, denied or revoked. On April 24, 2007, Applicant provided her response to the\nSOR and requested a hearing before an Administrative Judge. \nThe case was assigned to me on July 16, 2007. On August 6, 2007, this case was set for\nhearing on September 12, 2007. The Government submitted six  exhibits. Applicant submitted two\nexhibits. In addition to her testimony, four witnesses testified in her behalf. The transcript (Tr.) was\nreceived on September 26, 2007. \nFINDINGS OF FACT\nThere are 11 creditors listed in the SOR. Seven of the creditors are medical facilities or\ncollection agencies representing the facilities. Four are credit cards or jewelry stores. The debts total\n$10,658.00. Applicant admitted all debts, and considered her son\u2019s medical difficulties, her medical\nproblems, and the trouble she encountered during her first marriage to be the primary reasons for her\ndebts becoming delinquent. The listed debts became delinquent between October 2001 and August\n2003. \nApplicant is 37 years old and employed has been an administrative assistant with a defense\ncontractor since November 2006. Before her current employment, she was an acquisition specialist\nwith another defense contractor for approximately two and \u00bd years. She has been married since\nMarch 2005. She has one child, 11 years old.\n! 1.a. Applicant opened the credit card account in February 2002. The account was charged\noff in November 2004. In February 2007, the account was delinquent in the amount of $2,006.00.\n! 1.b. Applicant opened a second credit card (same company) in May 2002. That account\nwas charged off in November 2004. The current, delinquent amount owed is $1,735.00. Both\naccounts 1.a. and 1.b. are included in Applicant\u2019s Chapter 13 plan (GE 5; AE A). The only accounts\nnot included are the two described in subparagraphs 1.j. and 1.k.\n! 1.c. Applicant opened the mail-order catalog account in October 2001. The account\n($1,224.00, currently held by a collection agency) was charged off in December 2003, and is listed\nin the Chapter 13 plan (GE 5; AE A)\n! 1.d. This delinquent bill represents the cost of medical treatment for Applicant\u2019s son who\nwas hospitalized in November 2004 for five days because of a sinus infection. The past due amount\nis $1,963.00.\n\n3\n! 1.e. Dental surgery for Applicant\u2019s son occurred in April 2002 and cost $1055.00. \n! 1.f. Applicant owes $901.00 for the anesthesia her son received in advance of dental\nsurgery in April 2002. \n! 1.g. Applicant received medical surgery June 2002, costing $804.00 for a hysterectomy.\n! 1.h. This debt ($666.00) is the physician\u2019s fee for conducting the hysterectomy. \n! 1.i. Applicant\u2019s son caught a common virus that most children get. The listed bill ($134.00)\nrepresents the cost of her son\u2019s hospitalization for one night. \n! 1.j. Though Applicant could not identify this bill at the hearing, she admitted the bill in her\nanswer to the SOR. GE 4 (credit bureau report, CBR) reflects the bill is for medical services\nrendered in July 2002.\n! 1.k. Although Applicant admitted the debt in her answer to the SOR, she did not know\nwhat the debt was for. She told the investigator that the $45.00 may have been for a cable service\nshe had while she lived in a neighboring state. The debt does not appear in her Chapter 13 petition\nbecause she did not know about the debt until she received the package from DOHA in April 2007.\nShe talked to her former husband about the bill, but he did not know anything about the bill. She can\ncertainly pay the debt.\nApplicant married in September 1996 and gave birth to a son in July 1997. In April 1998, her\nhusband took a temporary work assignment in another state, and Applicant moved with him. The job\nwas only supposed to last only six months but did not end until two years later. Instead of selling\ntheir marital home, they rented it. Apparently, the rental payments and unreliable renters contributed\nto a mortgage shortfall they could not recover from.\nAfter they returned to their permanent duty location in the summer of 2000, they fell further\nbehind on the mortgage and other debts. Adding to increasing financial problems was a deteriorating\nmarriage and Applicant\u2019s unanticipated health issues requiring surgery. In early 2002, Applicant\u2019s\nhusband moved out and her father died in October 2002. Applicant\u2019s divorce from her first husband\nin January 2003 required her to pay all marital debt that included her own medical bills and most of\nher son\u2019s medical bills and insurance. Even though she was not ignoring the listed debt, her primary\nconcern was covering the rent, utilities and expenses related to raising a child. \nIn early 2004, she began working for a defense contractor that provided her with earning and\npromotion potential. She also started dating her present husband at a later point in 2004, and they\nwere married in March 2005. In November 2006, Applicant came to work for her current employer\nand received a substantial increase in earnings. In the same month, she received documentation from\nDOHA advising her that her security clearance application was being questioned due to overdue\ndebts. \nShe contacted a bankruptcy attorney and a Chapter 13 bankruptcy petition was filed in\nFebruary 2007. The terms of the petition require Applicant to pay $1,732.10 every month for 24\n\n4\nmonths. All creditors except subparagraph 1.j. and 1.k. are included in the plan. Applicant has made\nseven payments under the plan. Before she was able to file the Chapter 13 petition, she was required\nto attend financial counseling which she successfully completed in January 2007. The counseling,\nrequired under the bankruptcy laws, consisted of understanding, establishing and maintaining a\nbudget. \nApplicant\u2019s current supervisor explained that Applicant\u2019s job includes tracking funds so that\nthe command can know how much money is being spent on the various programs. Based on his\nknowledge of Applicant\u2019s work product, her supervisor strongly recommends her for a position of\ntrust. \nApplicant\u2019s program manager advised that her performance evaluation (November 2007) will\ncontain outstanding ratings. Applicant told the program manager about her financial problems when\nshe was hired. He believes she is on the right track to resolve those problems and get on with her life.\nApplicant\u2019s past supervisor from 2004 until her hire in November 2006 was impressed with\nhow she managed her time on assignments. Her trustworthiness, reliability, and self-starter attitude\nare three reasons the past supervisor recommends her for a position of trust. \nApplicant\u2019s former coworker believes Applicant is one of the most honest individuals. The\nformer coworker is confident Applicant will correct her financial problems.\nIn a character statement dated April 26, 2007, Applicant\u2019s security officers have found her\nto be open about her financial problems. On April 27, 2007, the Commander (in a character\nstatement) of a project that employs Applicant has found her to be dependable. On April 24, 2007,\nthe task leader found Applicant to be a delight to work with. Her desire to broaden her education and\npromotion potential, according to the task leader, is unsurpassed. \nThe electrical engineer provided impressive compliments about Applicant on April 20, 2007.\nThe engineer has an understanding of her past due debts, but believes she has executed the proper\nsteps to get those debts paid. The procurement officer hired to take Applicant\u2019s place at her former\njob in November 2006 recounted the thoroughness in which Applicant trained her. The officer now\nunderstands why Applicant was promoted. \nPOLICIES\nThe AG contains disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) that should\nbe given binding consideration in making security clearance determinations. These conditions must\nbe considered in every case along with the general factors of the whole person concept. However,\nthe conditions are not automatically determinative of the decision in any case nor can they supersede\nthe Administrative Judge's reliance on his own common sense. \nBurden of Proof\nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, that conditions exist in the\n\n5\npersonal or professional history of the applicant which disqualifies, or may disqualify, the applicant\nfrom being eligible for access to classified information. See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484\nU.S. 518, 531 (1988) \u201c[T]he Directive presumes there is a nexus or rational connection between\nproven conduct under any of the Criteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability.\u201d ISCR\nCase No. 95-0611 at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996) (quoting DISCR Case No. 92-1106 (App. Bd. Oct.\n7, 1993)). \nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial evidence, the\nburden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts. \u201c[S]ecurity clearance\ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d See Egan, 481 U.S. at 531; see\nDirective E2.2.2.\nFinancial Considerations (FC)\nThe failure to pay debts in a timely manner places an individual at risk of committing acts\nof poor judgment to generate funds.\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe records discloses that Applicant has 11 overdue debts that have not been paid. The debts,\nwhich total more than $10,600.00, became delinquent between October 2001 and August 2003. FC\ndisqualifying condition (DC) 19.a. (inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts) and FC DC 19c. (a\nhistory of not meeting financial obligations) apply based on Applicant\u2019s inability to pay the debts\nthat are up to five years old. \nAlthough the government has established a case under the FC guideline, Applicant has\nsuccessfully mitigated the adverse evidence. First, there were circumstances outside her control that\nexacerbated her financial problems. FC mitigating condition MC  20.b. (the conditions that resulted\nin the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control) applies. The unexpected period\nof time she and her first husband had to stay at the temporary duty location (1998 to the summer of\n2000) caused them to fall behind in their mortgage. Her unanticipated medical problem in September\n2001, followed by her father\u2019s sudden death in October 2002, were clearly two occurrences beyond\nher control, combined with the ongoing medical problems of her son. Aggravating her overall\nfinancial instability was her husband\u2019s demand for a divorce, and the final terms of the divorce\nrequiring her to pay all the marital debt and most of the medical obligations for herself and her son.\nSignificantly, the listed debts all became delinquent during the periods between October 2001 and\nAugust 2003. \nApplicant received some counseling in January 2007 in advance of her Chapter 13 petition\nbecoming effective. Since her plan was accepted by the Bankruptcy court in February 2007,\nApplicant has been utilizing a budget in her financial affairs. FC MC 20.c. (the person has received\nor is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is\nbeing resolved or is under control) applies. In addition to some evidence of counseling, Applicant\nhas made seven payments (almost $13,000.00) under the plan. Even though Applicant\u2019s repayment\nof her creditors is being made through a Chapter 13 petition, the mode of repayment still represents\n\n6\nfavorable evidence under 20.d. (the individual has initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue\ncreditors or otherwise resolve debts) Applicant\u2019s strong character evidence, together with the\nfavorable mitigating evidence under FC MC 20.b. and FC MC 20.d. warrant findings for Applicant\nunder subparagraphs 1.a. through 1.i. I am firmly convinced Applicant will exercise the same good\njudgment to resolve the debts in subparagraphs 1.j. and 1.k. The FC guideline is resolved in\nApplicant\u2019s favor. \nMy findings for Applicant under the whole person concept are the same as they are under the\nFC guideline. The sterling character ratings Applicant has received from individuals who have\nobserved her for up to three years convince me Applicant will (1) maintain payments under her\nChapter 13 plan until successful completion of the plan, and (2) maintain her budget so that she can\ncontinue to stay on top of her finances at home exactly as she has at work. \nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal Findings required by Paragraph 25 of Enclosure 3 are:\nParagraph 1 (Financial Considerations, Guideline F): \nFOR THE APPLICANT.\nSubparagraphs 1.a. through 1.k. \nFor the Applicant. \nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. Clearance is\ngranted. \nPaul J. Mason\nAdministrative Judge\n",

BRESLIN\nAPPEARANCES\nFOR GOVERNMENT\nEric H. Borgstrom, Esq. Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\n\n2\nSYNOPSIS\nApplicant is a software engineer for a defense contractor.  He unlawfully used marijuana and\na prescription drug on multiple occasions between about 2002 and 2006, while a college student and\na summer intern, and reported it on his security clearance application.  Since then, he no longer\nassociates with people involved with illegal drugs, and no longer lives in a college dormitory where\nhis drug abuse occurred.  He indicated his willingness to execute a statement of intent with automatic\nrevocation of his clearance for any violation.  However, his drug abuse was so extensive and\ncontinued for so long that not enough time has passed to demonstrate successful rehabilitation.\nApplicant failed to mitigate the security concerns arising from his history of drug involvement.\nClearance is denied.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn August 30, 2006, Applicant submitted an application for a security clearance.  The\nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a security clearance\nfor Applicant under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry\n(Feb. 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel\nSecurity Clearance Review Program (Jan. 2, 1992) (the \u201cDirective\u201d), as amended; and the new\nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and implemented\nby the Department of Defense on September 1, 2006.  On March 23, 2007, DOHA issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its decision: security concerns raised under the\nDirective, Guideline H, Drug Involvement.  \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on April 7, 2007.  He elected to have the matter\ndecided without a hearing.\nDepartment Counsel submitted the government\u2019s case in a File of Relevant Material (FORM)\ndated June 4, 2007.  On June 15, 2007, Department Counsel mailed a complete copy of the FORM\nto Applicant, along with notice of his opportunity to file objections and submit material to refute,\nextenuate, or mitigate the potentially disqualifying conditions.  On July 20, 2007, Applicant\nsubmitted an additional response for consideration.  The case was assigned to me on August 13,\n2007. \nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant admitted the allegations in the SOR, with explanations.  (Item 2; Item 5.)  Those\nadmissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact.  After a complete and thorough review of the\nevidence in the record, I make the following additional findings of fact.\nApplicant is 23 years old.  (Item 3 at 1.)  He is an embedded systems software engineer for\na defense contractor.  (Id. at 3.)  He was an Eagle Scout and a high achiever in high school. \nApplicant attended college between about September 2002 and May 2006.  (Id. at 3.)  Friends\noffered him marijuana and he smoked it; at first his use was experimental, but gradually he became\na regular user.  (Item 5 at 2.)  According to Applicant, his heaviest use occurred during his freshman\n\n3\nand sophomore years.  (Id.)  He estimates that he used marijuana between 25 and 60 times.  (Id.)\nApplicant asserts he used marijuana only twice while home from college.  (Item 5 at 2.)  His\nmarijuana use tapered off after 2004.  \nApplicant purchased a small quantity of marijuana (about one gram) for his personal use on\ntwo occasions in his sophomore or junior year.  (Item 5 at 2; Additional Response at 2.)  He had\nfriends who sold marijuana; one two occasions he helped them make transfers, but did not receive\nany profit.  (Item 5 at 2.)  \nOn approximately six occasions between 2002 and 2006, Applicant purchased Adderall, an\namphetamine-based prescription medication, at a total cost of about $50.00.  He used the drug,\nwithout a prescription, to stay awake to study for final exams and to attend parties.  \nWhile he was still in college, Applicant worked as a student engineer/intern for a major\ndefense contractor between May and August 2005.  (Item 3 at 4.)  He reported his last use of\nmarijuana occurred in March 2006.  (Item 5 at 2.)  \nIn August 2006, Applicant began working for a defense contractor.  (Item 5 at 3.)  On August\n30, 2006, Applicant completed an SF 86, Security Clearance Application.  (Item 3.)  He reported\nusing marijuana drugs during college as follows: three times during his freshman year; 30-40 times\nduring the Spring of his sophomore year; once a  month during his junior year; and 4-5 times during\nhis senior year.  He admitted helping friends with sales of marijuana on two occasions.  He also\nreported using Adderall without a prescription about 7 times, as a study aid and as recreation.  (Item\n3 at 9-10.)  \nApplicant states he no longer associates with individuals involved in using or selling illegal\ndrugs, and that he has no intention of ever being involved in the use, purchase, or sale of illegal drugs\nin the future.  (Additional Response, at 2.)  He indicated his willingness to execute a statement of\nintent with automatic revocation of his clearance for any violation.  \nPOLICIES\nThe President has \u201cthe authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national\nsecurity and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position \u2026\nthat will give that person access to such information.\u201d  Department of the Navy v.

An administrative judge should consider the\nfollowing factors: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances\nsurrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of\nthe conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which\nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral\nchanges; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  (Id.) \nInitially, the government must present evidence to establish controverted facts in the SOR\nthat disqualify or may disqualify the applicant from being eligible for access to classified\ninformation.  (Directive, \u00b6 E3.1.14.)  Thereafter, the applicant is responsible for presenting evidence\nto rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts.  (Directive, \u00b6 E3.1.15.)  An applicant \u201chas the\nultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or\ncontinue his security clearance.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002).  \u201cAny\ndoubt as to whether access to classified information is clearly consistent with national security will\nbe resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d  (Directive, \u00b6 E2.2.2.)\nA person granted access to classified information enters into a special relationship with the\ngovernment.  The government must be able to repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those\nindividuals to whom it grants access to classified information.  The decision to deny an individual\na security clearance is not a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  (Exec. Ord. 10865, \u00a7\n7.)  It is merely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President has\nestablished for issuing a clearance.\nCONCLUSIONS\nI considered carefully all the facts in evidence and the legal standards discussed above.  I\nreach the following conclusions regarding the allegations in the SOR.\nGuideline H, Drug Involvement\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Drug Involvement is set out in \u00b6 24 of the\nnew adjudicative guidelines.  \nUse of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise questions about an\nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because it may impair judgment and\nbecause it raises questions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with\nlaws, rules, and regulations. \n\u201cDrug abuse\u201d is defined as \u201cthe illegal use of a drug or the use of a legal drug in a manner that\ndeviates from approved medical direction.\u201d  (AG, \u00b6 24(b).)\n\n5\nUnder  \u00b6 25(a) of the Directive, \u201cany drug abuse\u201d is potentially disqualifying.  Applicant\nadmitted wrongfully using marijuana, an illegal drug, and abusing Adderall, a prescription\nmedication, on multiple occasions while a college student and a summer intern for a defense\ncontractor between about 2002 and 2006.  The evidence raises this potentially disqualifying\ncondition.\nParagraph 25(c) of the Directive provides that \u201cillegal drug possession, including cultivation,\nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution\u201d may raise security concerns.  Applicant\nadmitted purchasing marijuana two times and buying Adderall for his personal use on about six\noccasions.  He also helped friends complete sales of marijuana on two other occasions, although he\ndid not receive a profit.  The evidence also raises this potentially disqualifying condition.\nUnder the Directive, it is possible to mitigate the security concerns arising from involvement\nwith illegal drugs.  Paragraph 26(a) may apply where \u201cthe behavior happened so long ago, was so\ninfrequent, or happened under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt\non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d  In this case, Applicant\u2019s\nuse of illegal drugs was relatively recent; he stopped using marijuana in about March 2006 and\napplied for a security clearance in August 2006.  Moreover, his usage was not \u201cinfrequent,\u201d\nconsidering his reported usage during his sophomore and junior years of college.  He used illegal\ndrugs for so long that it cannot be fairly described as experimentation or a result of unusual\ncircumstances.  Considering all the evidence, I conclude this potentially mitigating condition does\nnot apply.\nUnder \u00b6 26(b), it may be mitigating where the evidence shows \u201ca demonstrated intent not to\nabuse any drugs in the future,\u201d such as:\n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts;\n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used;\n(3) an appropriate period of abstinence;\n(4) a signed statement of intent with automatic revocation of clearance for any\nviolation.\nTo his credit, Applicant indicated he no longer associates with people involved with illegal drugs,\nand he no longer lives in a college dormitory where his drug abuse occurred.  Additionally, he\nindicated his willingness to execute a statement of intent with automatic revocation of his clearance\nfor any violation.  These factors tend to support this potentially mitigating factor.  I am not\npersuaded, however, that an appropriate period of abstinence has passed; I note Applicant used\nmultiple drugs for about four years, and continued using marijuana even after he worked as a student\nintern for a defense contractor during the summer of 2005.  The period of abstinence is relatively\nshort by comparison.\nWhole Person Concept\n\n6\nI considered carefully all the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in this case\nin light of the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept, keeping in mind that any doubt as to whether access to\nclassified information is clearly consistent with national security must be resolved in favor of\nnational security.  Applicant\u2019s admissions reveal a pattern of substantial drug abuse, continuing for\nabout four years.  Applicant has not presented any evidence of completion of a drug rehabilitation\nprogram, nor is his period of abstinence long enough to demonstrate a significant behavioral change.\nConsidering all the evidence, I conclude Applicant has not met his burden of demonstrating that it\nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him a security clearance.  Although the\nevidence of Applicant\u2019s rehabilitation is insufficient at this time, with the passage of more time,\ncontinued good duty performance, and no further incidents of drug abuse, he may demonstrate\npersuasive evidence of his security worthiness.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nMy conclusions as to each allegation in the SOR are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline H:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a-e:\nAgainst Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.\nClearance is denied.\nMichael J.

SAX\nAPPEARANCES\nFOR GOVERNMENT\nJennifer I. Goldstein, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nSYNOPSIS\nApplicant is a highly educated 43 year old Programmer Analyst who was born in Jordan in\n1964, and met her future American-born husband while here for a college program in 1992. She\nmoved here, married, and completed her MBA in 1995.  She became a U.S. citizen in 2002. She has\nrenounced her Jordanian citizenship and surrendered her expired Jordanian passport.  Her elderly\nmother and sisters are still citizens and residents of Jordan. He closet ties are with her mother.  She\nhas no other emotional, financial, or other ties to Jordan. Her ties to the U.S. are both deep and\nstrong.  She credibly avers prompt reporting of any inappropriate contacts regardless of the source.\nMitigation has been established. Clearance is granted. \n\n2\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\n \nOn July 11, 20075, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to\nExecutive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2,\n1992, as amended, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant. The SOR detailed reasons\nwhy DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding required under the Directive that it\nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the\nApplicant. The SOR recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to conduct proceedings and\ndetermine whether a clearance should be granted, denied or revoked. \nOn July 25, 2007, Applicant responded to the allegations set forth in the SOR, and elected\nto have a decision made by a DOHA Administrative Judge after a hearing. The case was assigned\nto me on September 11, 2007. A Notice of Hearing was issued on September 20, 2007, setting the\nhearing for October 4, 2007. The Government introduced four (4) exhibits (Government\u2019s Exhibits\n(GX) 1 - 4). The Government also introduced seven (7) Official Notice documents (ON I-VII).\nApplicant testified, and introduced four (4\n/ exhibits. (Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AX) A - E). Applicant also introduced four post hearing exhibits\n(AX F-I) and a series of Official Notice documents (App ON I, and 1A - 1.S). Some of the\nApplicant\u2019s offered Official Notice documents do not qualify as such and, although not admitted as\nsuch, have been considered as hearsay documents that provide some insight, but have not influenced\nthe outcome of this decision. The transcript was received on October, 2007. \nFINDINGS OF FACT \nApplicant is a 42-year-old Programmer/Analyst for a defense contractor. The SOR contains\nseven (7) allegations under Guideline B (Foreign Influence) and two (2) allegations under Guideline\nC (Foreign Preference). Applicant admits all allegations, which are accepted and incorporated herein\nas Findings of Fact.  \n1\nAfter considering the totality of the evidence, I make the following additional FINDINGS\nOF FACT as to the status of each SOR allegation. \nGuideline B (Foreign Influence) \n1.a. - Applicant\u2019s 69 year old mother is a citizen and resident of Jordan. \n1.b., 1.c., 1.e., and 1.f. - Applicant\u2019s sisters are citizens and residents of Jordan. \n1.g.- Applicant traveled to Jordan from December 26, 2000 to January 8, 2001, at which time\nshe was not yet a U.S. citizen. \n1.h. - Applicant traveled to Jordan from December 26, 2003 to January 8, 2004, during which\nperiod she was a U.S. citizen. She used the Jordanian passport in 2003 for \"convenience\" and to\navoid having to obtain a Jordanian visa (GX 2). She visited Jordan once more in 2007, with her\nhusband. This time she had some Jordanian money and purchased a visa to use with her U.S.\npassport (Tr at 83). \n\n3\nGuideline C (Foreign Preference) \n2.a. - Applicant held dual U.S.-Jordanian citizenship, by virtue of her birth in that country\nto Jordanian citizens.  She has renounced her Jordanian citizenship by letter to the Embassy of\nJordan in Washington, D.C. (Tr at 83-85, AX F, G, and H). \n2.b. - Applicant used her Jordanian passport to travel to Jordan after becoming a U.S. citizen\non August 15, 2002 and receiving a U.S. passport on August 23, 2002, as detailed in paragraph 1.h.,\nabove. On the latter occasion she attempted to use her U.S. passport, but was told by Jordanian\nauthorities at the airport that she would need a visa that could be paid for only in Jordanian money.\nShe did not have any and it was available only in another section of the airport. Her elderly\nmother was waiting for her, so she decided to avoid any problem or delays by using her Jordanian\npassport. Under these circumstances, I find no suggestion that she acted out of any preference for\nJordan over the United States. She has used her U.S. passport for all other travel.  The passport\nexpired in October 2005 and has not been renewed. She destroyed the Jordanian passport in the\npresence of the Facility Security Officer at her employing company (AX F and I). \nHer mother and sisters are in good financial condition and do not need any help from\nApplicant. None of them are connected with the Jordanian government and Applicant does not\nbelieve they are in position to be exploited in such a way as to force Applicant to choose between\nthem and the U.S. as to security related matters. \nApplicant has consistently and credibly averred that \"fact that my mother and sisters are\noutside the U.S. does in no way affect my maturity or loyalty. I firmly believe in work ethics, trust,\nand responsibility. I take my job seriously and I will not, and didn\u2019t at any time, let my relationship\nwith family or friends to interfere with my judgment or duties\" (Response to SOR). \n\"I state that while my mother is my tie to Jordan, my ties to the United States are numerous.\nThey include my country, my family, my friends, my work, our financial assets, retirements, pension,\nand social security benefits. I consider myself to be fortunate and proud to be a citizen of this country\nand as loyal as an American born citizen\" (AX F). \nHer husband is a university professor. They own a condominium deeded to them by the\nuniversity. He was present at the hearing. Other than her family, she has no friends in Jordan. \nHer Project Manager and other colleagues praise her as reliable, professional, dedicated, of\nhigh character, security conscious in handling classified information, a \"strict follower\" of \"company\nsecurity policies,\u201d and \"excited about becoming a U.S. citizen.\" Her father-in-law, who held a \"Q\"\nclearance for many years, avers that \"her primary loyalty is, and would, be to the United States.\u201d \nPOLICIES \nViewed in an overall context, under E2.2.3.of the Directive, the ultimate determination of\nwhether the granting or continuing of eligibility for a security clearance is clearly consistent with the\ninterests of national security must be an overall common sense determination based upon careful\nconsideration of the following, each of which is to be evaluated in the context of the whole person.\nExplained further below (emphasis added): \n\n4\nThe Whole Person Concept: Under E2.2.1., the DoD adjudicative process is an examination\nof a sufficient period of a person's life to make an affirmative determination that the person is\neligible for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is predicated upon\nthe individual meeting these personnel security guidelines. The adjudicative process is the careful\nweighing of a number of variables known as the whole person concept. Available, reliable\ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be considered in\nreaching a determination. \nIn evaluating the relevance of an individual's conduct, the adjudicator should consider the\nfollowing factors: 1. The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; 2. The circumstances\nsurrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; 3. The frequency and recency of\nthe conduct; 4. The individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; 5. The voluntariness of\nparticipation; 6. The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavioral changes;\nThe motivation for the conduct; 8. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and\n9. The likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nCONCLUSIONS \nApplicant is a 42-year-old \"Programmer Analyst.\" (Tr at 55). Born in Jordan in December\n1964, she worked for the Ministry of Tourism in 1982-1983 as a typist. She first came to the U.S.\nin 1992 to attend a six-month program. During that period, she met her future husband, a native-born\nU.S. citizen. She began thinking about emigrating to the United States and arrived in 1995, at which\ntime they were married (Tr at 57, 86). She received a MBA in 1997, and became a naturalized U.S.\ncitizen in August 2002 (Tr at 58). She has telephone contact with her family in Jordan every two or\nthree months and visits them in Jordan every two or three years. She and her husband have a\n\"household net worth\" of about $1.4 million (GX 2) \nForeign Influence - The concern is that \"Foreign contacts and interests maybe a security\nconcern if the individual has divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or\ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way that is not in U.S.\ninterests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Adjudication under this\nGuideline can and should consider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact\nor financial interest is located , including but not limited to such considerations as whether the\nforeign country is known to target U.S. citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated\nwith a risk of terrorism. \nThe concern stated in the SOR relates to (1) Applicant\u2019s mother and sisters being citizens and\nresidents of Jordan, and (2) her travel to Jordan twice between December 2000 and January 2004,\nprimarily to visit her elderly mother. This information was originally provided by Applicant in her\nsecurity clearance application of December 15, 2005, and expanded upon in her answers to\ninterrogatories of April 16, 2007. On both these occasions and at the October 4, 2007 hearing, she\ndisplayed no reticence in describing her feelings about her mother. At the same time, she was\nimpressive in expressing her feelings about her family and life in America and her dedication to this\ncountry, as has been corroborated by her career in service to the national defense effort. \n\n5\nDisqualifying Condition(s) (DC) \n8. (a) contact with a foreign family member, business or professional associate, friend, or\nother person who is a citizen of or resident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened\nrisk of foreign exploitation, inducement, pressure, or coercion. None other apply. \nMitigating Conditions(s) (MC). Applicable are: \n8.(a) the nature of th relationships with foreign persons, the country in which these persons\nare located, or the positions or activities of those persons in that country are such that it is unlikely\nthe individual will be placed in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign\nindividual, group, organization, or government and the United States; and \n8.(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of loyalty or\nobligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country is so minimal, or the individual has\nsuch deep and long-standing relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the individual can\nbe expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of th United States. \nGuideline C (Foreign Preference), the stated concerns are her \"dual citizenship\" with Jordan\nane her use of the Jordanian passport in 2003/2004, as discussed above under Findings of Fact,\nabove. The security concern occurs when an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference\nfor a foreign country over the United States, then he or she may be prone to provide information or\nmake decisions that are harmful to the interests of the United States. \n2.a - Applicant\u2019s Jordanian citizenship was the result of her birth in Jordanian parents. She\nretained her Jordanian citizenship because she did not know it would be a problem. When she\nlearned that was the case, she promptly renounced that citizenship by letter to the Jordanian Embassy\nalong with her cut up Jordanian passport. \n2.b. - Her Jordanian passport was obtained before she became a U.S. citizen and therefore\ncannot be considered an act of preference for Jordan over the United States. Her use of the Jordanian\npassport on the one occasion cited in the SOR occurred after she tried to use her U.S. passport and\nout of concern for her elderly mother waiting for her elsewhere at the airport. She has recently\nrenounced her Jordanian citizenship by letter to the Jordanian Embassy and attaching the Jordanian\npassport she cut up in front of her company\u2019s facility security officer. Under these circumstances her\nconduct did not indicate any preference for Jordan over the United States. The record does not reflect\nany conduct indicating a preference for Jordan. \nI understand the Government\u2019s concern with the mother and sisters in Jordan being at risk\nof being pressured to use whatever influence they may have on Applicant to act against U.S. security\ninterests. However, the real concern in Guideline B and C cases is that a person seeking or\npossessing a clearance might respond to such pressure by acting improperly and against U.S.\ninterests.\nDisqualifying Conditions \n10.(a) - exercise of any right, privilege, or obligation of foreign citizenship after becoming\na U.S. citizen or through the foreign citizenship of a family member: \n10(a)(1) Possession of a foreign passport. None other apply; \n\n6\nMitigating Conditions \n11.(a) dual citizenship is based solely on parents\u2019 citizenship or birth in a foreign country;\n11.(b) the individual has expressed a willingness to renounce dual citizenship [and has\nactually done so]. \n11.( e) the passport has been destroyed, surrendered to the cognizant security authority, or\notherwise invalidated. \nI have carefully considered the Government\u2019s exhibits and Official Notice documents. I\nunderstand the risks incurred by Applicant\u2019s family members being citizens and residents of Jordan.\nThis nation has traditionally been friendly to the United States, and is not cited in Official Notice\ndocuments as being active in espionage or the gathering of sensitive information. At the same time,\nthere are terrorist elements in Jordan that are a threat to foreigners, including U.S. citizens. I have\ntaken this reality into account in my evaluation and risk analysis. \nThe Government\u2019s evidence comes down to the presence in Jordan of her mother and sisters,\na situation about which she can do little or nothing.  Their status is not her choice. At the same time,\nthose relationships have survived for many years with Applicant living and working in the U.S., with\nno apparent security problems. \nWhile the lack of past problems does not mean there will be no problems in the future, it is\na positive factor that must be considered along with all other relevant information. Applicant\nunderstands her security obligations and promises to act appropriately. Such promises of future\nconduct may not be considered, by themselves, to be substantial evidence, they are augmented by\nApplicants long career in America\u2019s defense effort and the solidly positive opinions of those who\nhave known her over so any years. \nApplicant has a solid record of maturity, integrity, and service to her adopted country.\nDespite the risks that may exist solely because of her family members in Jordan, nothing in the\nrecord suggests that Applicant would even hesitate before doing the right thing, to instinctively\nprotect U.S. security interests. Under the specific facts and circumstances in this case, I conclude that\nadequate mitigation of the risk has been shown. \nFinally, in a recent case, the Appeal Board rejected the Government\u2019s contention that the\nAdministrative Judge\u2019s \"whole person analysis\" was unsustainable (ISCR Case No. 04-06564 (May\n30, 2006). The Appeal Board found that the Administrative Judge had restated some of the Guideline\nB mitigating factors and presented a reasonable explanation for her decision, given the relevant\nfactors in this case, making the favorable decision was sustainable. \nAfter a careful study of the Appeal Board decision, and the underlying decision of the\nAdministrative Judge, I conclude the facts and circumstances are substantially similar to those in the\npresent case as a rationale for the granting of a DoD security clearance.\n\n7\nFORMAL FINDINGS \nFormal Findings as required by Section 3, Paragraph 7 of Enclosure 1 of the Directive are\nhereby rendered as follows: \nGuideline B (Foreign Influence) \nSubparagraph 1.a. \n            For the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b. \nFor the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c. \n            For the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d. \nFor the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e. \n            For the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f.. \nFor the Applicant\nGuideline C (Foreign Preference)\nFor the Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.a. \n            For the Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b. \nFor the Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. \nBARRY M.

    "summary": "FINDINGS OF FACT In the SOR, the Government alleges concern under Adjudicative Guideline J (Criminal Conduct), Guideline E (Personal Conduct), and Guideline G (Alcohol Consumption) of the Directive. The SOR contains six allegations, 1.a. through 1.f., under Guideline J, one allegation, 2.a., under Guideline E, and one allegation, 3.a., under Guideline G. In her RSOR, Applicant admitted SOR allegations 1.a. through 1.e., and she denied 2.a., and 3.a. She failed to respond to1.f. The admitted allegations are incorporated herein as findings of fact.

MOGUL\nAPPEARANCES\nFOR GOVERNMENT\nJeff Nagel, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nSYNOPSIS\nApplicant's alcohol abuse has resulted in four alcohol-related incidents, the last occurring in\n2005. While Applicant continues to consume alcohol, she no longer consumes alcohol to excess, nor\ndoes she drive after consuming any alcohol. While Applicant furnished incomplete information to\nthe Government, it was not a wilful misrepresentation, but rather based on a misunderstanding.\nMitigation has been shown. A determination of trustworthiness and access to personal sensitive\ninformation is granted.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn April 9, 1993, the Composite Health Care Systems Program Office (CHCSPO), the\n\n2\nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), and the Assistant Secretary of Defense for\nCommand, Control, Communications and Intelligence (ASD C3I) entered into a memorandum of\nagreement for DOHA to provide trustworthiness determinations for contractor personnel employed\nin Information Systems Positions as defined in DoD Regulation 5200.2R, Personnel Security\nProgram (Regulation), dated January of 1987.\nOn July 11, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to\nExecutive Order 10865 (as amended) and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated\nJanuary 2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant, which detailed reasons why\nDOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a determination of trustworthiness,\nsuitability, and eligibility for the Applicant to hold a sensitive Systems Position (ADP-I/II/III).\nApplicant  filed a notarized response, dated August 17, 2007, to the allegations set forth in\nthe SOR (RSOR), and requested a hearing before a DOHA Administrative Judge. On October 9,\n2007, the case was assigned to this Administrative Judge to conduct a hearing. Pursuant to formal\nnotice, dated October 24, 2007, a hearing was held in Sacramento, California, on November 14,\n2007. \nAt the hearing, Department Counsel offered three documentary exhibits (Government\u2019s\nExhibits 1-3) and no witnesses were called. Applicant also offered three documentary exhibit\n(Applicant\u2019s Exhibits A-C) and offered her own testimony. The transcript (Tr) was received on\nNovember 28, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nIn the SOR, the Government alleges concern under Adjudicative Guideline J (Criminal\nConduct), Guideline E (Personal Conduct), and Guideline G (Alcohol Consumption) of the\nDirective. The SOR contains six allegations, 1.a. through 1.f., under Guideline J, one allegation, 2.a.,\n under Guideline E, and one allegation, 3.a., under Guideline G. In her RSOR, Applicant admitted\nSOR allegations 1.a. through 1.e., and she denied 2.a., and 3.a.   She failed to respond to1.f.  The\nadmitted allegations are incorporated herein as findings of fact. \nAfter a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, including Applicant's\nAnswer to the SOR, the admitted documents, and the testimony of Applicant, and upon due\nconsideration of that evidence, I make the additional findings of fact: \nApplicant is 27 years old. She is unmarried, and she has no children. Applicant is a customer\nService Representative for a defense contractor who seeks an ADP-I/II/III position on behalf of the\nApplicant.  \nParagraph 1 (Guideline J - Criminal Conduct)\nThe Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for access to personal\nsensitive information because she has engaged in criminal acts.\n\n3\n1.a.  Applicant was cited on January 12, 1997, and charged with Drunk in Public. She was\nplaced into a Diversion Program for this offense\n1.b.  Applicant was cited on March 17, 2001, and charged with (1) Possession of a False\nIdentification, and (2) Open Container/Drunk in Public. She plead Nolle Contendere to Count 2 and\nwas fined $210. Count 1 was dismissed. At the time of this incident Applicant was 20 years old, not\nof legal drinking age, but she used her sister\u2019s identification to purchase alcohol. She testified that\nthis was the only time she used her sister\u2019s identification for this purpose. \n1.c.  Applicant was cited on January 2, 2002, and charged with (1) Open Container, and (2)\nDrunk in Public. She was fined $75.\n1.d.  Applicant was cited on July 7, 2003, and charged with No Proof of Insurance. She was\nfined $331, but $130 of this fine was suspended after she provided proof of insurance. \nApplicant testified that she was involved in an automobile accident, with an automobile that\nshe had recently purchased. Unfortunately, on the day of this incident she drove the vehicle without\ninsurance, and she testified that this was the first day that she had driven the vehicle. She had been\nplanning to purchase insurance two days after the incident, when  she received her paycheck. \n1.e.  Applicant was arrested on June 27, 2005, and charged with Disorderly Conduct/Public\nIntoxication. She plead Guilty, and she was fined $350, and placed on one year probation. \nApplicant testified that this incident occurred when Applicant and some of her co-workers\nwent to a bar after work. She stated that she remembered having three mixed drinks and two beers.\nAfter that she has no recollection of the event. Applicant testified that she was informed that a police\nofficer found her crying on a street corner. The informal probation, upon which she was placed,\nconcluded without further incident.\n1.f. The Government alleges that Applicant\u2019s  conduct, which is alleged in paragraph 2., and\nwhich is discussed below, constitutes a violation of Federal Law, Title 18, United States Code,\nSection 1001, which is a felony. As discussed below, I find her conduct inadvertent due to a\nmisunderstanding, rather than wilful, so it does not constitute a violation of Title 18, United States\nCode, Section 1001.\nParagraph 2 (Guideline E - Personal Conduct) \n2.a. The Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for access to\npersonal sensitive information because when she completed a signed, sworn Public Trust Position\nApplication (PTPA) on June 20, 2006, (Exhibit 1), she furnished untruthful information to the\nGovernment. \nQuestion #16 asks,  \u201cIn the last 7 years, have you been arrested for, charged with of convicted\nof any offense(s)?\u201d Applicant answered \u201cYes\u201dand she listed her December 4, 2005, arrest for Public\nIntoxication, as cited in allegation 1.e., above. The Government alleges that Applicant should have\nlisted the incidents that have been cited and discussed, above, as allegations 1.b., 1.c., and 1.d.\nApplicant responded to interrogatories (Exhibit 2) and testified credibly that she believed the\n\n4\nquestion only concerned arrests for misdemeanors and felonies, and since the four incidents listed\nas 1.b., 1.c., and 1.d. only involved citations not arrests, she believed that she answered the question\ncorrectly by not including them. Applicant did include the most recent and most serious offense, the\n2005 Disorderly Conduct/Public Intoxication arrest, which is by far the most damaging incident with\nthe legal authorities, and also which is consistent with her explanation that she believed only arrests\nwere to be included. Had she wanted to mislead the Government to improve her record, that\nDisorderly Conduct/Public Intoxication would have been the one to omit from her application.\nTherefore, I am persuaded that her incorrect response to this question was as a result of a\nmisunderstanding, not an attempt to mislead the Government.\nParagraph 3 (Guideline G - Alcohol Consumption). \n3.a. The Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for access to\npersonal sensitive information because she abuses alcohol to excess.\nApplicant's conduct which has been alleged in the SOR as 1.a., 1.b., 1.c., and 1.e.,\nrespectively, is included  in this paragraph under alcohol consumption. \nApplicant testified that at one point in her life she was consuming alcohol to the point of\nintoxication on four or more days out of every seven days week. She explained the primary reason\nfor her consuming such an excessive amount of alcohol was to help her cope with her boyfriend, who\nfrequently beat her. \nApplicant is no longer in a relationship, nor does she have any contact, with her previous\nboyfriend of five years. She stopped using alcohol completely for a period of five months, and she\nestimated that she now consumes alcohol one time a month, usually in her home and with her friends\nor roommates. Generally she consumes no more than four beers, although she has had six or seven\nbeers on occasion. She testified that she never drives a vehicle after she consumes alcohol, even one\nbeer. \nMitigation\nApplicant introduced two character letters, one from her direct supervisor, the second  from\nher landlord (Exhibit A). Her supervisor described Applicant in glowing terms as a model employee,\nwho is hard working, conscientious, and trustworthy. Her landlord spoke about Applicant as\nrespectful and very pleasant to be around.\nApplicant also submitted her current job performance evaluation (Exhibit B). While it\ndescribed Applicant as a new employee, it did identify her as someone who is eagerly striving to\nlearn all aspects of her job.\nFinally, Applicant submitted a \u201cCertificate of Excellence\u201d (Exhibit C) that she received in\nOctober 2007,  from her employer for being a \u201cTop Producer.\u201d\nPOLICIES\n\n5\nEnclosure 2 and Section E.2.2. of the 1992 Directive set forth both policy factors, and\nconditions that could raise or mitigate concerns.  Furthermore, as set forth in the Directive, each\ndecision must be a fair and impartial common sense determination based upon consideration of all\nthe relevant and material information and the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in enclosure\n2, including as appropriate:\na. Nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct, and surrounding\ncircumstances.\nb. Frequency and recency of the conduct.\n \nc. Age and maturity of the applicant.\nd. Motivation of the applicant, and the extent to which the conduct\nwas negligent, willful, voluntary, or undertaken with knowledge of\nthe consequence involved.\ne. Absence or presence of rehabilitation.\nf. Probability that circumstances or conduct will continue or recur in\nthe future.\u201d\nThe Administrative Judge, however, can only draw those inferences or conclusions that have\na reasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record.  The Judge cannot draw inferences or\nconclusions based on evidence that is speculative or conjectural in nature.\nThe Government must make out a case under Guidelines J, E, and G, which establishes doubt\nabout a person's judgment, reliability and trustworthiness.  While a rational connection, or nexus,\nmust be shown between an applicant's adverse conduct and her suitability for a sensitive Systems\nPosition, with respect to sufficiency of proof of a rational connection, objective or direct evidence\nis not required.\nThen, the Applicant must remove that doubt with substantial evidence in refutation,\nexplanation, mitigation or extenuation, which demonstrates that the past adverse conduct is unlikely\nto be repeated, and that the Applicant presently qualifies for a sensitive Systems Position.\nCONCLUSIONS\nHaving considered the evidence of record in light of the appropriate legal precepts and\nfactors, I conclude the following with respect to Guidelines J, E, and G: \n(Guideline J -Criminal Conduct) \n\n6\nThe Government has established by substantial evidence that Applicant engaged in criminal\nconduct, as she was cited or arrested for four alcohol related criminal offenses.\nIn reviewing the Disqualifying Conditions (DC) under Guideline J, DC 31. (a), a single\nserious crime or multiple lesser offenses, applies in this case. Under Mitigation conditions (MC), I\nfind that MC 32. (d) applies to this Applicant, as there is evidence of successful rehabilitation;\nincluding but not limited to the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, and sincere\nremorse.  Applicant\u2019s alcohol consumption which was clearly the cause of these criminal acts is now\nunder control and unlikely to lead her to criminal conduct in the future. Applicant has mitigated this\nallegation. Guideline J is found for Applicant. \n(Guideline E -Personal Conduct) \nWith respect to Guideline E, the evidence establishes that Applicant provided incorrect\nmaterial information to the Government in response to one question on the PTPA that she executed\non June 20, 2006. Applicant had received four citations and they should have been identified on the\nPTPA. As discussed above, I find that Applicant\u2019s explanation that she did not believe citations were\nto be included in her response to be credible and reasonable, and Applicant did not intend to mislead\nthe Government.\nIn reviewing the DCs under Guideline E,  I conclude that no DC applies against Applicant.\nI therefore, resolve Guideline E for Applicant.\n(Guideline G -Alcohol Consumption) \nAs discussed above, Applicant's alcohol consumption resulted in her being cited or arrested\nfor four alcohol related criminal offenses when she was consuming a tremendously excessive amount\nof alcohol.  As to the amount of alcohol she now consumes, as discussed above, Applicant continues\nto consume alcohol, but she consumes it far less frequently and in smaller amounts than previously.\nThe Government established, by substantial evidence, that Applicant was involved in\nalcohol-related incidents away from work, which is DC 22. (a), and DC (c ) that she engaged in\nhabitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired judgment. Applicant continues to\nconsume alcohol on a regular basis, but she has greatly reduced that consumption to once a month.\nI find that  MC 23. (a) applies as so much time as passed, and the behavior happened under\nunusual circumstances because of the abuse of her former boyfriend, that it is unlikely to recur and\ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability and trustworthiness.  Guideline G is found\nfor Applicant.\n        \nOn balance, it is concluded that the Applicant has overcome the Government's information\nopposing her request to hold a sensitive Systems Position . Accordingly, the evidence supports a\nfinding for Applicant as to the allegations expressed in Paragraphs 1, 2, and 3 of the Government's\nSOR. \nFORMAL FINDINGS\n\n7\nParagraph 1. Guideline J: FOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a.: For  Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b.: For Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.c.: For Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.d.: For  Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.e.: For  Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.f.: For  Applicant \nParagraph 2. Guideline E: FOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a.: For Applicant\nParagraph 3. Guideline G: FOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 3.a.: For  Applicant \nDECISION\nIn light of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly consistent with\nthe national interest to make or continue a determination of trustworthiness, suitability and eligibility\nfor the Applicant to hold a sensitive Systems Position (ADP-I/II/III).\nMartin H.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nElizabeth L. Newman, Esq.\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On September 24, 2007, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant\nof the basis for that decision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline C (Foreign Preference) and\nGuideline B (Foreign Influence) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as\namended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.  On March 24, 2008, after the hearing,\nAdministrative Judge Juan J. Rivera denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant\ntimely appealed pursuant to the Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal:  whether the Judge\u2019s findings are based on\nsubstantial evidence; whether the Judge\u2019s adverse security clearance decision under Guideline C is\narbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.\nThe Judge made the following relevant findings: Applicant is 40 years old.  She has worked\nfor the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) at the professional/managerial level since March\n2006.  She has had interim access to NATO classified information for approximately two years.\nThere is no evidence that Applicant has ever compromised classified information or that she has\nfailed to comply with rules and regulations concerning the protection of classified information. \nApplicant was born in the United States in 1968.  When she was eight years old, the whole\nfamily immigrated to Canada.  Applicant became a Canadian citizen, and attended high school and\nher first year of college in Canada.  Her parents are dual citizens of the United States and Canada and\ncurrently reside in Canada.\nIn 1987, Applicant married a Belgian citizen and moved to Belgium with her husband.  She\nautomatically acquired her Belgian citizenship as a result of her marriage. Except for a period of\naround seven months from 1999 to 2001, when Applicant was working for a U.S. company in the\nUnited States, Applicant has been a Belgium resident since 1987.  As a Belgium citizen, Applicant\nis required by law to vote in Belgian elections.  She has voted in five Belgian elections and intends\nto vote in Belgian elections in the future.  Applicant most recently voted in municipal elections in\nBelgium in October 2006. \nApplicant and her husband have five Belgian-born children.  Her four older children received\ntheir U.S. citizenship in July 2007.  Applicant was not able to transfer her U.S. citizenship to her\nchildren because she did not live in the United States for a period of two years after age 14.  Her\nchildren acquired their U.S. citizenship through their grandparents.  She is in the process of acquiring\nU.S. citizenship for her youngest child.\n \n\n3\nApplicant completed the last three years of her bachelor\u2019s degree in Belgium.  Additionally,\nshe received a master\u2019s in 1995, a doctorate (Ph.D.) in 2000, and another master\u2019s in 2006.\nApplicant attended Belgian universities as a Belgian national and received student grants.  As a\nBelgian citizen, she is entitled to and has received social welfare benefits such as healthcare,\nunemployment benefits, child allowances, and educational grants. She is also entitled to a small\ngovernment pension.  Applicant and her husband own no property either in the United States or\nBelgium.  She asserted they never intended to live permanently in Belgium and never purchased a\nhome.  In 1999, Applicant took a job in the United States with the idea of moving permanently to\nthe United States; however, her husband did not get a job, and they had to return to Belgium. The\nopportunity never presented itself again.  Applicant owns bank accounts both in Belgium and in the\nUnited States. She also voted in U.S. elections in 1996 and 2006, and is registered to vote in the\n2008 U.S. Presidential election.\nApplicant was interviewed in September 2006 by a government investigator.  The\ninvestigator noted in his summary of Applicant\u2019s interview that she was not ready to renounce her\nCanadian or Belgian citizenship.  At her hearing, Applicant expressed her willingness to renounce\nher Belgian citizenship, but presented no evidence of any efforts taken in that regard.  She also\nexpressed a preference for the United States.  Applicant held  Canadian and Belgian passports which\nshe surrendered in 2005.\n \nOn appeal, Applicant argues that the Judge\u2019s adverse clearance decision should be reversed\nbecause the Judge erred as to some of his findings.  She also argues that the Judge\u2019s adverse decision\nis arbitrary, capricious and contrary to law because the Judge failed to take into account significant\nrecord evidence, failed to articulate a satisfactory explanation for material conclusions, failed to\nconsider an important aspect of the case, and reached an overall decision that ran contrary to the\nrecord evidence.  The Board does not find Applicant\u2019s arguments persuasive.\nThe Board\u2019s review of a Judge\u2019s findings is limited to determining if they are supported by\nsubstantial evidence\u2014such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to\nsupport such a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the record.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1.\n\u201cThis is something less than the weight of the evidence, and the possibility of drawing two\ninconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent an administrative agency\u2019s finding from\nbeing supported by substantial evidence.\u201d Consolo v. Federal Maritime Comm\u2019n, 383 U.S. 607, 620,\n(1966).\nAfter reviewing the record, the Board concludes that the Judge\u2019s findings are based on\nsubstantial evidence, or constitute reasonable characterizations or inferences that could be drawn\nfrom the record.  Applicant has not identified any harmful error likely to change the outcome of the\ncase.  Considering the record evidence as a whole, the Judge\u2019s material findings of security concern\nare sustainable.\nOnce the government presents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the\napplicant to establish mitigation.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  The presence of some mitigating evidence\ndoes not alone compel the Judge to make a favorable clearance decision.  As the trier of fact, the\n\n4\nJudge has to weigh the evidence as a whole and decide whether the favorable evidence outweighs\nthe unfavorable evidence, or vice versa.  An applicant\u2019s disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of\nthe evidence, or an ability to argue for a different interpretation of the evidence, is not sufficient to\ndemonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence or reached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 07-05809 at 2 (App. Bd. May 27, 2008).\nThe Judge is presumed to have considered all the evidence in the record unless he specifically\nstates otherwise.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 04-08623 at 4 (App. Bd. Jul. 29, 2005).  He is not\nrequired to cite or discuss every piece of record evidence.  See, e.g, ISCR Case No. 04-01961 at 2\n(App. Bd. Jul. 12, 2007).  A review of the record indicates that the Judge weighed the mitigating\nevidence offered by Applicant against the length and seriousness of the disqualifying circumstances\nand considered the possible application of relevant conditions and factors.  He found in favor of\nApplicant under Guideline B.  However, he reasonably explained why the evidence which the\nApplicant had presented in mitigation was insufficient to overcome all the government\u2019s security\nconcerns under Guideline C.  The Board does not review a case de novo.  The favorable record\nevidence cited by Applicant is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge\u2019s decision is arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.  The Judge examined the relevant data and articulated a satisfactory\nexplanation for his decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the facts found and the choice\nmade.\u2019\u201d Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n of the United States v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S.\n29, 43 (1983) (quoting Burlington Truck Lines, Inc. v. United States, 371 U.S. 156, 168 (1962). \u201cThe\ngeneral standard is that a clearance may be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests\nof the national security.\u2019\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  Accordingly,\nthe Judge\u2019s adverse decision under Guideline C is sustainable.\nOrder\nThe decision of the Judge denying Applicant a security clearance is AFFIRMED.\nSigned: Michael D.

Newman, Esquire \n \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nRIVERA, Juan J., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant failed to mitigate the foreign preference security concerns arising from \nher exercise of dual citizenship with Belgium. Eligibility for access to classified \ninformation is denied.  \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted her Security Clearance Application (SF 86) on May 4, 2005. \nOn September 24, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the Government\u2019s security concerns under \nGuideline C (Foreign Preference) and B (Foreign Influence).1  \n  \n \n1  The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the \nrevised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective \nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nMarch 24, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on October 12, 2007, and requested a hearing \nbefore an Administrative Judge. The case was assigned to me on December 6, 2007. \nDepartment Counsel contacted Applicant in Belgium to propose hearing dates. \nApplicant requested her hearing be conducted via video teleconference (VTC), and a \nhearing date of February 11, 2008 (Tr. 9-10). DOHA issued a notice of hearing on \nJanuary 16, 2008.  \n \nThe hearing was convened as scheduled on February 11, 2008. Applicant and \nher witness appeared through VTC from a facility in Brussels, Belgium. Department \nCounsel, Applicant\u2019s counsel, and I were located in Arlington, Virginia. The government \noffered exhibits (GE) 1 through 6, which were admitted without objection, except for the \nthird page of GE 6, which was not admitted (Tr. 14). Applicant testified on her own \nbehalf, and presented the testimony of one witness and one exhibit, marked AE 1, \nwhich was received without objection. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) \non February 20, 2008.  \n \nProcedural Ruling \n \n \nBy motion dated November 28, 2007, the Government indicated it would not \npursue the Guideline B concerns alleged in the SOR, and that it would not oppose \nfindings for the Applicant. Based on the motion, Applicant mitigated the Guideline B \nconcerns with her answers to the SOR and other information provided. My decision will \naddress only the Guideline C concerns. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nIn her Answers to the SOR, Applicant admitted SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.c with \nexplanations. Her admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a \nthorough review of all evidence of record, I make the following additional findings of fact.  \n \nApplicant is 40 years old. She has worked for the North Atlantic Treaty \nOrganization (NATO) at the professional/managerial level since March 2006 (GE 3, Tr. \n37). She has had interim access to NATO classified information for approximately two \nyears (Tr. 28-29, 55). There is no evidence that Applicant has ever compromised \nclassified information or that she has failed to comply with rules and regulations \nconcerning the protection of classified information. \n \nApplicant\u2019s parents are Jewish holocaust survivors (GE 3). After World War II, \nher father was sent from Germany to England where he grew up. He came to the United \nStates in 1953 to attend college, and became a U.S. naturalized citizen in 1975. Her \nmother immigrated from Lithuania to Canada where she grew up and became a \nCanadian citizen. She moved to the United States in 1959, and became a U.S. \nnaturalized citizen in 1975. Her parents married that same year. Applicant was born in \nthe United States in 1968. In 1986, when Applicant was eight years old, her father took \na job in Canada, and the whole family immigrated to Canada. Applicant became a \nCanadian citizen, and attended high school and her first year of college in Canada (Tr. \n\n \n3 \n \n \n23). Her parents are dual citizens of the United States and Canada and currently reside \nin Canada. \n \nIn 1987, Applicant married a Belgian citizen and moved to Belgium with her \nhusband. She automatically acquired her Belgian citizenship as a result of her marriage. \nExcept for a period of around seven months from 1999 to 2001, when Applicant was \nworking for a U.S. company in the United States, Applicant has been a Belgium resident \nsince 1987 (Tr. 23-24). As a Belgium citizen, Applicant is required by law to vote in \nBelgian elections. She has voted in five Belgian elections (GE 2). She felt compelled to \nvote in light of Belgian law which makes voting mandatory.  \n \nApplicant and her husband have five Belgian born children; ages 17, 14, 10, 5, \nand a three-month-old baby (Tr. 25). Her four older children received their U.S. \ncitizenship in July 2007 (Tr. 42-46). Applicant was not able to transfer her U.S. \ncitizenship to her children because she did not live in the United States for a period of \ntwo years after age 14. Her children acquired their U.S. citizenship through their \ngrandparents. She is in the process of acquiring U.S. citizenship for her new baby. \n \nApplicant completed the last three years of her bachelor\u2019s degree in mathematics \nin Belgium (Tr. 27-28). Additionally, she received a master\u2019s degree in computer \nscience in 1995, a doctorate degree (Ph.D.) in mathematics and theoretical computer \nscience in 2000, and a master\u2019s in business administration in 2006. Applicant attended \nBelgian universities as a Belgian national and received student grants (Tr. 48-51).  \n \nSince 1987, Applicant has worked sporadically for private companies, a foreign \ncompany, and as a university research assistant (GE 1). As a Belgian citizen, she is \nentitled to and has received social welfare benefits such as healthcare, unemployment \nbenefits, child allowances, and educational grants. She is also entitled to a small \ngovernment pension (Tr. 48). Applicant and her husband own no property either in the \nUnited States or Belgium (Tr. 47). She claimed they never intended to live permanently \nin Belgium and never purchased a home (Tr. 57). In 1999, Applicant took a job in the \nUnited States with the idea of moving permanently to the United States, however, her \nhusband did not get a job and they had to return to Belgium. Thereafter, the opportunity \nnever presented itself again (Tr. 58-59). Applicant owns bank accounts both in Belgium \nand in the United States. She also voted in U.S. elections in 1996 and 2006, and is \nregistered to vote in the 2008 U.S. Presidential election. \n \nIn 2005, when Applicant applied for her NATO job, she was informed about the \nsecurity clearance concerns raised by having Canadian and Belgium passports and was \nasked to surrender them. She surrendered both passports in November 2005 (GEs 5, \n6). Applicant claimed she was not informed that her dual citizenship, voting in Belgium, \nor otherwise receiving social welfare benefits from Belgium (exercising her dual \ncitizenship) could raise security concerns. Applicant became aware of these security \nconcerns for the first time when she received the pending SOR in September 2007 (Tr. \n35-36, 40). Notwithstanding, Applicant was interviewed in September 2006 by a \ngovernment investigator concerning possible foreign preference and foreign influence \n\n \n4 \n \n \n                                                          \nsecurity concerns. The investigator noted in his summary of Applicant\u2019s interview that \n\u201cshe [was] not ready to renounce her Canadian or Belgian citizenship[s]\u201d (GE 3). \n \nAt her hearing, Applicant expressed several times her willingness to renounce \nher Belgian citizenship to eliminate security concerns raised by her dual citizenship (Tr. \n41). She presented no evidence of efforts taken to renounce her Belgian citizenship.  \n \nApplicant considers herself a loyal American. She stated: \u201cMy loyalty to the \nUnited States is undivided. My family relationships in the United States are deep and \nlongstanding. There is no conflict of interest. If ever a conflict of interest appears I will, \nwithout hesitation, resolve the conflict in favor of the United States interest\u201d (GE 2). As \nevidence of her ties to the United States she noted that her children are U.S. citizens, \nshe assures their connection to the United States by sending them to the United States \nfor summer camps and to visit their friends and relatives living in the United States. \nApplicant and her spouse speak English at home, and their children are fluent in English \n(Tr. 26). \n \nApplicant has four siblings. Her 29-year-old brother was born in Canada. He is a \ncitizen and resident of Canada. Her 26-year-old sister was born in Canada. She married \na U.S. citizen, became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 2000, and resides in the United \nStates. Both her half-brother and half-sister were born in the United States and are \nresidents of the United States.  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nThe purpose of a security clearance decision is to resolve whether it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s eligibility for \naccess to classified information.2 \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s controlling \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \n \n2  See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988). \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \n                                                          \nThe protection of national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d3 In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline C, Foreign Preference \n \nUnder Guideline C the government\u2019s concern is that \u201c[w]hen an individual acts in \nsuch a way as to indicate a preference for a foreign country over the United States, then \nhe or she may be prone to provide information or make decisions that are harmful to the \ninterests of the United States.\u201d AG \u00b6 9. \n \nApplicant was born and lived in the United States for the first eight years of her \nlife. At age eight, she moved to Canada with her parents, and became a Canadian \ncitizen. She attended Canadian schools and enjoyed the privileges of her Canadian \ncitizenship, including a Canadian passport. In 1987, at age 19, she married a Belgian \nnational and automatically acquired her Belgian citizenship. She moved to Belgium in \n1987, and she has lived in Belgium ever since.  \n \n3  Egan, supra, at 528, 531. \n\n \n6 \n \n \n                                                          \n \nApplicant considers herself a tri-citizen of the United States, Canada, and \nBelgium. Her home is in Belgium where she has lived with her Belgian husband since \nage 19. She completed college, and two higher education degrees with the assistance \nof Belgium educational grants. Except for a bank account in the United States, all of \nApplicant\u2019s and her spouse\u2019s financial/economic interests are in Belgium. Applicant\u2019s \nchildren were born and educated in Belgium. Applicant has received or is entitled to -- \non her own right or through her spouse\u2019s or children\u2019s citizenship, -- privileges and \nbenefits reserved for Belgian citizens such as a Belgian identification card, a Belgian \npassport, educational grants, unemployment and healthcare benefits, child allowances, \nand a pension. She also voted in five Belgian elections. \n \nHer actions constitute an exercise of dual citizenship and raises security \nconcerns under Guideline C. Foreign preference disqualifying condition AG 10(a), \n\u201cexercise of any right, privilege or obligation of foreign citizenship after becoming a U.S. \ncitizen or through the foreign citizenship of a family member. This includes . . . (3): \naccepting educational, medical, retirement, social welfare, or other such benefits from a \nforeign country, and (7) voting in a foreign election,\u201d apply. \n \n \nThe Government produced substantial evidence of the disqualification condition \nin AG \u00b6 10(a)(3) and (7), and the burden shifted to Applicant to produce evidence and \nprove a mitigating condition. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts \nto the Government.4 \n \n  \nAG \u00b6 11 provides for six foreign influence mitigating conditions that are \npotentially applicable: \n \n(a) dual citizenship is based solely on parents\u2019 citizenship or birth in a \nforeign country; \n \n(b) the individual has expressed a willingness to renounce dual \ncitizenship; \n \n(c) exercise of the rights, privileges, or obligations of foreign citizenship \noccurred before the individual became a U.S. citizen or when the \nindividual was a minor; \n \n(d) use of a foreign passport is approved by the cognizant security \nauthority. \n \n(e) the passport has been destroyed, surrendered to the cognizant \nsecurity authority, or otherwise invalidated; \n \n \n4See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \n(f) the vote in a foreign election was encouraged by the United States \nGovernment. \n \nApplicant surrendered her Belgian passport in 2005. At her hearing she \nexpressed her willingness to renounce dual citizenship. Mitigating conditions AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n11(b) and (e) apply. The remainder of AG \u00b6 11 mitigating conditions are either not \napplicable or were not fairly raised by the evidence of record. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n\u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d Under AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant strongly averred her \nloyalty to the United States, that she feels like an American, her desire to raise her \nchildren as Americans, and to live in the United States. Applicant has had access to \ninterim NATO classified information for the last two years and there is no evidence that \nhe she failed to comply with rules and regulations concerning the protection of classified \ninformation. \n \nAlthough Applicant surrendered her passport and expressed willingness to \nrenounce her dual citizenship, considering the record evidence as a whole, her \nfavorable evidence is not sufficient to mitigate the foreign preference security concerns. \nApplicant has stronger ties and connection with Belgium than with the United States. \nShe was born in the United States, but only lived the first eight years of her life in the \nUnited States. Except for a period of less than one year around 1999-2001, during \nwhich she worked and resided in the United States, she has lived 31 years of her life in \nforeign countries. She has lived in Belgium as a Belgian citizen for the last 21 years of \nher life enjoying all the privileges and benefits reserved for Belgian citizens. \n \n\n \n8 \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s social, emotional, and financial ties are connected to her husband, \nand their children all of whom are Belgian citizens. This is partially confirmed by her \n2006 statement to a government investigator to the effect that she was not ready to \nsurrender her dual citizenship. On balance, I am not convinced that Applicant\u2019s \nfavorable evidence is sufficient to outweigh the potential conflicting loyalties for Belgium \nand the United States. \n \n\u201cBecause of the extreme sensitivity of security matters, there is a strong \npresumption against granting a security clearance. Whenever any doubt is raised . . .  it \nis deemed best to err on the side of the government\u2019s compelling interest in security by \ndenying or revoking [a] clearance.\u201d Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F.2d 1399, 1401 (9th Cir. \n1990).  After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, all the facts and \ncircumstances, in the context of the whole person, I conclude she has not mitigated the \nsecurity concerns pertaining to foreign preference. The evidence leaves me with doubts \nas to Applicant\u2019s security eligibility and suitability.  \n \nFor all these reasons, I conclude Applicant has failed to mitigate the concerns \narising from her foreign preference security concerns.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline C:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.c: \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline B:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.e: \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s security clearance. \nEligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n_________________ \nJUAN J.

Acting under the relevant Executive Order \nand DoD Directive,1 the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued to \n \n \n \n1\n                                                          \n1 Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, \n1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative \nSeptember 26, 2008\n\n \n \n \n2\n                                                                                                                                                                                          \nApplicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) on April 4, 2008, detailing security concerns \nunder Foreign Preference and Foreign Influence. \n \n \nOn May 2, 2008, Applicant answered the SOR, and requested a hearing. On \nJune 10, 2008, I was assigned the case. On July 28, 2008, DOHA issued a notice of \nhearing scheduling the hearing held on August 27, 2008. The government offered \nExhibits (Ex.) 1 and 2, which were admitted into evidence. Applicant testified on his own \nbehalf and submitted Exhibits A through T, which were admitted into evidence. Four \nadditional witnesses testified on his behalf. On September 8, 2008, the transcript (Tr.) \nwas received.  \n \nProcedural and Evidentiary Rulings \n \nRequest for Administrative Notice \n \nDepartment Counsel submitted a formal request that administrative notice be \ntaken of certain facts relating to Iran. The request and the attached documents were not \nadmitted into evidence but were included in the record as Hearing Exhibits (HEx) I\u2500XII. \nThe facts administratively noticed are set out in the Findings of Fact, below.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant denied the factual allegations in \u00b6 1.g and \u00b6 \n2.a of the SOR and admitted the remaining factual allegations. \n \n \nApplicant is a 42-year-old electrical engineer who has worked for a defense \ncontractor since September 2005, has a secret clearance, and is seeking to obtain a top \nsecret security clearance. (Tr. 202) In October 2002, he received a letter of appreciation \nfor his professionalism, skills, and dedication to quality work. (Tab M) In January 2007, \nApplicant received a certificate of appreciation (Tab N) for his \u201ctremendous efforts\u201d in \nmanaging and coordinating the building of a laboratory and electronics fabrication \nfacility. In February 2008, his work earned him a $4,500 bonus for outstanding \naccomplishments and contributions to the company. (Tr. 135, Tab L) His duty \nperformance with this current employer have been outstanding and/or consistently been \nabove acceptable levels. (Tabs G, H, I, J, K, and Q) \n \n \nApplicant, his parents, and sister lived in Southern Iran. His father was an \nelectrical engineer and his mother a house wife. Applicant was attending international \nschool studying his courses in English and Persian. (Tr. 114, Gov Ex 2, p. 48) In 1979, \nthe Islamic Revolution in Iran closed most international schools. Applicant \u2013 then age 12 \n\u2013 went to Tehran to live with his grandparents and to continue attending an international \nschool. Before the revolutionary government closed the school he was attending in \nTehran, all the library books were piled up and burned, which Applicant found shocking. \n(Tr. 118, Gov Ex 2, p. 48) \n \nguidelines (AG) approved by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of \nDefense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n\n \n \n \n3\n \nIn September 1980, Iraq invaded Iran following a long history of boarder \ndisputes. At the start of the Iran-Iraq war, Applicant was attending school in Tehran and \nhis family was in Tehran seeking medical treatment for Applicant\u2019s father. His father was \ngoing blind, suffering from macular degeneration. His family had anticipated being in \nTehran for two weeks before returning home, but the war prevented them from returning \nhome. Applicant\u2019s home town lay between the front lines of the two battling armies. It \nwas heavily bombed during the war. Applicant learned his home had been looted, \nbombed, burned, and then bulldozed to the ground. (Tr. 123) All personal belongings \nwere lost. (Gov Ex 2, p. 45) \n \nTreatment for his father\u2019s eye sight problem was not available in Iran. His father \nasked to leave the country for treatment. He Iranian government showed no sympathy \nand was unwilling to grant him an exit visa. (Tr. 116, 202) When a visa was finally \ngranted, Applicant \u2013 then age 14 \u2013 was allowed to accompany his father due to his \nfather\u2019s inability to care for himself because of his blindness. Applicant\u2019s mother and \nsister were not allowed to accompany them and could not leave Iran for another year. \n(Tr. 113) The insensitive, brutal Iranian government made it very difficult for them to \nleave, following insults and a great deal of abuse, they were finally allowed to leave. (Tr. \n121-122, 177) Two of Applicant\u2019s aunts remained in Iran. \n \nApplicant and his father spent a month in England obtaining a visa to the U.S.. \n(Tr. 119) Applicant and his father went to England because Applicant\u2019s father had \nstudied for seven years in England. They came to the U.S. because his mother\u2019s three \nbrothers and his father\u2019s sister were living in the U.S.  \n \n \nApplicant stayed with his uncle and his father went to live with his sister in Texas. \nWhen allowed to leave, his mother and sister joined his father and they now live \ntogether in California. (Tr. 120, 124, 202) Applicant worked as a busboy at this uncle\u2019s \nrestaurant for two or three years. His pay as a bus boy paid for his college. He had no \nscholarships or financial aid because of his foreign status. (Tr. 127) In school, he \nbecame a teacher\u2019s assistant. At age 16 he had become independent and moved in \nwith two roommates for a year or two.  \n \nIn the fall of 1983, he started attending university. (Tr. 125) In December 1987 \nand May 1988, he obtained three bachelor\u2019s degrees in physics, mathematics, and \nelectrical engineering. (Tab A, D, E) In May 1992, he obtained a master\u2019s degree in \nelectrical engineering. (Tab A, Tab F) Applicant\u2019s uncle died of a heart attack at the age \nof 38. While Applicant was working on his PhD, Applicant\u2019s grandfather died of a heart \nattack. Soon after his grandfather\u2019s death, Applicant learned he was suffering from \nretinal detachment in both eyes and without treatment would go blind. (Tr. 128, Gov Ex \n2, p. 49) Applicant\u2019s surgery and recovery interrupted his further PhD studies.  \n \n \nIn October 1995, Applicant became a U.S. citizen. In December 2000, his sister \nbecame a naturalized U.S. citizen; in July 2001, his father; and in November 2001, his \nmother became a naturalized U.S. citizen.  \n\n \n \n \n4\n \n \nDuring December 1997 and January 1998, Applicant returned to Iran for the first \ntime since leaving in 1981. He wanted to visit his home for the purpose of closure. (Tr. \n140) Applicant left his home in Iran abruptly taking no pictures or other material. When \nApplicant and his family left Iran all they could take was one suitcase each. On his visit, \nApplicant visited his neighborhood that was now an open field with all houses having \nbeen reduced to rubble. Streets were yet discernable. He was able to locate the cleared \nfoundations of his family home by identifying some fragments of his mother\u2019s broken \nchina on the ground in the open field. From the location of his former home, only flat \nland without structures existed for miles around. (Gov. Ex. 2, p. 45)  \n \n \nApplicant waited until he was a U.S. citizen before returning to Iran. He was \napprehensive about the trip. He had said he would never return to Iran. On the trip he \ncould not relate to anybody in Iran, the culture, or even the surroundings. (Gov Ex. 2, p. \n45)  \n \nApplicant\u2019s two aunts remained in Iran. His first real conversation with his aunts \ncame when he was age 31. (Tr. 179) He has no bonds of affection for them. Both are \nretired accountants. One is married to a retired doctor the other to a retired \naccountant.(Gov Ex 2, p. 23, Tab B) He talks to one aunt once a year and has not \ntalked with his other aunt for \u201cquite some time.\u201d (Gov Ex 2, p. 29) During the 1997 trip, \nApplicant stayed with an aunt who was interested in getting him married. (Gov Ex. 2, p. \n10) Prior to his trip, he had no contact was his relatives in Iran. (Tr. 143) His \ngrandmother living in the U.S. did have contact. On this trip by mere chance he visited \nhis future father-in-law, who was a friend of Applicant\u2019s grandfather. (Tr. 143) Applicant \nwas invited to dinner at his future in-laws home, but does not remember seeing his \nfuture wife. He was 31 years old and his future wife was 14 or 15. (Tr. 145)  \n \nIn 2000, Applicant visited Iran for 12 days. He was seeking a wife and his aunt \nknew a young woman who was a doctor who might have been a suitable bride. They \nmet, but nothing came of the meeting. (Tr. 147) Following this trip, Applicant never \nagain visited Iran. \n \nOn his two trips to Iran, Applicant carried both his U.S. (Gov Ex 2, p. 53-92) and \nIranian (Gov Ex 2, p. 93 -114) passports. He entered Iran as a U.S. citizen. Having been \nborn in Iran, his Iranian passport was required for his entry into the country. (Tr. 147) In \n2007, Applicant gave his Iranian passport to his company\u2019s security officer to be \ndestroyed. (Tr. 152, Gov Ex 2, p. 13, 14) The passport expired on April 11, 2007. (Gov \nEx 2, p. 39) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s grandmother informed Applicant about his future wife. (Tr. 155) His \nfuture wife was then 22 years old. At his grandmother\u2019s insistence, Applicant called his \nfuture wife. For six months, Applicant and his future wife talked on the telephone for \nmany hours. (Tr. 159) They corresponded for close to a year. (Tr. 16) In April 2004, they \nagreed to meet in Turkey. While there, he proposed and she accepted. (Tr. 161) She \nreturned to Iran and he to the U.S. In October 2004, Applicant traveled to Turkey for five \n\n \n \n \n5\ndays for the wedding. (Tr. 163) On both trips, Applicant\u2019s wife was accompanied by her \nbrother, who Applicant met each time. None of her other relatives were able to attend \nthe wedding. Applicant had asked his company\u2019s security officer if he could go to Iran \nfor the wedding. He was told it was not a good idea to do so. (Tr. 164) His wife wanted a \nwedding in Iran, but Applicant told her this was something he could not grant her. \n \nApplicant\u2019s father-in-law is retired from a furniture factory and his mother-in-law is \na house wife. (Tr. 169) One of his wife\u2019s sisters is an accountant and the other a \nuniversity student studying accounting. (Tr. 169, Gov Ex 2, p. 19, 29) One of his \nbrothers-in-law worked as a salesman in a furniture store and the other sells food \nproducts. (Tr. 170, 198) Gov Ex 2, p. 19) Applicant met the one brother-in-law when he \naccompanied his sister to Turkey to meet Applicant. Applicant has never met his other \nbrother-in-law. (Tr. 168)  \n \nApplicant refused to jeopardize his security clearance by traveling to Iran to meet \nwith her parents before asking her to marry him or for the wedding. In 2004, Applicant \nand his wife married the day after he arrived in Turkey. (Tr. 112) He returned to the U.S. \nand applied for a visa for his wife. (Tr. 16) She returned to Iran. In 2005, Applicant\u2019s wife \nobtained her \u201cgreen card,\u201d permanent resident alien card. (Tab R, Gov Ex 2, p. 18) \nWhen the visa was granted, Applicant returned to Turkey, met his wife and met her \nbrother, and returned to the U.S. with his wife. In August 2008, his wife applied for U.S. \ncitizenship, which was her first opportunity to do so. (Tr. 171, Tab S) His wife is \ncurrently a student. (Tr. 208) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s wife talked with her family weekly. Applicant refuses to talk with them \nfor fear of jeopardizing his clearance. He has talked with one brother-in-law, and has not \ntalked with his other brother-in-law or sisters-in-law. (Gov Ex 2, p. 29) Because of his \nclearance, Applicant has purposely not had a relationship with his wife\u2019s family. (Tr. \n166) Once a year, he will talk with his parents-in-laws for 30 seconds to a minute, \nwishing them a Happy New Year and asking how they are. (Tr. 167, 199) It is tradition \nto call relatives on New Year\u2019s Day. (Tr. 208) He also talked briefly with them in 2007 \nwhen they congratulated him on the birth of his daughter. (Tr. 194) Currently, he has no \ncommunication with his sisters-in-law or brothers-in-law. (Tr. 167) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s landlord first met Applicant when Applicant was 22 years old and a \nstudent and has maintained close contact with him since that time. Applicant lived in his \nlandlord\u2019s home for five years. (Tr. 28) She states Applicant is serious, by the book \nindividual who always strives to achieve the highest level. Applicant is very honest, \nhardworking, diligent, and patriotic. (Tr. 33, 34) Applicant feels deeply and is very \npassionate in his beliefs. His former land lady refers to Applicant\u2019s daughter as \u201cher\u201d \ngranddaughter.  \n \nA co-worker describes Applicant\u2019s technical and professional performance as \nexceptional. (Tab T) Applicant is honest, trustworthy, a person of high integrity, who is \ndevoted to his job and the people for whom he works. Applicant is passionate about \nbeing an American and being able to serve his country. (Tab T) \n\n \n \n \n6\n \n \nApplicant\u2019s division manager at work, and one time Applicant\u2019s direct supervisor, \nstates Applicant is very conscientious, honest to a fault, passionate, trustworthy, a hard \nworker, and so reliable Applicant was entrusted with building a new laboratory. (Tr. 50 \u2013 \n61) Applicant has strong feelings against the government of Iran. A co-worker who first \nmet Applicant in college in 1985 and has known him since 1992, states Applicant is \nbright, hard working, and maintains the highest integrity. He recognizes that Applicant \nappreciates the opportunities he has received in the U.S. (Tr. 77) \n \nAnother co-worker Applicant met in 1983 and started working with Applicant in \n1992, states Applicant is highly principled to the point he referred to Applicant as \n\u201cnoble.\u201d (Tr. 97) Applicant is productive, rational, and possessing a very disciplined \nmind. (Tr. 99) Applicant has expressed to him Applicant\u2019s strong negative feelings about \nthe Iranian government. This co-worker has such trust in Applicant that he would entrust \nhis children to Applicant\u2019s care. (Tr. 101) \n \n \nApplicant has no love for the government of Iran who he refers to as \u201cbrutal, \nanimalistic, scum of the earth,\u201d and an infection on this planet, and if not contained or \neliminated will more cause problems. (Tr. 176) He sees the Islamic revolution in Iran as \nravaging the country, causing chaos, anarchy, fundamentalist extremism, and \ncharacterized it as being surrounded by a plague of infectious disease. (Gov Ex 2, p. 4) \nApplicant described the government of Iran as a \u201cpyramid scheme of evil. \u201c (Tr. 201) He \nbelieves the Iranian government should be wiped out. Applicant describes the Iranian \ngovernment as terrorists and explains one can not trust, deal with, or appease terrorists. \n(Tr. 182) There is nothing one can do except seek help from the authorities. (Tr. 181) \nApplicant believes nothing said by the Iranian government is worthy of belief. (Gov Ex 2, \np. 47)  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s attitude toward the Iranian government is summed up as follows: \n \nIt\u2019s because before I die, I want to know that there\u2019s a sense of justice in \nthis world, that scum like this that come to the earth and put so much \nhorror on to so many people\u2019s lives will some day get what\u2019s coming to \nthem and if I can be a part of this, I\u2019ll be very proud and it means a lot to \nme to be part of that. . . it would make me very happy to wipe out this \ngovernment in any way possible and I hope I can help in any way I can.  \n \nIt\u2019s not that I just dislike them. I highly encourage whatever needs to be \ndone to eliminate this government. It\u2019s not a government. It\u2019s an occupying \ninfection that everybody is suffering. (Tr. 178 -179) \n \nIf the Iranian government pressured his relatives in Iran, Applicant knows there is \nnothing he can do because you can not negotiate with a terrorist. He would never \ncooperate with evil in any attempt to ensure his relatives safety or release should they \nbe detained. (Gov Ex 2, p. 46) Applicant twice attempted to join the U.S. military but \n\n \n \n \n7\n                                                          \nwas told by the recruiter he could not join because he only had a \u201cgreen card.2\u201d (Tr. \n185) Since becoming a citizen, he is too old to join the U.S. military. He would take no \naction endangering his family in the U.S. or endangering America. (Gov. Ex 2, p. 46)  \n \nApplicant sums up his attitude toward security of classified information as follows: \n \nClassified information, giving up classified information is worse than being \na serial murderer or being a rapist of children because in a sense you\u2019re \ngiving out the security of the whole nation, of all the children, of all the \nwoman, of all the men.  \n \nSo this question is like are you willing to do the highest crime of the land, \nhighest crime, you know, that would, you know, tarnish my name, my \nfamily name, my children in the future, not to mention wipe out everything I \never worked for in my life. (Tr. 180 -181) \n \n \nApplicant no longer takes simple things such as \u201cseeing\u201d for granted. He realizes \nbecoming a U.S. citizen was a gift and blessing. (Tr. 212) He believes in the principles \nof the U.S. (Gov Ex 2, p. 3) He is proud to be a U.S. citizen and is proud of what the \nU.S. represents. He sees his current job as a way contributing to the U.S. and \nprotecting U.S. military members and the country. The U.S. is the only country for which \nhe is willing to die. Applicant states his \u201cAmerican citizenship is the most valuable \npossession that I have in my life.\u201d (Tr. 211)  \n \n \nApplicant has spent the last 27 years living in the U.S. In 2007, Applicant\u2019s \ndaughter was born in the U.S. (Tr. 112) He has 76 relatives living in the U.S. including \nhis parents, sister, grandmother, four uncles, aunts, and numerous cousins. (Tab B) His \nuncles and aunts began immigrating to the U.S. in the 1960\u2019s. (Tr. 205) His \ngrandmother, two uncles, and aunts all live in Applicant\u2019s geographical vicinity and he \nsees them often. (Tr. 210) \n \nIran \n \n \nIran is a constitutional Islamic republic with a theocratic system of government in \nwhich Shi\u2019a Muslim clergy dominate the key power structures, and ultimate political \nauthority is vested in a learned religious scholar. The U.S. has not had diplomatic \nrelations with Iran since 1980. The President\u2019s National Security Strategy has stated \nthat the United States \u201cmay face no greater challenge from a single country than from \nIran.\u201d  \n \nThe U.S. Government has defined the areas of objectionable Iranian behavior as: \n \n$ \nIran=s efforts to acquire nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass \ndestruction; \n \n2 This restriction against joining the military as a resident alien was later changed.  \n\n \n \n \n8\n                                                          \n$ \nIts support for and involvement in international terrorism; \n$ \nIts support for violent opposition to the Middle East peace process;  \n$ \nIts dismal human rights record; and \n$ \nIran=s intervention in the internal affairs of Iraq.3 \n \n \nThe U.S. has designated and characterized Iran as the most active state sponsor \nof terrorism. Iran provides critical support to non-state terrorist groups. The government \nof Iran has committed numerous, serious human rights abuses against the Iranian \npeople. Abuses include political killings and incarceration; summary executions, \nincluding of minors; disappearances; religious persecution; torture; arbitrary arrest and \ndetention, including prolonged solitary confinement; denial of due process; severe \nrestrictions on civil liberties - speech, press, assembly, association, movement and \nprivacy; severe restrictions on freedom of religion; official corruption; violence and legal \nand societal discrimination against women, ethnic and religious minorities, and \nhomosexuals; trafficking in persons; and child labor.  \n \n \nThe State Department continues to warn U.S. citizens to consider carefully the \nrisks of travel to Iran. U.S. citizens who were born in Iran and the children of Iranian \ncitizens\u2014even those without Iranian passports who do not consider themselves Iranian- \nare considered Iranian citizens by Iranian authorities, since Iran does not recognize dual \ncitizenship. Therefore, despite the fact that these individuals hold U.S. citizenship, under \nIranian law, they must enter and exit Iran on an Iranian passport, unless the Iranian \ngovernment has recognized a formal renunciation or loss of Iranian citizenship. U.S.-\nIranian dual nationals have been denied permission to enter/depart Iran using their U.S. \npassport; they even had their U.S. passports confiscated upon arrival or departure. \nU.S.-Iranian dual citizens have been detained and harassed by the Iranian government. \nIranian security personnel may place foreign visitors under surveillance. Hotel rooms, \ntelephones and fax machines may be monitored, and personnel possessions in hotel \nrooms may be searched. \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n \n3Country Reports on Terrorism 2007, Chapter 3 \u2013 State Sponsors of Terrorism Overview, U.S. \nDepartment of State, Office of the Coordinator for Counterterrorism, dated April 30, 2008 (country Report \non Terrorism). \n\n \n \n \n9\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nForeign Influence \n \n  \nAG \u00b6 6 explains the security concern about \u201cforeign contacts and interests\u201d \nstating: \n \nif the individual has divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, [he or \nshe] may be manipulated or induced to help a foreign person, group, \norganization, or government in a way that is not in U.S. interests, or is \nvulnerable to pressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Adjudication \nunder this Guideline can and should consider the identity of the foreign \ncountry in which the foreign contact or financial interest is located, \n\n \n \n \n10\nincluding, but not limited to, such considerations as whether the foreign \ncountry is known to target United States citizens to obtain protected \ninformation and/or is associated with a risk of terrorism. \n \nAG \u00b6 7 indicates three conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n \n(a) contact with a foreign family member, business or professional \nassociate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a \nforeign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign \nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion;  \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual=s obligation to \nprotect sensitive information or technology and the individual=s desire to \nhelp a foreign person, group, or country by providing that information; \n(d) sharing living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of their \ncitizenship status, if the potential for adverse foreign influence or duress \nexists; \nApplicant traveled to Iran in 1997 and 2000. These are the only two trips to Iran \nhe has taken to Iran in the last 27 years since leaving Iran at age 14. He has two aunts \nwho are residents and citizens of Iran, with which he has minimal contact. Applicant\u2019s \nwife is an Iranian citizen living in the U.S. with a permanent resident alien card. Her \nparents, two brothers, and two sisters are citizens and residents of Iran. Applicant \nrefuses to talk with his in-laws when they call for fear of jeopardizing his clearance. He \nhas purposely not had a relationship with his wife\u2019s family. \n \nThe mere possession of family and in-laws in a foreign country is not, as a matter \nof law, disqualifying under Guideline B. However, if only one relative lives in a foreign \ncountry, and an Applicant has frequent, non-casual contacts with that relative, this factor \nalone is sufficient to create the potential for foreign influence and could potentially result \nin the compromise of classified information. See ISCR Case No. 03-02382 at 5 (App. \nBd. Feb. 15, 2006); ISCR Case No. 99-0424 (App. Bd. Feb. 8, 2001). However, \nApplicant\u2019s direct contact with his relatives living in Iran is somewhat infrequent and \ncasual.  \n \nThe nature of a nation\u2019s government, its relationship with the United States, and \nits human rights record are relevant in assessing the likelihood that an Applicant\u2019s family \nmembers are vulnerable to government coercion. The risk of coercion, persuasion, or \nduress is significantly greater if the foreign country has an authoritarian government, a \nfamily member is associated with or dependent upon the government, or the country is \nknown to conduct intelligence operations against the United States. The country of Iran \nplaces a heavy, but not insurmountable burden of persuasion on Applicant to \ndemonstrate that his relationship with his aunts and in-laws in Iran does not pose a \n\n \n \n \n11\n                                                          \nsecurity risk and he is not in a position to be forced to choose between loyalty to the \nUnited States and his family members.4 With its mixed human rights record, and other \npolitical, economic and military rivalry with the United States, it is conceivable that Iran \nwould target any citizen in an attempt to gather valuable information from the United \nStates. \n \nBecause of all of these factors,. AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(b) and 7 (d) apply.  \n \nAG \u00b6 8 lists six conditions that could mitigate foreign influence security concerns \nincluding: \n \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nU.S.; \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country \nis so minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding \nrelationships and loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected \nto resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest;  \n \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation; \n \n(d) the foreign contacts and activities are on U.S. Government business or \nare approved by the cognizant security authority; \n \n(e) the individual has promptly complied with existing agency \nrequirements regarding the reporting of contacts, requests, or threats from \npersons, groups, or organizations from a foreign country; [and] \n \n \n4 An applicant with relatives in Iran, for example, has a heavier burden to overcome than an \napplicant with relatives living in Russia. See ISCR Case No. 02-13595 at 3 (App. Bd. May 10, 2005) \n(stating an applicant has \u201ca very heavy burden of persuasion to overcome the security concerns\u201d when \nparents and siblings live in Iran). See also ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 4 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) \n(articulating \u201cvery heavy burden\u201d standard when an applicant has family members living in Iran); ISCR \nCase No. 07-12471 at 9 (A.J. May 30, 2008) (stating \u201cBetween January 9, 2007 and January 18, 2008, \nthe Appeal Board decided 36 appeals involving Iran under the old guidelines, and it reversed 20 decisions \ngranting clearances and affirmed 15 decisions denying clearances.\u201d And listing at 9 n.1 the pertinent \ncases).   \n \n\n \n \n \n12\n                                                          \n(f) the value or routine nature of the foreign business, financial, or property \ninterests is such that they are unlikely to result in a conflict and could not \nbe used effectively to influence, manipulate, or pressure the individual. \n  \n \n \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 8(a), 8(c) and 8(f) partially apply and 8(b) fully applies with to Applicant\u2019s \naunts and in-laws because of his limited contacts with them. Both aunts are retired \naccountants. One is married to a retired doctor the other to a retired accountant \nApplicant did not know his aunts growing up. He has no bonds of affection for them. His \nfirst real conversation with them occurred at age 31. Before he went to Iran in 1997, he \nhad no contact with any of his relatives living there. He talks to one aunt once a year \nand has not talked with his other aunt for \u201cquite some time.\u201d  \n \nHis parent-in-law, brothers-in-law, and his sisters-in-law, who are residents and \ncitizens of Iran are not security concerns. He has talked to one brother-in-law when that \nbrother accompanied Applicant wife to Turkey before they were married and has not \ntalked to his sisters-in-law or other brother-in-law. Because of concern over his \nclearance, Applicant\u2019s telephone contact is limited to short New Year\u2019s Day greetings. \u201cIt \nis unlikely [he] will be placed in a position of having to choose between the interests of \n[these relatives] and the interests of the U.S.\u201d See AG \u00b6 8(a). His infrequent contacts \nand not particularly close relationship with these in-laws have a low potential of forcing \nhim to choose between the United States and the Iran. He met his burden of showing \nthere is \u201clittle likelihood that [his relationships with these relatives] could create a risk for \nforeign influence or exploitation.\u201d See AG \u00b6 8(c). His contacts and communications with \nthese relatives are so casual and infrequent as to result in a very low risk of foreign \ninfluence or exploitation.  \n \nThere is no evidence that these relatives have been political activists, challenging \nthe policies of the Iranian Government. There is no evidence these relatives currently \nwork for or have ever worked for the Iranian Government or military or any news media, \nother than mandatory, conscripted military service required of all men in Iran, which \napplied to his brother-in-law. There is no evidence that terrorists or the Iranian \nGovernment have approached or threatened Applicant or these relatives for any reason. \nThere is no evidence that these family members living in Iran currently engage in \nactivities which would bring attention to them or that they or other Iranian elements are \neven aware of Applicant\u2019s work. As such, there is a reduced possibility that these \nrelatives would be targets for coercion or exploitation.5  \n \n5 In ISCR Case No. 06-17838 at 4 (App. Bd. Jan. 28, 2008), the Appeal Board discussed the \nprecedential value of the decisions predating the revision of the Adjudicative Guidelines indicated in n. 3, \nsupra, and determined where the language of the Directive is unchanged or not substantively altered, the \nprecedent remains valid. AG \u00b6 8(c) apparently adopted the Appeal Board\u2019s interpretation of Foreign \nInfluence Mitigating Condition 1 (FIMC 1) under the previous guidelines. The Appeal Board had \ndetermined that contacts with relatives living in a foreign country must be both casual and infrequent to \napply FIMC 1. See ISCR Case No. 04-12500 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006). Moreover, contacts with such \nfamily members are presumed to be \u201cnot casual.\u201d Id. In the analysis of countervailing evidence, it is legal \nerror to give significant weight to any of the following facts or factors: applicant\u2019s ties to the United States \n(ISCR Case No. 02-13595 at 5 (App. Bd. May 10, 2005)); lack of prominence of relatives living in a \nforeign country (Id.); \u201cfamily members\u2019 low-key and noncontroversial lifestyle, and the fact that the Iranian \n\n \n \n \n13\n                                                                                                                                                                                          \nApplicant clearly stated his strong, negative beliefs about the Iranian \ngovernment, which he refers to as \u201cbrutal, animalistic, scum of the earth,\u201d an infection \non this planet, and if not contained or eliminated will more cause problems. He believes \nthe Islamic revolution has brought evil to Iran. He believes it is ravaging the country, \ncausing chaos, anarchy, fundamentalist extremism, and is like being surrounded by a \nplague of infectious disease. He believes the Iranian government should be wiped out. \nApplicant sees the Iranian government as terrorists and one can not trust, deal with, or \nappease terrorists. Should the Iranian government bring pressure to bear on this aunts \nor in-laws there is nothing he could do except seek help from the authorities for anything \nsaid by the Iranian government is not worthy of belief.  \n \nApplicant has lived the last 27 of his 42 year life in the U.S. He has been a citizen \nsince 1995. His daughter was born in the U.S. Applicant has 76 relatives living in the \nU.S. including his wife, daughter, parents, sister, grandmother, uncles, aunts, and \ncousins. He realizes becoming a U.S. citizen was a gift and blessing. He believes in the \nprinciples of the U.S., is proud to be a U.S. citizen, and is proud of what the U.S. \nrepresents. He sees his current job as a way contributing to the U.S. and protecting \nU.S. military members and the country. He describes his American citizenship as the \nmost valuable possession that he has.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s deep relationship with the United States weighs against a security \nconcern for the relationships with his aunts and in-laws. Applicant has \u201csuch deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the U.S., [he] can be expected to resolve any \nconflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest.\u201d His spouse and daughter reside in the \nUnited States. His wife lived in the United States since 2005 and is fully inculcated with \nU.S. values. He attended U.S. schools, obtaining three bachelor\u2019s degrees and a \nmaster\u2019s degree. He has worked for his current government contractor with great \ndistinction. AG \u00b6 8(b) fully applies to mitigate security concerns. \n \nAG \u00b6 8(f) partially applies for he has no financial interest or property outside the \nU.S. AG \u00b6\u00b6 8(a) and 8(b) partially apply and 8(c) fully applies because Applicant\u2019s does \nnot have a close relationship with his aunts and intentionally maintains a distant \n \ngovernment has not contacted them about Applicant\u201d (ISCR Case No. 04-12500 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, \n2006); one relative living in a foreign country may be sufficient to negate FIMC 1 (ISCR Case No. 03-\n02382 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 15, 2006)); a foreign relative\u2019s fragile health (ISCR Case No. 02-29403 at 4 \n(App. Bd. Dec. 14, 2004)), advanced age (ISCR Case No. 02-00305 at 7 (App. Bd. Feb. 12, 2003), \nfinancial independence (ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 6 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005), or lack of financial \ndependency upon applicant (ISCR Case No. 03-15205 at 4 (App. Bd. Jan 21, 2005)); foreign relatives  \nspend part of each year in the U.S. (ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 6 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005)); the lack of \nany connection between the foreign relative and the foreign government in question (ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 6 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005)); the absence of any attempt at exploitation in the past (ISCR Case \nNo. 03-15205 at 4 (App. Bd. Jan. 21, 2005)); a foreign country\u2019s friendly relationship with the U.S., its \nstable, democratic government, or its extensive foreign military agreements with the United States (ISCR \nCase No. 02-22461 at 5-6 (App. Bd. Oct. 27, 2005)) and an applicant\u2019s \u201crefusal to travel to Iran\u201d and \n\u201cmeticulous work habits and practice of strictly following the rules relating to his work\u201d (ISCR Case No. 03-\n15205 at 3 (App. Bd. Jan. 21, 2005)). Notwithstanding the Appeal Board\u2019s position, I conclude that many \nof these attributes are pertinent to the analysis in this case under the whole person concept.   \n \n\n \n \n \n14\nrelationship from his in-laws. The security concerns as to his aunts and in-laws are \nmitigated.  \n \nGuideline CBForeign Preference \nUnder AG \u00b6 9, foreign preference is a security concern when an individual acts in \nsuch a way as to indicate a preference for a foreign country over the United States, then \nhe or she may be prone to provide information or make decisions that are harmful to the \ninterests of the United States. Additionally, the possession or use of a foreign passport \nis a condition that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying.  \n \nOn his two trips to Iran in 1997 and 2000, Applicant carried both his U.S. and \nIranian passports. Applicant chose not to return to Iran until he was a U.S. citizen and \nthen entered Iran as a U.S. citizen. Having been born in Iran, he was required to show \nhis Iranian passport for his entry into the country. The passport expired on April 11, \n2007. In 2007, Applicant gave his Iranian passport to his company\u2019s security officer who \ndestroyed it.  \n \nAG & 10(a) (1) states a security concern could be raised by \u201cexercise of any \nright, privilege or obligation of foreign citizenship after becoming a U.S. citizen or \nthrough the foreign citizenship of a family member. This includes but is not limited to: (1) \npossession and/or use of a foreign passport.\u201d Applicant showed his Iranian passport as \nrequired as identification when entering Iran. I find AG 10(a) applies.  \n \nAG & 11 lists conditions that could mitigate security concerns. AG & 11(b) states \nthe \u201cindividual has expressed a willingness to renounce dual citizenship,\u201d and AG & \n11(e), which states \u201cthe passport has been destroyed, surrendered to the cognizant \nsecurity authority, or otherwise invalidated,\u201d apply. \n \nIt is hard to imagine how Applicant\u2019s dislike for the Iranian government could be \nstronger. Become a U.S. citizen is his most prized possession. He is not an Iranian \ncitizen. He has willingly renounced his Iranian citizenship. The Iranian passport is no \nlonger a \u201cvalid\u201d passport for it expired in April 2007. Additionally, the passport was \nsurrendered to the company\u2019s security officer and destroyed. Applicant has \ndemonstrated that he no longer holds a foreign passport and that he has renounced his \nIranian citizenship. He has mitigated foreign preference in this case. The finding must \nbe for Applicant.  \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \nProtection of our national security is of paramount concern. Applicant \nunderstands this and stated to give up classified information would be the highest crime \nof the land for it surrenders the security of the nation.  \n \n\n \n \n \n15\nSecurity clearance decisions are not intended to assign guilt or to impose further \npunishment for past transgressions. Rather, the objective of the adjudicative process is \nthe fair-minded, commonsense assessment of a person=s trustworthiness and fitness for \naccess to classified information. In reaching this decision, I have considered the whole \nperson concept in evaluating Applicant=s risk and vulnerability in protecting our national \ninterests. I considered the totality of Applicant\u2019s family ties to Iran and the heavy burden \nan Applicant carries when he has family members in a foreign country.  \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. \n \nIn the more than 27 years since he left Iran, Applicant returned twice. Applicant \nreceived his three bachelor\u2019s degrees and his master\u2019s degree in the U.S. Applicant has \nno love for the Iranian government, understands the seriousness of being granted \naccess to classified information, and is thankful to be a U.S. citizen. He intentionally \nlimits his contact with his in-law. His concern for his clearance was such that he was \nunable to grant his wife\u2019s wish to be married in Iran and they married in Turkey.  \n \nApplicant has two aunts and in-laws in Iran, but has 76 relatives living in the U.S. \nincluding his wife, daughter, parents, sister, grandmother, uncles, aunts, and cousins. I \nhave carefully weighed the evidence in favor of Applicant against the government=s \nconcerns about Applicant=s ability to protect classified information. I adopt my analysis \nunder Guideline B and C for the whole person concept. I find that there is little potential \nfor Applicant to be pressured, coerced, or exploited because his aunts or in-laws live in \nIran. Overall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant mitigated the foreign influence and foreign preference security \nconcerns. \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n16\nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Foreign Influence:  \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a \u2013 1.f: \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Foreign Preference:  \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n \n_________________ \nCLAUDE R. HEINY II \nAdministrative Judge \n \n \n",

On February 28, 2008, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant\nof the basis for that decision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline E (Personal Conduct) and\nGuideline J (Criminal Conduct) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as\namended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.  On October 22, 2008, after the hearing,\nAdministrative Judge Roger C. Wesley denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.\nApplicant timely appealed pursuant to the Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s adverse clearance\ndecision is arbitrary, capricious or contrary to law.\nApplicant contends that the Judge\u2019s adverse decision should be reversed because the Judge\ndid not give sufficient weight to Applicant\u2019s mitigating evidence.  Specially, he argues that, although\nhe falsified material facts in two interviews with a government investigator and in a signed sworn\nstatement, \u201c[b]y the completion of the investigating process, [he] had made a good-faith effort to\ncorrect earlier omissions.\u201d   He also argues that the disqualifying conduct is not likely to recur in the\n1\nfuture, and that \u201c . . . the threat of exploitation, manipulation, or duress ha[s] been greatly reduced.\u201d2\nApplicant has not demonstrated that the Judge decision is arbitrary, capricious or contrary to law.\nThe presence of some mitigating evidence does not alone compel the Judge to make a\nfavorable security clearance decision.  As the trier of fact, the Judge has to weigh the evidence as a\nwhole and decide whether the favorable evidence outweighs the unfavorable evidence, or vice versa.\nSee, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-10320 at 2 (App. Bd. Nov. 7, 2007).  An applicant\u2019s disagreement with\nthe Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, or an ability to argue for a different interpretation of the\nevidence, is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence or reached conclusions in\na manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-17409 at 3\n(App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2007).\nIn this case, the Judge weighed the mitigating evidence offered by Applicant against the\nseriousness of the disqualifying conduct and considered the possible application of relevant\nconditions and factors.  He found in favor of Applicant with respect to several of the SOR factual\nallegations.   However, the Judge reasonably explained why the mitigating evidence was insufficient\n3\nto overcome the government\u2019s security concerns.  The Board does not review a case de novo.  The\nfavorable evidence cited by Applicant is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge\u2019s decision is\narbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-11172 at 3 (App. Bd. Sep. 4,\n2007).

A hearing was convened on July 29, 2008, for the purpose of considering\nwhether it would be clearly consistent with the national interest to grant, continue, or\ndeny, Applicant\u2019s application for a security clearance.  At Applicant\u2019s request, the\nhearing was continued, and rescheduled for September 17, 2008. At hearing, the\nGovernment's case consisted of four exhibits; Applicant relied on two witnesses\nOctober 22, 2008\n\n2\n(including himself) and seven exhibits.  The transcript (R.T.) was received on August 7,\n2008.  Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony,\neligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nProcedural Rulings and Evidentiary Issues\nBefore the close of the hearing, Applicant requested the record be kept open to\npermit him the opportunity to supplement the record with endorsements.  For good\ncause shown, Applicant was afforded 14 days to supplement the record.  He did not file\nany supplemental materials. \n   \nSummary of Pleadings\nUnder Guideline E, Applicant is alleged to have (a) made false statements in a\nDoD interview in June 2006 about his never abusing his spouse, (b) made false\nstatements to an authorized investigator in a signed, sworn statement of September\n2007 concerning his choking of his spouse, using a knife on his spouse, and threatening\nto kill her, and \u00a9) made false statements to an authorized DoD investigator in an initial\nOctober 2007 interview concerning his choking of his spouse, his threatening her with a\nknife, and his telling her he was going to killer her, (d) been restrained from making\ncontact with his spouse by a protection order filed in January 2007, which was\nsubsequently extended a year under March 1999 modification order, and (e) been\nissued a temporary order for protection against domestic violence in July 2000, which\nwas extended to one year.  Under Guideline J, Applicant\u2019s alleged misstatements\ncovered by Guideline E are incorporated by reference.\n For his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the substantive acts covered by\nGuidelines E and J, but denied any intention to provide false information in any of his\ncovered DoD interviews in 2006 and 2007.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 52-year-old-employee of a defense contractor who seeks a security\nclearance.  The allegations covered in the SOR and admitted to by Applicant are\nincorporated herein and adopted as relevant and material findings.  Additional findings\nfollow.\nApplicant was born and raised in India to parents of Indian descent (see ex. 1;\nR.T., at 59).  He married W (also of Indian descent) in December 1982 and has four\nchildren from this marriage (see exs. 1, 2 and 5; R.T., at 44).  He immigrated to the U.S.\nin 1988 at the age of 35 (R.T., at 60).  W joined him in 1990 (ex. 3).  Applicant and W\nboth became naturalized U.S. citizens in January 1995 (see exs. 1 and 2). They\nseparated in March 1999, but are still married.\nApplicant and W argued frequently during their marriage.  Most of their\narguments involved disputes over W\u2019s spending in consumer stores and outlets that W\n\n1\n         At hearing, Applicant trimmed his earlier acknowledgments, claiming his hand accidentally slipped on\nto W \u2019s mouth, and he did not mean to threaten W  with a knife (R.T., at 55-56, 72-75).  If true, this changes the\nwhole tenor of Applicant\u2019s physical exchanges from physical assaults and threats to inadvertent actions and\ndisplays on his part.  For the first time, he claimed confusion when asked about his post-polygraph\nadmissions.  He  provided no plausible explanation, though, for why he did raise confusion when questioned\nabout his earlier denials in his post-polygraph interview.  Considering his earlier failure to admit any of the\ndetails of his physical encounters with his wife until he was confronted in a post-polygraph interview, his\nhearing claims cannot be accepted as credible corrections of his earlier accounts.   \n3\nenjoyed frequenting.  Their arguments often turned physical .  Between 1982 and 1988\n(when they resided in India), Applicant sometimes slapped W in the face with his open\nhand (see ex. 3).  When first questioned by an investigator from the Defense\nInvestigative Service (DSS) in September 2003, he estimated he slapped her on four to\nfive occasions during this period, but never physically assaulted her in any way (see ex.\n3; R.T., at 69). \nAfter W joined applicant in the U.S. in 1990, they continued to argue over more\nissues related to W\u2019s shopping habits.  On several occasions (at least four to five),\nApplicant physically assaulted W (mostly by slapping her with an open hand).  \nSometime in September 1998, Applicant and W had a particularly heated\nexchange in which W cursed him in her native Urdu language.  W\u2019s strong words were\nuttered in the presence of Applicant\u2019s children, causing him considerable insult and\nembarrassment.  Applicant responded by physically grabbing W by the throat and briefly\nchoking her while placing his other hand over her mouth (see ex. 4).   Applicant\u2019s\n1\nactions caused W\u2019s nose to bleed.   \nOn another occasion (in January 1999), Applicant told W that he was going to kill\nher (see ex. 4).  In still another cited argument, Applicant brandished a knife in front of\nW and threatened to kill her (see ex. 4).  Applicant was in the kitchen at the time of this\nincident and held up the knife in a threatening gesture.  As a result of these physical\nthreats from Applicant, W sought and obtained an order for protection in January 1999\n(see ex. 5; R.T., at 57-58).  In March 1999, she obtained a modification of the protective\norder that covered reimbursement for medical expenses associated with her injuries\nsustained in her 1998 assault (see ex. 5).  \nApplicant\u2019s physical exchanges with W caused considerable strains in their\nmarriage.  They tried marriage counseling for awhile, but without any manifest success\n(R.T., at 50).  Unable to repair the growing rifts in their marriage, they separated in\nMarch 1999.  Applicant and W remain separated, while still married.\nApplicant has expressed remorse for his actions and has been forgiven (see ex.\nA).   W (in retrospect) acknowledges some responsibility over the handling of her\ndisputes with Applicant and credits Applicant with \u201ca lot of good things,\u201d high moral\nstandards, and no intention, in hindsight, of trying to kill her (see ex. A).  During her\n\n4\nvisits from Applicant and their daughters, W and Applicant \u201cdon\u2019t fight much,\u201d and\ngenerally get along (ex. A).\nWhen first interviewed by an DSS agent in December 2006, Applicant was asked\na number of questions about W\u2019s abuse allegations.  In this initial interview, Applicant\ndenied any physical abuse of W.  When the DSS agent expressly informed him of D1's\nallegations of his physical attempts to kill W and his brandishing of knives, Applicant\nroundly rejected the allegations (see ex. 4).  The same DSS agent interviewed Applicant\na second time - this one in September 1977 (see exs. 3 and 4).  In this interview,\nApplicant admitted to slapping W on numerous occasions between 1982 and 1998, and\nplacing his hand over her mouth on one occasion (in 1998), which caused her nose to\nbleed.  But he denied ever trying to choke W, or threatening to kill her with a knife in the\npresence of her children (see ex. 4).\nApplicant\u2019s denials of any physical exchanges and threats prompted the DSS\nagent to schedule a polygraph with Applicant in October 2007.  During the pre-\npolygraph phase of the DSS polygrapher\u2019s exchange with Applicant, Applicant repeated\nhis denials of his ever choking W in an argument, or ever threatening her with a knife\nduring any of their arguments (ex. 4).\nFollowing his opening interview with the DSS agent, the agent polygraphed\nApplicant.  After this testing phase, the agent conducted a post-polygraph interview.  In\nthis interview, Applicant for the first time admitted to (a) putting his hand over W\u2019s throat\nin 1998 and briefly choking her and (b) placing his hand over her mouth, which caused\nher nose to bleed (ex. 4).  Applicant admitted, too, to threatening to kill W in a heated\nargument, and brandishing a knife in a threatening manner in W\u2019s presence (ex. 4).  At\nhearing, though, Applicant trimmed his earlier admissions.  \nApplicant attributes his denials of his physical assaults of W to embarrassment.\nHis omissions and misstatements were clearly made, though, in a knowing and wilful\nmanner and were corrected only after a series of confrontations from the interviewing\nagent.\nApplicant and W continue to see each other periodically, even though they\nremain separated (R.T., at 63).  Neither spouse has filed for divorce, and Applicant\nremains interested in reconciling with W (see ex. A; R.T., at 63).  He is characterized by\nhis daughters as a good, supportive and reliable father (see exs. C and D).  His landlord\ndescribes Applicant as patient, dependable, and ready to carry out his obligations (see\nex. B). \nPolicies\nThe revised Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to\nClassified Information (effective September 2006) list Guidelines to be considered by\njudges in the decision making process covering DOHA cases.  These Guidelines require\nthe judge to consider all of the \"Conditions that could raise a security concern and may\n\n5\nbe disqualifying\u201d (Disqualifying Conditions), if any, and all of the \"Mitigating Conditions,\"\nif any, before deciding whether or not a security clearance should be granted, continued\nor denied.  The Guidelines do not require the judge to assess these factors exclusively\nin arriving at a decision.  In addition to the relevant Adjudicative Guidelines, judges must\ntake into account the pertinent considerations for assessing extenuation and mitigation\nset forth in E.2.2 of the Adjudicative Process of Enclosure 2 of the Directive, which are\nintended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and impartial common sense decision.\nViewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following adjudication\npolicy factors are pertinent herein:\nPersonal Conduct\nThe \nConcern: \nConduct \ninvolving \nquestionable \njudgment,\nuntrustworthiness, \nunreliability, \nlack \nof \ncandor, \ndishonesty, \nor\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information.  Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful\nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other\nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.  AG \u00b6 18.\nCriminal Conduct\nThe Concern: Criminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s\njudgment, reliability, and trustworthiness.  By its very nature, it calls into\nquestion a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules and\nregulations.  Adjudication Guidelines (AG) \u00b6 18\nBurden of Proof\nBy virtue of the precepts framed by the revised Adjudicative Guidelines, a\ndecision to grant or continue an applicant's security clearance may be made only upon\na threshold finding that to do so is clearly consistent with the national interest.  Because\nthe Directive requires Administrative Judges to make a common sense appraisal of the\nevidence accumulated in the record, the ultimate determination of an applicant's\neligibility for a security clearance depends, in large part, on the relevance and\nmateriality of that evidence.  As with all adversary proceedings, the Judge may draw\nonly those inferences which have a reasonable and logical basis from the evidence of\nrecord.  Conversely, the Judge cannot draw factual inferences that are grounded on\nspeculation or conjecture.\nThe Government's initial burden is twofold: (1) It must prove any controverted\nfact[s] alleged in the Statement of Reasons and (2) it must demonstrate that the facts\nproven have a material bearing  to the applicant's eligibility to obtain or maintain a\nsecurity clearance.  The required showing of material bearing, however, does not\nrequire the Government to affirmatively demonstrate that the applicant has actually\n\n6\nmishandled or abused classified information before it can deny or revoke a security\nclearance. Rather, consideration must take account of cognizable risks that an applicant\nmay deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information.\nOnce the Government meets its initial burden of proof of establishing admitted or\ncontroverted facts, the burden of persuasion shifts to the applicant for the purpose of\nestablishing his or her security worthiness through evidence of refutation, extenuation or\nmitigation of the Government's case.\nAnalysis  \nApplicant physically assaulted his wife on a number of occasions over the course\nof their long marriage and on two occasions threatened to kill her and/or cause her\nserious bodily harm.  When asked about his actions in DSS interviews he minimized\nand denied his actions.  Not until confronted by a DSS investigator in a post-polygraph\ninterview did he admit the extent of his physical actions and his underlying intent.\nSecurity concerns are raised over Applicant\u2019s physical exchanges with his wife and his\nensuing omissions before submitting to a post-polygraph interview in 2003.\nPotentially serious and difficult to reconcile with the trust and reliability\nrequirements for holding a security clearance are the timing and circumstances of\nApplicant\u2019s multiple omissions and misstatements over his physical assaults and threats\non his wife, and in his withholding of abusive actions  until he was confronted by a DSS\npolyghrapher in a post-polygraph interview in October 2007.  So much trust is imposed\non persons cleared to see classified information that deviation tolerances for candor\nlapses are gauged very narrowly. \nMitigation of Applicant\u2019s omissions and misstatements are difficult to credit\nApplicant with,  since he failed to promptly correct his omissions and misstatements\nuntil he was confronted in a post-polygraph interview.   In the past, the Appeal Board\nhas denied applicants availability of the predecessor mitigating condition of MC \u00b6 27(a)\n(the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, concealment, or\nfalsification before being confronted with the facts) where the applicant has waited many\nmonths to timely correct a known omission. Compare ISCR Case No. 97-0289 (Appeal\nBd. January 1998) with DISCR Case No. 93-1390 (Appeal Bd. January 1995).  \nBy contrast, the protection orders that W sought and obtained against Applicant,\nwhile necessary and appropriate at the time they were issued in 1999 and 2000, have\nnot been renewed.  Applicant and W have made concerted efforts to reconcile and\nmaintain peace and harmony with their daughters, and have demonstrated considerable\nprogress over the past eight years.  MC \u00b6 27\u00a9)), \u201cthe offense is so minor, or so much\ntime has passed, or the behavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such unique\ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s\nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment,\u201d is applicable to these facts.  Applicant\nand W convince that they have made significant strides in repairing the damage to their\nmarriage and family unit.  Applicant, for his part, has inspired trust and confidence from\n\n7\nboth his wife and daughters and exhibits no likelihood of any recurrent familial breaches\nthat prompted W to seek public intervention from the courts. \nBy willfully and knowingly failing to disclose his multiple acts of physical assaults\nand threats on his wife until confronted, Applicant concealed materially important\nbackground information needed for the government to properly process and evaluate\nhis security clearance application.  His probative reasons for his omitting his actions\narrest/charges (embarrassment) are not sustainable grounds for averting inferences of\nfalsification.  Weighing all of the circumstances surrounding his multiple assault/threat\nomissions and misstatements, and lack of any prompt, good faith corrections,\nApplicant\u2019s claims lack the necessary probative showing to avert drawn conclusions that\nhe knowingly and deliberately withheld material background information about his prior\nphysical assaults and threats. \nKnowing and wilful falsification is also covered by the criminal conduct guidelines.\nMitigation of the criminal features of his omissions falls along a little bit different fault line\nthan is the case with personal conduct considerations. To be sure, an applicant\u2019s\npositive work record and demonstrated family and community commitments can play a\nmajor role in mitigating criminal conduct coverage of his omissions.  MC \u00b6 32(d), \u201cthere\nis evidence of successful rehabilitation, including but not limited to the passage of time\nwithout recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or restitution, job training or higher\neducation, good employment record, or constructive community involvement,\u201d has\npotential application to Applicant\u2019s situation.  Employment of this guideline and the use\nof separate whole-person weighing of Applicant\u2019s actions and personal assessments of\nhis family and landlord contributions weigh in his favor, but are not to mitigate the\nrepeated nature of his omissions and misstatements to the DSS agent who interviewed\nhim and eventually confronted him. \nConsidering all of the evidence produced in this record and the available\nguidelines in the Directive (inclusive of the E2.2 factors), unfavorable conclusions\nwarrant with respect to subparagraphs 1.a through 1.g of Guideline E and subparagraph\n2.a of Guideline 2.a. Favorable conclusions warrant, however, with respect to\nsubparagraphs 1.h through 1.j of Guideline E.\nIn reaching my decision, I have considered the evidence as a whole, including\neach of the E2 2.2 factors enumerated in the Adjudicative Guidelines of the Directive.\nFormal Findings\nIn reviewing the allegations of the SOR and ensuing conclusions reached in the\ncontext of the findings of fact, conclusions, conditions, and the factors listed above, I\nmake the following formal findings:\nGUIDELINE E: (PERSONAL CONDUCT):                   AGAINST APPLICANT\nSub-para. 1.a:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\n\n8\nSub-para. 1.b:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSub-para. 1.c:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSub-para. 1.d:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSub-para. 1.e:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSub-para. 1.f::\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSub-para. 1.g:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSub-para. 1.h:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSub-para. 1.I:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSub-para. 1.j:\nFOR APPLICANT\nGUIDELINE J: (CRIMINAL CONDUCT):\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSub-para. 1.a:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nConclusions\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s security\nclearance.

He is a 46-year-old copper technician employed by a defense contractor since January 2005. He appears to have been investigated for a clearance while in the military in 1992. In January 1994, Applicant was honorably discharged from the U.S. military for a pattern of misconduct. Between June 1992 and October 1993, Applicant was cited for misconduct eight separate times by six different military supervisors. The most serious of the incidents\u2014and the direct precipitant of the administrative separation\u2014were domestic assaults against his spouse in March 1993 and October 1993. However, the other incidents also provide insight into the issues highlighted in the SOR (G.E. 7). In June 1992, he was cited for failure to follow instructions. In August 1992, he was late to work. March 1993 was the first domestic violence incident, in which Applicant and his wife got involved in an altercation over their 10-week-old baby.

Applicant answered the SOR 28 April 2008, and requested a hearing. DOHA\n1\nassigned the case to me 2 October 2008, and I convened a hearing 30 October 2008.\nDOHA received the transcript (Tr.) 6 November 2008. \nJanuary 30, 2009\n\n2\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant admitted the SOR allegations of 1.c., 1.d., 1.e., and 1.f. He denied the\nremaining allegations. He is a 46-year-old copper technician employed by a defense\ncontractor since January 2005.  He appears to have been investigated for a clearance\nwhile in the military in 1992.\nIn January 1994, Applicant was honorably discharged from the U.S. military for a\npattern of misconduct. Between June 1992 and October 1993, Applicant was cited for\nmisconduct eight separate times by six different military supervisors. The most serious\nof the incidents\u2014and the direct precipitant of the administrative separation\u2014were\ndomestic assaults against his spouse in March 1993 and October 1993. However, the\nother incidents also provide insight into the issues highlighted in the SOR (G.E. 7). In\nJune 1992, he was cited for failure to follow instructions. In August 1992, he was late to\nwork. March 1993 was the first domestic violence incident, in which Applicant and his\nwife got involved in an altercation over their 10-week-old baby. Later in March 1993, he\nwas cited for misusing a government vehicle. In April 1993, he received performance\ncounseling that noted his \u201cargumentative . . . me attitude.\u201d May 1993 performance\ncounseling noted that his \u201cpersonal feelings surface in an unprofessional manner.\u201d\nAugust 1993 performance counseling reported that he \u201c[had] a habit of doing things that\nare for you and not anyone else\u201d and demonstrating an \u201call me attitude.\u201d In each\ninstance, he was not recommended for promotion to paygrade E-5.\nAppellant\u2019s conduct while in the military established the pattern he later exhibited\nin his private-sector employment from 1994 to 2004. In October 1996, he quit his job\nwith a defense contractor following allegations of time card fraud. In October 1998, he\nwas fired from his job as a consulting engineer for the defense in a lawsuit when he\nbegan dating one of the plaintiffs while the case was still pending. He later married her.\nIn January 2002, he quit his job following allegations of aggressive behavior against a\nco-worker. In April 2003, he was fired from his job with a defense contractor for\nmisusing government computers, specifically accessing pornographic websites. Finally,\nin June 2004, he was fired from his job for making unacceptable comments to female\nstaffers of the company\u2019s client, and for ignoring client requests about working on the\nclient\u2019s equipment.\nApplicant attributes these incidents to his zeal for accomplishing his employer\u2019s\ngoals and the resistance he perceived from co-workers or supervisors that were not as\ncompetent or dedicated as himself. In no instance does he consider any portion of his\nbehavior or conduct to have contributed to the incidents recorded against him.\nApplicant is alleged to have falsified his December 2004 clearance application by\nfailing to disclose his June 2004 firing. He is also alleged to have falsely stated the\nreason he quit his job in October 1996 to an investigator during a subject interview in\nAugust 2007.\n\n3\nRegarding his clearance application, Applicant disclosed his April 2003 firing and\nhis October 1998 firing. The government\u2019s evidence concerning his June 2004 firing\n(G.E. 14) suggests that Applicant was dismissed by the company in part for the\nmisconduct reported by a company client in June 2004. However, that evidence does\nnot state that Applicant was informed of those reasons at the time of his dismissal.\nApplicant\u2019s August 2007 sworn statement (G.E. 8) that he was told that his services\nwere no longer needed and given no specific reason for his termination is not rebutted\nelsewhere in the record. His sworn statement that he later had a telephone conversation\nwith the company that revealed the alleged misconduct to him does not establish that\nhe had that conversation with the company before he completed his clearance\napplication in December 2004.\nRegarding the allegation that he misstated the reason he left his job in October\n1996 in his August 2007 sworn statement, the fact that he did not characterize his\ndeparture with the language preferred by the government does not, of itself, establish a\nfalsification. He stated in part, \u201cI was recorded piggybacking into the facility behind\nanother employee. I did not use my own badge on that occasion . . . \u201c That statement\nreasonably infers time card fraud. Further, Applicant was interviewed under oath in\nAugust 2006 (G.E. 10), during which he provided a more detailed description of\n\u201cpiggybacking\u201d and disclosed that he had been questioned about his hours worked\nduring a meeting with his supervisor that precipitated his decision to leave his job. He\nprovided essentially the same information in an unsworn declaration made in\nSeptember 2002 (G.E. 11). The government investigator recorded Applicant revealing\nallegations of falsifying his time card. The undisputed facts are that Applicant left this job\nin October 1996 and that even if I concluded that his departure was under adverse\ncircumstances he was not required to disclose this on his clearance application, as it\nwas more than seven years before he completed his application in December 2004.\nGiven his substantial disclosure of the circumstances of his departure in September\n2002 and August 2006, and his description of \u201cpiggybacking\u201d in August 2007, the\ngovernment could not have been mislead and any allegation to the contrary is based on\na quibble over word choice.\nApplicant\u2019s current employer considers him an excellent employee, and believes\nhe can be trusted with classified information. His life-long friends also consider him\nreliable and trustworthy. Applicant claims to be more settled now and correctly notes\nthat he has had no further incidents since he was fired in June 2004.\nPolicies\nThe Revised Adjudicative Guidelines (RAG) list factors to be considered in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for access to classified information. Administrative\nJudges must assess both disqualifying and mitigating conditions under each issue fairly\nraised by the facts and circumstances presented. Each decision must also reflect a fair\nand impartial common sense consideration of the factors listed in RAG \u00b6 2(a). The\npresence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not determinative for or\nagainst Applicant. However, specific adjudicative guidelines should be followed where a\n\nSee, Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988).\n2\n\u00b6 16.(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is not sufficient for an adverse\n3\ndetermination under any other single guideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-\nperson assessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness\nto comply with rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the person may not properly\n4\ncase can be measured against them, as they represent policy guidance governing the\ngrant or denial of access to classified information. Considering the SOR allegations and\nthe evidence as a whole, the relevant, applicable, adjudicative guideline is Guideline E\n(Personal Conduct).\nSecurity clearance decisions resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant or continue an Applicant\u2019s security clearance. The government\nmust prove, by something less than a preponderance of the evidence, controverted\nfacts alleged in the SOR. If it does so, it establishes a prima facie case against granting\naccess to classified information. Applicant must then refute, extenuate, or mitigate the\ngovernment\u2019s case. Because no one has a right to a security clearance, the Applicant\nbears a heavy burden of persuasion.\nPersons with access to classified information enter into a fiduciary relationship\nwith the government based on trust and confidence. Therefore, the government has a\ncompelling interest in ensuring each Applicant possesses the requisite judgement,\nreliability, and trustworthiness of those who must protect national interests as their own.\nThe \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any\nreasonable doubt about an Applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the government.2\nAnalysis\nThe government established a case for disqualification under Guideline E, and\nApplicant did not mitigate the security concerns, except regarding the falsification\nallegations. Although I do not consider Applicant to be a particularly persuasive witness,\nhe denied the falsification allegations, shifting the burden to the government to establish\nboth that the answers given were false and were deliberately false. The government\u2019s\nevidence on these points, including recorded statements by Applicant\u2014both sworn and\nunsworn\u2014adequately disclosed the circumstances of these incidents when required to\ndo so. Differences in characterization of actions do not amount to falsification where the\nunderlying facts are disclosed.\nHowever, Applicant\u2019s employment adventures raise serious security concerns.\nDistilled to its essence, Applicant\u2019s misconduct\u2014whether relatively minor (being late to\nwork) or more serious (domestic violence)\u2014demonstrates a consistent pattern of poor\njudgment. He has been unable or unwilling to follow basic norms of behavior in society\nor common sense requirements in the workplace. Compounding these examples of\npoor judgment is his inability or unwillingness to see that these incidents demonstrate\npoor judgment\u2014in itself a demonstration of poor judgment or poor perception.  In his\n3\n\nsafeguard protected information; (d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any other\nguideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse determination, but which, when combined with all\navailable information supports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness,\nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other characteristics\nindicating that the person may not properly safeguard protected information. . . ;\n5\nmind, none of these incidents are really his fault, even partially. It may be that one or\nmore of these incidents were due to petty jealousies or co-worker/supervisor\nincompetence. But when an individual is cited for military misconduct eight times within\nan 18-month period (by six different supervisors), is discharged for that misconduct, and\nleaves employment under adverse circumstances five times in eight years, the\ncredibility of such claims diminishes. Further, Applicant was over 29 years old when this\nmisconduct began, hardly an age where the conduct might be attributed to youthful\nimmaturity.\nAlthough this case is alleged under Guideline E, it is really all about a whole\nperson analysis. Despite the recommendation of his employer and the fact that\nApplicant has not had any recorded incidents since June 2004, his ongoing inability or\nunwillingness to see how his conduct demonstrates poor judgment augurs against a\nwhole person analysis in Applicant\u2019s favor. I resolve Guideline E against Applicant.\nFormal Findings\nParagraph 1.

His omissions on his\nsecurity clearance application concerning his criminal record and financial indebtedness were not\nintentional, but careless, and have been mitigated.  Clearance is granted.\n\n2\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn April 27, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to\nExecutive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2,\n1992, (as amended) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant, which detailed reasons\nwhy DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant and\nrecommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether clearance should be denied\nor revoked.\nThe Applicant responded to the SOR in writing on May 23, 2007, and requested a hearing\nbefore a DOHA Administrative Judge.  This case was assigned to the undersigned on July 23, 2007.\nA notice of hearing was issued on August 3, 2007, scheduling the hearing for August 27, 2007.  At\nthe hearing the Government presented eight exhibits.  The Applicant presented two exhibits and\ntestified on his own behalf.  The record was left open until September 10, 2007 to allow the\nApplicant to submit additional documentation.  The Applicant submitted one Post-Hearing Exhibit,\nconsisting of nine enclosures and nine pages referred to as Applicant\u2019s Post-Hearing Exhibit A\nthrough A(9).  The official transcript (Tr.) was received on September 6, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nThe Applicant is 32 years old, married, and he has a high school diploma.  He is employed\nby a defense contractor as an Aircraft Mechanic and is seeking to obtain his security clearance in\nconnection with his employment.\nThe Government opposes the Applicant's request for a security clearance, on the basis of\nallegations set forth in the Statement of Reasons (SOR).  The following findings of fact are entered\nas to each paragraph and guideline in the SOR:\nParagraph 1 (Guideline F - Financial Considerations)  The Government alleges that the Applicant\nis ineligible for clearance because he is financially overextended and at risk to engage in illegal acts\nto generate funds. \nThe Applicant was an active duty member of the Navy from February 1996 through February\n2003.  In December 2000, he received an Article 15 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice for\nforgery, (violation of UCMJ Article 123); insubordinate conduct toward a warrant officer, non-\ncommissioned officer, or petty officer (violation of UCMJ Article 91); and unauthorized absence\n(violation of UCMJ Article 86).  He was reduced in grade to E-4.  After this pay reduction, which\nreduced his income about $1,000.00 a month, he began to struggle to pay his bills and accumulate\ndebt.  He began to prioritize his bills and only paid what was necessary for survival and to support\nof his family.\n\n3\nThe Applicant became indebted to eight separate creditors for a total of at least $17,686.00.\n(See Government Exhibits 3, 4, 5 and 6).  Although his wife wanted to file Bankruptcy and discharge\ntheir delinquent debts, the Applicant did not want to.  He wanted to be responsible and pay the debts\nthat they owe.  (Tr. p. 53).  With regard to each of the debts listed in the SOR, the Applicant has\nsubmitted documentation showing that he has either paid off the debt or set up a payment plan to\nresolve the debt.  A debt for medical services in the amount of $261.00 was paid in full in August\n2007.  (Applicant\u2019s Post-Hearing Exhibit A(1).)  A settlement agreement in the amount of $3,000.00\nhas been reached for a debt owed to Triad Financial in the amount of $12,862.00.  The $3,000.00\nwill be paid in full no later than September 17, 2007.  (Applicant\u2019s Post-Hearing Exhibit A(2).)  A\ndebt owed to Gateway Community in the amount of $531.00 has been paid in full.  (Applicant\u2019s\nPost-Hearing Exhibit A(3).)  A debt owed to Capital One in the amount of $1,715.00 was settled and\npaid in July 2007.   A debt to HSBC in the amount of $590.00 was paid in full in September 2006.\n(Applicant\u2019s Post-Hearing Exhibit A(4).  A payment arrangement has been reached for a debt owed\nto Palisades, now Penn Credit Corp. allowing the Applicant to pay $114.86 a month that will be\nautomatically deducted out of his checking account on the 4  of each month.   A debt owed to Sprint\nth\nin the amount of $534.00 has been resolved.  \n         \nUpon review of the Applicant\u2019s current  financial picture, he takes home $2,400.00 a month\nfrom his employer, and he receives $222.00 monthly in disability benefits from Veteran Affairs.  His\nwife is a student and is not employed.  They have no children.  After paying his monthly living\nexpenses, he has a small amount left to pay his bills.  Since receiving the SOR, he has been saving\nhis extra money each month and using it to pay his delinquent debts.  \nParagraph 2 (Guideline E - Personal Conduct).  The Government alleges that the Applicant is\nineligible for clearance because he intentionally falsified material aspects of his personal background\nduring the clearance screening process.\nThe Applicant completed a Questionnaire for National Security Positions, otherwise known\nas a security clearance questionnaire, dated March 27, 2006.  Question 23(e) asked if in the last 7\nyears, have you been subject to court marital or other disciplinary proceedings under the Uniform\nCode of Military Justice.  The Applicant answered, \u201cNO\u201d.  (See Government Exhibit 2).  The\nApplicant failed to disclose that on or about December 20, 2000, he was reduced in grade to an E-4\nas a result of non-judicial punishment under Article 15 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice\n(UCMJ) for forgery, (violation of UCMJ Article 123); insubordinate conduct toward a warrant\nofficer, non-commissioned officer, or petty office (violation of UCMJ Article 91); and unauthorized\nabsence (violation of UCMJ Article 86.  \n \nAs to why the Applicant did not reveal his non-judicial punishment in response to question\n23(e), that should have included his captains mast in 2000, he states that he was simply on \u201cauto\nmode\u201d answering \u201cNO\u201d to the questions, because other than this situation, he has no police record\nand has never been in any trouble.  He was not careful in reading the questions before answering\nthem.  He did not realize the question asked him to include a captains mast.  (Tr. pp. 45-46).  \n\n4\nQuestion 28(a), of the same questionnaire asked him if in the last seven years, have you been\nover 180 days delinquent on any debts.   The Applicant answered \u201cYES,\u201d and disclosed one debt.\n(See Government Exhibit 2).  This was not an accurate response.  The Applicant had other\ndelinquent debts he did not list in response to this question.  However, it must be noted that the debt\nhe revealed was the largest delinquent debt he owed and he was obviously not trying to conceal that.\nQuestion 28(b) asked the Applicant if in the last seven years have you been over 90 days delinquent\non any debts.  The Applicant answered, \u201cNO\u201d.  He failed to disclose his delinquent debts set forth\nin the SOR under subparagraphs 1(a) through 1(f) and 1(h). \nThe Applicant credibly testified that when he filled out the application, he was at work.  He\nobviously was not careful in answering the questions.  He stated that he did not reveal any other\ndebts in response to these questions because he was not aware that the debts were on his credit\nreport.  He had never received collection notices from any of the creditors and did not know the\nspecifics of the debts until this background investigation.  Under the particular facts here, I find that\nthe Applicant did not deliberately fail to list his criminal or delinquent financial history on his\nsecurity clearance application.  Accordingly, I find that the Applicant did not deliberately attempt\nto conceal this information from the Government.\nFour letters of recommendation submitted on behalf of the Applicant from his supervisor and\nother professional associates attest to the fact that the Applicant is considered professional,\nresponsible, trustworthy, a person of strong ethical and moral character, a team player and an\ninvaluable asset to the squadron.  (See Applicant\u2019s Post-Hearing Exhibits A(5), A(6), A(7) and\nA(8).) \nPOLICIES\nEnclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudication policies divided into \"Disqualifying\nFactors\" and \"Mitigating Factors.\"  The following Disqualifying Factors and Mitigating Factors are\nfound to be applicable in this case:\nGuideline F (Financial Considerations)\n18.  The Concern.  Failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial\nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and\nregulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and\nability to protect classified information.  An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of\nhaving to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nConditions that could raise a security concern:\n19(a)  inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; \n19(c)  a history of not meeting financial obligation; \n\n5\nConditions that could mitigate security concerns:\n20(b)  the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s\ncontrol, (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death,\ndivorce or separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;\n20(d)  the individual initiated a good faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise\nresolve debts. \nGuideline E (Personal Conduct)\n15.  The Concern.  Conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions about an individual\u2019s\nreliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information.  Of special interest is any\nfailure to provide truthful and candid answers during the security clearance process or any other\nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\nCondition that could raise a security concern:\n16(a)  deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any personnel\nsecurity questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations,\ndetermine employment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance\neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities \nCondition that could mitigate security concerns:\nNone.\nIn addition, as set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive at pages 16-17,  in evaluating the\nrelevance of an individual\u2019s conduct, the Administrative Judge should consider the following general\nfactors:\n a.  The nature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding circumstances\nb.  The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation\nc.  The frequency and recency of the conduct\nd.  The individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct\ne.  The voluntariness of participation\nf.  The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavior changes\n\n6\ng.  The motivation for the conduct \nh. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress\n \ni.  The likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nThe eligibility criteria established in the DoD Directive identify personal characteristics and\nconduct which are reasonably related to the ultimate question, posed in Section 2 of Executive Order\n10865, of whether it is \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d to grant an Applicant\u2019s request\nfor access to classified information.\nThe DoD Directive states, \u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period\nof a person\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the person is an acceptable security risk.\nEligibility for access to classified information is predicted upon the individual meeting these\npersonnel security guidelines.  The adjudicative process is the careful weighing of a number of\nvariables known as the whole person concept.  Available, reliable information about the person, past\nand present, favorable and unfavorable should be considered in reaching a determination.\u201d The\nAdministrative Judge can draw only those inferences or conclusions that have reasonable and logical\nbasis in the evidence of record.  The Judge cannot draw inferences or conclusions based on evidence\nwhich is speculative or conjectural in nature.  Finally, as emphasized by President Eisenhower in\nExecutive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under this order . . . shall be a determination in terms\nof the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the Applicant\nconcerned.\u201d\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn the defense industry, the security of classified industrial secrets is entrusted to civilian\nworkers who must be counted upon to safeguard such sensitive information twenty-four hours per\nday, seven days per week.  The Government is therefore appropriately concerned when available\ninformation indicates that an Applicant for clearance may be involved in instances of financial\nirresponsibility or dishonesty which demonstrates poor judgment or unreliability.\nIt is the Government\u2019s responsibility to present substantial evidence to support the finding\nof a nexus, or rational connection, between the Applicant\u2019s conduct and the holding of a security\nclearance.  If such a case has been established, the burden then shifts to the Applicant to go forward\nwith evidence in rebuttal, explanation or mitigation which is sufficient to overcome or outweigh the\nGovernment\u2019s case.  The Applicant bears the ultimate burden of persuasion in proving that it is\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant his security clearance.\nIn this case the Government has met its initial burden of proving that the Applicant has been\nfinancially irresponsible (Guideline F) and that his security clearance application contains some\ninaccuracies.  (Guideline E).  This evidence indicates poor judgment, unreliability and\n\n7\nuntrustworthiness on the part of the Applicant.  Because of the scope and nature of the Applicant's\nconduct, I conclude there is a nexus or connection with her security clearance eligibility.\nConsidering all of the evidence, the Applicant has introduced persuasive evidence in rebuttal,\nexplanation or mitigation that is sufficient to overcome the Government's case.  With respect to his\nfinances, instead of filing Bankruptcy to dissolve his debts, since receiving the SOR, he has saved\nhis extra money and paid his debts, little by little, and/or set up payment arrangement to do so.  He\nis commended for this showing of integrity and there is evidence of financial rehabilitation.  The\nApplicant has demonstrated that he can properly handle his financial affairs.  Under Guideline F\n(Financial Considerations), Disqualifying Conditions 19(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts,\nand 19(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations apply.  However, Mitigating Conditions\n20(b) the conditions resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g.,\nloss of employment, a business down turn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or\nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances, and 20(d) the individual\ninitiated a good faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts apply.\nAccordingly, I find for the Applicant under Guideline F (Financial Considerations).  \nThe Applicant did not deliberately conceal his criminal or delinquent financial history from\nthe Government in response to questions 23 and 28 on his security clearance application.  Given the\nfact that he was at work when he filled out the application, and obviously in a hurry or pressed for\ntime, he was admittedly careless and did not take time to fill out the questionnaire properly or give\nthe application the required thought process needed to answer the questions correctly.  He did,\nhowever, admit his largest debt although he failed to list others.  Under the particular facts here, the\nApplicant did not deliberately omit any information, he was simply careless.  He has learned from\nthis experience and will be careful to be accurate when  filling out the application in the future.\nAccordingly Guideline E, (Personal Conduct) is found for the Applicant.\nI have also considered the \u201cwhole person concept\u201d in evaluating whether the Applicant meets\nthe qualifications for access to classified information.  The Applicant\u2019s qualities, characteristics and\ncircumstances have been considered.  Except for one isolated incident of non-judicial punishment,\nin 2000, the Applicant served honorably in the United States Navy from 1996 through 2003.  He has\nno police record and other than his delinquent debts that he has resolved for the most part, he has\ndemonstrated that he is a  responsible individual.  He became employed with a defense contractor\nin 2004, and since then has gained the respect of his superiors and peers and is considered a valuable\nasset to the squadron.  Although the Applicant has never before held a security clearance, he\nunderstands the responsibilities that go along with it.  \nOn balance, it is concluded that the Applicant has overcome the Government's case opposing\nhis request for a  security clearance.  Accordingly, the evidence supports a finding for the Applicant\nas to the factual and conclusionary allegations expressed in Paragraphs 1 and 2 for the  Government's\nStatement of Reasons.  \n\n8\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal findings For or Against the Applicant on the allegations in the SOR, as required by\nParagraph 25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive are:\nParagraph 1 For the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1a.:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1 b:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1 c:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1d:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1e:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1f:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1g:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1h:\nFor the Applicant.\nParagraph 2 For the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  2.a.:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  2.b.:\nFor the Applicant.\nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant.\n  Darlene Lokey Anderson\nAdministrative Judge\n",

LYNCH\nAPPEARANCES\nFOR GOVERNMENT\nDaniel F. Crowley, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nBritt Cauthen, Esq.,\nSYNOPSIS\nApplicant has mitigated security concerns arising from the criminal conduct incidents of\ndomestic violence through the passage of time and rehabilitation. Applicant also mitigated the\nalcohol consumption security concerns. Applicant's eligibility for a security clearance is granted.\n\nGX 1(Application of Security Clearance (SF 86), dated November 10, 2004).\n1\nThis action was taken under Executive Order 10865, dated February 20, 1960, as amended, and DoD Directive\n2\n5220.6, dated January 2, 1992, as amended and modified (Directive).\nApplicant, through his counsel, waived the 15 day notice requirement.\n3\nApplicant\u2019s Answer to SOR, dated July 25, 2007.\n4\nGX 1 (Application for Security Clearance (SF 86), dated November 10, 2004).\n5\nId.\n6\n2\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn November 10, 2004, Applicant completed his security clearance (SF 86) application.1\nOn July 3, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of\nReasons (SOR) to Applicant.  The SOR alleges security concerns under Guideline J (Criminal\n2\nConduct) and Guideline G (Alcohol Consumption) of the revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG)\nissued on December 29, 2005, and implemented by the Department of  Defense effective September\n1, 2006. The revised guidelines were provided to Applicant when the SOR was issued. The SOR\ndetailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary finding under the Directive that it is\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for him, and\nrecommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted,\ncontinued, denied, or revoked.\nOn July 25, 2007, Applicant submitted a notarized response to the SOR allegations, and\nelected to have his case decided at a hearing. On August 29, 2007, the case was assigned to me. A\nNotice of Hearing was issued on September 14, 2007.  At the scheduled hearing, conducted by video\n3\nteleconference, on September 20, 2007, the Government introduced five Government Exhibits (GX)\n1-5 into evidence without objections. Applicant testified and introduced Applicant Exhibits (AX)\nA-E into evidence without objections from Department Counsel. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.)\non September 28, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nApplicant admitted allegations in subparagraphs 1.a -h, and subparagraphs 2.a-b in his SOR\nresponse under Guideline J and Guideline G with explanation.  After a complete review of the\n4\nevidence in the record and upon due consideration, I make the following findings of fact:\nApplicant is a 36-year-old employee of a defense contractor. After receiving his GED in\n1977, he worked for various companies. He has worked for his current employer since November\n2002.   He is twice divorced with two children.   \n5\n6\n\nGX 2 (Criminal History Printout).\n7\nId.\n8\nTr. 73.\n9\nTr. 31.\n10\nTr. 40-43.\n11\n3\nApplicant started drinking when he was approximately 18 years old. In 1988, Applicant was\ndriving a motorcycle and was pulled over by the police. He was charged with driving under the\ninfluence of liquor. He was found guilty, and sentenced to pay a fine and court costs.7\nIn 1989, Applicant was charged with larceny of property 2  degree. He was found guilty,\nnd\nsentenced to two years confinement (suspended), with two years probation. This incident occurred\nwhen he walked into a stereo store intending to shoplift. He took a radio/cd changer and hid it under\nhis jacket. On his way out of the store, he decided to put it back. When he pled guilty, he did not\nhave a lawyer and was not aware of the youthful offender act. Nonetheless, Applicant admits the\nincident and was convicted.8\nOn July 1, 1990, Applicant was charged with driving under the influence of liquor. He was\nfound guilty, sentenced to pay a fine, and court costs. This incident occurred during the July 4th\nweekend. Applicant was driving in a campground when his friend almost fell out of the car after\nleaning on the door. Applicant reached out to grab him and the car swerved. A police officer stopped\nApplicant and after smelling alcohol on his breath gave him the alcohol test which he failed.9\nApplicant married his second wife in 1999. His second marriage was a deeply troubled one.\nHe traveled a great deal of time for work and his wife did not work. His wife often left the home and\nused drugs. She was addicted to various drugs and her behavior was often erratic. Applicant\nacknowledged smoking marijuana with his wife on a regular basis. They also drank heavily and often\nfrequented bars. During this marriage, Applicant was involved in following domestic violence\nincidents.10\nIn 2001, Applicant was charged with assault 2  degree. This incident occurred in a nightclub.\nnd\nApplicant\u2019s wife complained to him that someone was bothering her on the dance floor. Applicant\nadvised his wife to remain with him, however, she did not. She pointed out the male who was\nharassing her to her husband (Applicant). When Applicant walked over the man and tapped him on\nthe shoulder, the man pushed Applicant three times. Applicant had a beer in his hand and swung it\nat the man.  When Applicant left the bar, he was approached by the police. Applicant explained the\nsituation and both men agreed not to press charges.  About a month later, Applicant was charged\nwith assault. At that time he had a marijuana joint in his pocket. He was later charged with\nsmuggling contraband and promoting prison contraband. He was convicted, sentenced to six months\nconfinement, six years six months suspended, three years probation and fined. The smuggling\ncontraband charges were nolle prossed.11\nOn March 28, 2002, Applicant was charged with domestic violence 3  harassment. This case\nrd\nwas nolle prossed with conditions. This incident occurred when Applicant\u2019s wife left home to get\n\nTr. 33-34.\n12\nTr. 36.\n13\nTr. 37.\n14\nGX 5 (Answers to Interrogatories, dated May 2007).\n15\nAX D and E (Certificate of Completion and Progress Notes from therapist, dated 2003-2004).\n16\n4\ndrugs and left the children alone. Applicant went to retrieve his wife. He decided to go home and get\nthe children and leave with them. She returned to the home as they were leaving. Applicant\u2019s wife\ntried to stop the car that was backing out of the driveway. She jumped into the car and fought with\nApplicant to gain control of the steering wheel. A neighbor witnessed this and alerted the police.\nApplicant was stopped a short distance from home. He was pulled over and the officer told Applicant\nthat he should leave the children with his wife. Applicant refused but the police officer gave an\nultimatum. Applicant refused to do so and was put in jail. 12\nOn April 11, 2002, Applicant was arrested and charged with domestic violence 3  degree-\nrd\nassault -menacing. This case was nolle prossed with conditions. This incident occurred when he was\nseparated from his wife. They had an altercation at a public place and a friend of his wife\u2019s\nthreatened Applicant.  Applicant followed his wife and her friend for the purpose of taking pictures\nof them. A little while after this, Applicant was stopped by a county sheriff. The sheriff had a report\nthat Applicant had a gun and had threatened his wife and her male friend. Applicant did not have a\ngun and the charges were dismissed.13\nOn May 5, 2002, Applicant was charged with domestic violence. He and his second wife had\ngone to a concert. His wife was drinking and became belligerent.  They got into a heated argument,\nand he learned that she was having an affair. She was in the car with him and attempted to use the\ncell phone. Applicant was angry and reached over to knock the phone out of her hand. He \u201cbusted\u201d\nher nose.\u201d  Before reaching home, they stopped at a public restroom and Applicant\u2019s wife went in\n14\nthe building. A security guard saw her and called the police. Applicant went to jail for 72 hours and\nwas released. Applicant was sentenced to six months but was released early for good behavior.  \n15\nIn 2003, Applicant divorced his second wife. He realized his wife was addicted to drugs and\nthat she was having an affair. He loved her but realized he would not be able to change her. He made\nthe choice to turn his life around.\nOn January 23, 2004, Applicant was charged with driving under the influence of alcohol. The\ncharge was nolle prossed, with conditions, and Applicant was sentenced to pay court costs. This\nincident occurred after Applicant started his treatment program. However, Applicant explained his\nex-wife was harassing him. He went to a bar and then took a taxi to his car. He then drove home.\nFrom November 2003, until June 2004, Applicant received treatment for alcohol and drugs.\nHe does not have a diagnosis for alcohol abuse or dependence. He also completed an anger\nmanagement program. No further treatment was required. During this period, Applicant realized he\nneeded to stop using marijuana. He then stopped drinking and smoking marijuana because he wanted\nto save himself and gain custody of his son.  \n16\n\nAX C (Letter from Church Pastor, dated September 18, 2007).\n17\nTr. 49.\n18\nAX A (Letter from President of company, dated 2007).\n19\nTr. 91.\n20\n Department of the Navy v.

They both attend church and are\ninvolved in community activities.  Applicant received custody of his son. He acknowledges that he\n17\nand his current wife occasionally drink on a special occasion. He does not drink and drive.18\nApplicant works for a technology engineering service. The president of the company highly\nrecommends Applicant for a security clearance.  Applicant is a senior computer engineer. He is\n19\nhighly respected for his work. He is considered one of the foremost web developers in the country.\nHis company president vouches for his character and reputation. In the years of employment,\nApplicant has never had any difficulty at work.20\nPOLICIES\nThe President has \u201cthe authority to . . . control access to information bearing on national\nsecurity and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position \u2026 that\nwill give that person access to such information.\u201d   In Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\n21\nClassified Information Within Industry (Feb. 20, 1960), the President set out guidelines and\nprocedures for safeguarding classified information and determining trustworthiness within the\nexecutive branch. \nTo be eligible for a security clearance or access to sensitive information, an applicant must\nmeet the security guidelines contained in the Directive.  The revised Adjudicative Guidelines set forth\npotentially disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) under each guideline.\nAdditionally, each security decision must be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based on the\nrelevant and material facts and circumstances, the whole-person concept, along with the adjudicative\nprocess factors listed in \u00b6 6.3 of the Directive, and AG \u00b6 2(a).\n\u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make\nan affirmative determination that the person is eligible for a security clearance.\u201d    An administrative\n22\njudge must apply the \u201cwhole person concept,\u201d and consider and carefully weigh the available, reliable\ninformation about the person.   An administrative judge should consider the following factors: (1)\n23\nthe nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to\ninclude knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\n\n Id.\n24\n Directive, \u00b6 E3.1.14.\n25\n Directive, \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n26\n ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd.

An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent\n26\nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d  Any doubt as to whether\n27\naccess to classified information is clearly consistent with national security will be resolved in favor\nof the national security.28\nThe scope of an administrative judge\u2019s decision is limited. Nothing in this Decision should\nbe construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole or in part, on any express or implied\ndeterminations as to Applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or patriotism.\nCONCLUSIONS\nI have carefully considered all the facts in evidence and the legal standards discussed above.\nI reach the following conclusions regarding the allegations in the SOR.\n \nGuideline J: Criminal Conduct\nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness.\nBy its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules\nand regulations. \nCriminal Conduct Disqualifying Condition (CC DC) AG \u00b6 31(a) (a single serious crime or\nmultiple lesser offenses) and CC DC AG \u00b6 31(c) (allegations or admission of criminal conduct,\nregardless of whether the person was formally charged, formally prosecuted or convicted) applies.\nApplicant admitted the domestic violence charges and his alcohol-related driving offenses. Despite\nthe fact that some of the charges were dismissed, he either pled guilty or was convicted on others.\nMitigating Condition (MC CC) AG \u00b6 32(a) (so much time elapsed since the criminal behavior\nhappened, or it happened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not\ncast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment) partially applies in this\n\n7\ncase. Applicant\u2019s convictions for domestic violence occurred when he was married to his second wife.\nHis wife was addicted to drugs and the relationship was highly charged. The last incident was in 2002.\nHowever, his domestic situation has drastically improved since that time. Applicant is divorced from\nhis second wife. He remarried in 2005 and the court gave him custody of his son.\nApplicant\u2019s marriage was in crisis for a period of years. Applicant made bad choices during\nthe marriage to keep the family together for his son. His wife put pressure on Applicant, which\nadversely affected his judgment and ability to adhere to the law. He now has custody of his son and\nhis second wife is no longer part of his life. MC CC AG \u00b6 32(b) (the person was pressured or coerced\ninto committing the act and those pressures are no longer present in the person\u2019s life) partially applies.\nMC DC AG \u00b6 32(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited to\nthe passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or restitution, job training or\nhigher education, good employment record, or constructive community involvement) applies.\nApplicant completed an anger management class and alcohol and drug psychological-educational\nprogram. He has persevered because he wants to provide a good, safe home for his son. He has been\nvery successful in his work. He has not mishandled classified information or sensitive information and\nhas garnered promotions and praise. He is active in his church and his community.\nGuideline G: Alcohol Consumption\nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment or the\nfailure to control impulses, and can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability and\ntrustworthiness.\nIn this matter, the government provided substantial evidence that Applicant was arrested in\n1988, and 1989 for under age alcohol-related driving incidents. His last alcohol incident was in 2004.\nConsequently, Alcohol Consumption Disqualifying Condition (AC DC) AG \u00b6 22(b) alcohol-related\nincidents away from work, such as driving under the influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse,\ndisturbing the peace, or other incidents of concern, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed\nas an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent applies.\nApplicant admitted consuming alcohol, at times to excess and to the point of intoxication, from\napproximately 1998 until at least May 2007. AC DC AG \u00b6 22(c) habitual or binge consumption of\nalcohol to the point of impaired judgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an\nalcohol abuser or alcohol dependent applies.\nWith the government\u2019s case initially established, the burden shifts to Applicant to present\nevidence of refutation, extenuation, or mitigation to overcome the case against him. I considered the\nAlcohol Consumption Mitigating Condition (AC MC) AG \u00b6 23 (a) so much time has passed, or the\nbehavior was so infrequent, or it happened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to\nrecur or does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\nApplicant\u2019s 1988 and 1989 under age drinking are very remote in time. Applicant asserted that\nhis drinking no longer plays a major role in his life. He does acknowledge that he drinks on a special\noccasion but does not drink and drive. His driving incident involving alcohol was in 2004. He has\nsince moderated his drinking and is no longer married to his second wife. He does not associate with\n\n8\nfriends or associates who drink heavily. His current employer has traveled with Applicant and attests\nto the fact that Applicant has never had alcohol at work or on his travels with Applicant. Applicant\u2019s\nheaviest drinking occurred during his second marriage. He has completed an alcohol education\nprogram. Applicant\u2019s personal life has changed sufficiently that he is now less likely to find himself\nin the same circumstances that led to his alcohol use and related misconduct. I conclude this guideline\nfor Applicant.\nWhole Person\nIn all adjudications, the protection of our national security is the paramount concern. The\nobjective of the trustworthy determination process is the fair-minded, commonsense assessment of a\nperson\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the person is eligible for assignment to sensitive\nduties. Indeed, the adjudicative process is a careful weighing of a number of variables in considering\nthe \u201cwhole person\u201d concept. It recognizes that we should view a person by the totality of their acts,\nomissions, motivations and other variables. Each case must be adjudged on its own merits, taking into\nconsideration all relevant circumstances, and applying sound judgment, mature thinking, and careful\nanalysis.\nI have considered all the evidence and the \u201cwhole person\u201d in evaluating Applicant\u2019s security\nclearance determination. Applicant had problems in his youth with alcohol. He married at an early age,\ndivorced and then remarried in 1999. His second marriage was a disaster. During the course of that\nmarriage, he was involved in a number of domestic violence incidents. His wife was addicted to drugs\nand Applicant remained married or in a relationship with his troubled spouse. He attempted to reduce\nthe impact of his wife\u2019s erratic behavior on their family for the sake of his son.  Applicant extricated\nhimself from that marriage. Since the divorce in 2003, Applicant has not had any instances of domestic\nviolence. He is now married to a woman who helps him take care of his son. The court awarded\nApplicant the custody of his son. Applicant has an exemplary record of employment. He is mature and\nresponsible at work and has earned promotions and the praise of the company president who appeared\nand testified on his behalf. Applicant also successfully completed a rehabilitation program. He now\nhas a good family and community support system. His third marriage is stable. His professional life\nis replete with commendations. His current employer of five years reports no attendance problems,\nirresponsibility or dishonesty. He is deemed trustworthy in his work. Applicant has overcome the\ndoubts about his ability to exercise the requisite judgment and discretion expected of one who holds\na security clearance.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal Findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required\nby Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1.

LEONARD\nAPPEARANCES\nFOR GOVERNMENT\nMelvin A. Howry, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nSYNOPSIS\nFederal and state tax authorities are pursuing Applicant for nearly $200,000 in deficiency\namounts for tax years 2002, 2003, and 2004. In an audit in 2007, the IRS concluded that Applicant\u2019s\nhorse business is a hobby or not-for-profit business and determined he was not entitled to claim\nbusiness expenses for those three years. Applicant disagrees and contends that his horse business is\na viable, for-profit business. He is making a good-faith effort to resolve the tax problem by appealing\nunder the process authorized by law. If he does not prevail, he believes he can repay the tax\ndeficiencies by selling off the assets of the horse business. Applicant is not a tax protestor, he is not\ntax defiant, and he is not engaged in tax evasion or fraud. The potential for pressure, coercion,\nexploitation, or duress in a security-clearance context is remote. Clearance is granted.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\n\n Executive Order 10865, dated February 20, 1960, as amended, and DoD Directive 5220.6, dated January 2,\n1\n1992, as amended (Directive).\n See Memorandum from the Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence, dated August 30, 2006, Subject:\n2\nImplementation of Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information (December\n29, 2005). \n2\nThis is a security clearance case. Applicant contests the Defense Department\u2019s intent to deny\nor revoke his eligibility for a security clearance. Acting under the relevant Executive Order and DoD\nDirective,  the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a statement of reasons\n1\n(SOR) to Applicant on June 7, 2007. The SOR is equivalent to an administrative complaint and it\ndetails the factual basis for the action. The issues in this case fall under Guideline F for financial\nconsiderations based on federal and state tax deficiencies and three delinquent debts for less than\n$700 in total.     \nIn addition to the Directive, this case is brought under the revised Adjudicative Guidelines\nfor Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information (Revised Guidelines) approved by\nthe President on December 29, 2005. The Revised Guidelines were then modified by the Defense\nDepartment, effective September 1, 2006. They supersede or replace the guidelines published in\nEnclosure 2 to the Directive. They apply to all adjudications and other determinations where an SOR\nhas been issued on September 1, 2006, or thereafter.  The Directive is pending revision or\n2\namendment. The Revised Guidelines apply here because the SOR is dated after the effective date.\nOn June 18, 2007, Applicant replied to the SOR and indicated he did not wish to have a\nhearing. Subsequently, Applicant changed his mind and requested a hearing on August 6, 2007. The\nhearing took place on November 13, 2007, and the transcript was received on November 21, 2007.\nThe record was left open until November 30  to allow Applicant to submit additional items\nth\nof documentary evidence. Those items were timely received and are admitted without objections as\nfollows: (1) Exhibit E\u2013DD Form 214 and related paperwork; (2) Exhibit F\u2013IRS letter; and (3)\nExhibit G\u2013letter from tax advisor.   \nFINDINGS OF FACT\nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the factual allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, and 1.c,\nand he denies the allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.d, 1.e, and 1.f. Based on the record evidence as a whole, the\nfollowing facts are established by substantial evidence. \nApplicant is a 63-year-old executive who works in the defense industry. He holds both a\nbachelor\u2019s degree and an MBA. He is a retired Navy captain (pay grade 06) having served\napproximately 26 years of active and reserve duty. He is active in a local chapter of the Navy League.\nIn the past, he has held a security clearance issued by the Navy. In August 2006, he submitted a\nsecurity-clearance application seeking to obtain an industrial security clearance (Exhibit 1).\nThis case stems from Applicant\u2019s horse business\u2014which is separate from his employment\nin the defense industry\u2014and an ongoing tax dispute.  The business breeds, raises, trains, competes,\n\n3\nand sells reining horses and working cow horses, and it currently has approximately 25 horses\navailable for sale (Exhibit B). Applicant estimates that he has invested approximately $600,000 of\nhis own money into the business (R. 32). The business did not show a profit for 2002, 2003, and\n2004, the tax years in question. It had a profit of less than $10,000 in 2006, and Applicant expects\nto show a larger profit in 2007. \nFederal and state tax authorities are pursuing Applicant for nearly $200,000 in deficiency\namounts for tax years 2002\u20132004. In 2004, the IRS placed a federal tax lien against Applicant for\n$64,822 (Exhibit 6). The state tax authority followed suit in 2006 and 2007 when it placed tax liens\nagainst Applicant for $2,847 and $27,539 (Exhibits 7 and 8). The state\u2019s action essentially\npiggybacks on the IRS action. The most recent information from the IRS indicates the federal tax\ndeficiency is about $145,863 in total (Exhibit F). Likewise, the state tax deficiency is now\napproximately $52,317 in total (Exhibit 10 and R. 57). \nAfter an audit in May\u2013June 2007, the IRS concluded that Applicant\u2019s horse business is a\nhobby or not-for-profit business and determined he was not entitled to claim Schedule F business\nexpenses for those three years (Exhibits F and G). The IRS notified Applicant of its decision by letter\nin July 2007 (Exhibit F). \nApplicant disagrees with the IRS\u2019s decision. He contends that his horse business is a viable,\nfor-profit business, and he is appealing under the process authorized by law. His case was received\nfor consideration by the local IRS Appeals Office in September 2007 (Exhibit D).  The tax advisory\nfirm who prepares Applicant\u2019s tax returns, to include his horse business, has been retained to\nrepresent him in the appeal with the IRS (Exhibit G). According to the president of the firm, an\nenrolled agent, the normal time line for an appeal is 18 to 30 months and Applicant\u2019s appeal will\nbe decided sometime in 2009 (Exhibit G). If Applicant does not win his appeal to the IRS Appeals\nOffice, he intends to take his case to U.S. Tax Court. Ultimately, if he does not prevail, he believes\nhe can repay the tax deficiencies by selling off the assets of the horse business (R. 52\u201354). \nIn addition to the tax deficiencies, the SOR alleges three delinquent debts for less than $700\nin total. Two of the debts are for medical bills for $277 and $181. The other debt is a collection\naccount for $171. Applicant agrees that these are his accounts, but contends he does not owe any\nmoney on the accounts. He disputes liability for the medical accounts because he believes the matters\nwere covered by insurance (he has both Tricare as a retired military officer and  insurance via his\nemployer). He has given the medical service providers his insurance information and told them to\nresolve it with the insurance provider. He disputes liability for the collection account because of a\ndisagreement over telephone services or equipment. He did not provide any paperwork to document\nhis disputes for these three accounts. \nGENERAL PRINCIPLES OF LAW AND POLICIES\n\n Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988) (\u201cit should be obvious that no one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a\n3\nsecurity clearance\u201d); Duane v.

Dec. 19, 2002) (citations omitted).\n12\n4\nNo one has a right to a security clearance.  As noted by the Supreme Court in Department\n3\nof Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe clearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations\nshould err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d  A favorable decision establishes eligibility of an\n4\napplicant to be granted a security clearance for access to confidential, secret, or top-secret\ninformation.  An unfavorable decision: (1) denies any application; (2)  revokes any existing security\n5\nclearance; and (3) prevents access to classified information at any level and retention of any existing\nsecurity clearance.  Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive, any doubt about whether\n6\nan applicant should be allowed access to classified information will be resolved in favor of\nprotecting national security.\nThere is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for access\nto classified information.  The government has the burden of presenting evidence to establish facts\n7\nalleged in the SOR that have been controverted.  An applicant is responsible for presenting evidence\n8\nto refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts that have been admitted or proven.  In addition, an\n9\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.  In Egan,\n10\nthe Supreme Court said that the burden of proof is less than the preponderance of the evidence.  The\n11\nagency appellate authority has followed the Court\u2019s reasoning, and a judge\u2019s findings of fact are\nreviewed under the substantial-evidence standard.12\nThe Revised Guidelines set forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when evaluating a\nperson\u2019s security clearance eligibility, including disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating\nconditions (MC) for each guideline. In addition, each clearance decision must be a fair and impartial\ncommonsense decision based upon consideration of all the relevant and material information, the\npertinent criteria and adjudication factors, and the whole-person concept. A person granted access\nto classified information enters into a special relationship with the government. The government\nmust be able to have a high degree of trust and confidence in those persons to whom it grants access\nto classified information. The decision to deny a person a security clearance is not a determination\n\n Executive Order 10865, \u00a7 7.\n13\n Revised Guidelines at pp. 13\u201314 (setting forth the disqualifying and mitigating conditions). \n14\n Revised Guidelines at p. 13. \n15\n \u201c De minimis is a shortened form of the Latin maxim de minimis non curat lex (= the law does not concern\n16\nitself with trifles).\u201d Bryan A.

Instead, it is a determination that the applicant has not met the strict\n13\nguidelines the President has established for granting eligibility for a security clearance.\nCONCLUSIONS\nUnder Guideline F for financial considerations,  a security concern typically exists due to\n14\nsignificant unpaid debts. \u201cFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by\nrules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability,\ntrustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information. An individual who is finally\noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.\u201d  Similarly, an\n15\nindividual who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, unconcerned, negligent, or\ncareless in properly handling and safeguarding classified information. \nStarting with the matters in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d, 1.e, and 1.f, the three delinquent debts for less than\n$700 in total are not of particular security concern. Viewed individually, in the aggregate, and in\nconjunction with the tax problem, these three debts do not rise to the level of a bonafide security\nconcern. First, the amounts are minor if not de minimis.  Second, it is highly unlikely that these three\n16\ndebts could interfere with Applicant\u2019s ability to properly handle and safeguard classified information.\nThird, the two unpaid medical debts in particular have negligible security value. Experience in the\nways of the world teaches that medical billing can be problematic, even when a consumer is covered\nby insurance. Confusion and disputes between consumers, doctors and hospitals, and insurers are\nnot uncommon. A dispute over a couple of minor medical debts is not generally reflective of a\nperson\u2019s ability or willingness to repay or of a person\u2019s financial responsibility. To sum up, the two\nunpaid medical debts and the collection account suggest that Applicant is a typical consumer who\nhas a few disputed accounts, and the three accounts do not suggest that Applicant is an unsuitable\nor high-risk candidate for a security clearance. \nTurning next to the gravamen of the SOR, which is Applicant\u2019s tax problem as set forth in\nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, and 1.c. The record evidence supports a conclusion that Applicant has a history of\nfinancial problems. The state and federal tax liens and tax deficiencies (now approaching $200,000\nin total) establish a history of not meeting financial obligations  and raise a security concern within\n17\nthe meaning of Guideline F.  \nAll of the mitigating conditions under Guideline F have been considered and two deserve\ndiscussion. The two applicable MC are:  \n\n6\nMC2: [T]he conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the\nperson\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical\nemergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual acted responsibly\nunder the circumstances; and\nMC 4: [T]he individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or\notherwise resolve the debts.\nFirst, MC 2 applies because Applicant\u2019s ongoing tax problem is due to an unexpected\nbusiness problem. He did not incur the tax problem by frivolous or irresponsible spending on a\ncredit-card binge, deceptive or illegal financial practices, failure to file income-tax returns or\nfraudulent filing of the same, or some other misfeasance or malfeasance. Instead, the facts and\ncircumstances show that Applicant has a complicated business problem on his hands. He has  acted\nresponsibly under the circumstances by going through the IRS audit and appealing the audit\u2019s result.\nSecond, MC 4 applies under a similar rationale. He is taking steps  to resolve the ongoing\ntax problem by retaining representation and appealing under the process allowed by law. His actions\nare wholly lawful, and they are the actions of a reasonable businessperson in the same or similar\nsituation. If unsuccessful, Applicant believes he could resolve the tax problem by selling the assets\nof his horse business and using the proceeds to repay (R. 52\u201354). On this point, Applicant testified\nthat the horses have an average value of $12,000 to $13,000 each. A sale would produce a gross\namount of $312,500 if Applicant sold all 25 horses at an average of $12,500 each. Given these\ncircumstances, Applicant\u2019s actions are sufficient to qualify as a good-faith effort within the meaning\nof Guideline F.  \nTo sum up under the whole-person concept, this case presents both disqualifying and\nmitigating information, which requires thoughtful balancing. First, Applicant is 63 years old and\nsufficiently mature to make prudent decisions about his finances, money-management practices, and\nhorse business. Second, he is in the middle of an ongoing tax dispute. He may or may not prevail.\nIf he does, the tax liens and tax deficiencies will go away. If not, he will be required to repay the tax\ndeficiencies and it appears he may have sufficient assets to do so. Third, the evidence shows that\nApplicant is not a tax protestor, he is not tax defiant, and he is not engaged in tax evasion or fraud.\nFourth, Applicant has years of honorable military service and retired as a Navy captain. This\ncircumstance strongly suggests that Applicant has the requisite self-control, good judgment,\nreliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information. And fifth, the potential for\npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress in a security-clearance context is remote. The chances of\nfederal or state tax authorities using the ongoing tax dispute as leverage or blackmail material against\nApplicant to obtain classified information are approximately zero. Likewise, it is highly improbable\nthat a third party would first discover and then attempt to use the ongoing tax dispute as leverage\nagainst Applicant. Neither scenario is realistic. \nFinally, this clearance decision should not be construed as addressing the legitimacy,\nsubstance, or merit of Applicant\u2019s tax dispute. It does not. Those matters are beyond the scope and\njurisdiction of this administrative proceeding, which is limited to determining Applicant\u2019s eligibility\nfor a security clearance. \n\n7\nAfter weighing the record evidence as a whole, Applicant has successfully explained,\nextenuated, or mitigated the financial considerations security concern. And Applicant has overcome\nthe case against him and satisfied his ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance\ndecision. Accordingly, Guideline F is decided for Applicant.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nSOR \u00b6 1\u2013Guideline F:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraphs a\u2013f:\nFor Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances, it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or\ncontinue eligibility for a security clearance for Applicant.

Clearance\nis granted.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nOn June 6, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement\nof Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its decision to deny a security clearance for Applicant.  The\naction was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry\n(February 20, 1990), as amended, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial\nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive).  The new\nadjudicative guidelines, promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective in the\nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006, will be used to adjudicate this case.\nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on June 15, 2007.  The SOR alleges security concerns\nunder Guideline B (Foreign Influence), and Guideline C (Foreign Preference) of the Directive.\nApplicant answered the SOR in writing through counsel on June 25, 2007.  He admitted four\nand denied one of the factual allegations under Guideline C, and admitted all factual allegations\nunder Guideline B.  He provided a detailed explanation of his security worthiness position with his\nresponse.  He requested a hearing before an administrative judge, and the request was received by\nDOHA on June 26, 2007.  Department Counsel was prepared to proceed with the case on July 24,\n2007, and the case was assigned to me on July 26, 2007.  A notice of hearing was issued on July 27,\n2007, and the hearing was convened on August 23, 2007.  One government exhibits and two\nApplicant exhibits were received without objection.  The testimony of five Applicant witnesses, and\nthe Applicant were received during the hearing.  The transcript (Tr.) was received by DOHA on\nSeptember 4, 2007.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nAfter a thorough review of the pleadings, transcript, and exhibits, I make the following\nessential findings of fact.\nApplicant is a 52-year-old electrical engineer employed by a defense contractor as a test\nengineer.  He was born in Tehran, Iran, completed high school there, and came to the United States\nin 1977 for a college education.  He was initially supported in his education by Iran, but the support\nceased in 1979 when the Shah was overthrown.  Applicant held different jobs to support himself and\ncomplete his education.  He received his bachelor\u2019s degree in electrical engineer in 1985 from a\nUnited States university, and became a United States citizen in 1986.  At the time, he changed his\nname from an Iranian name to a more American sounding name.  Applicant is not religious and does\nnot follow religious customs from Iran.  He does not observe dietary restrictions or prohibitions\n\nTr. 80-81.\n1\nTr. 120-121.\n2\nTr. 108-110.\n3\nTr. 94.\n4\nTr. 105-108; Applicant Exhibit A (Letter, dated June 21, 2007).\n5\nTr. 82.\n6\nTr. 81-86, 122-151; See, Government Exhibit 1 (Security Clearance Application, dated November 22, 2004).\n7\nTr. 103-105.\n8\n3\nagainst use of things like alcohol.   He completed the compulsory Iranian miliary duty serving in the\n1\nmedical field before leaving Iran.   \n2\nApplicant married a United States citizen while in school in 1980 , but his wife was killed\nin an automobile accident in 1981.  He had a daughter by another woman, his common law wife, in\n1983.  Applicant, his common-law wife, and their daughter lived together for about 13 years until\nApplicant separated from his family.  The child lived with her mother after the separation. He\ncommunicates with his daughter who is now a college student.   \n3\nApplicant has no financial interests in Iran.  All of his financial interests are in the United\nStates.  He votes in United States government elections.   Applicant took the steps to renounce his\n4\nIranian citizenship by sending a letter to the Iranian interest section of the Pakistan Embassy in the\nUnited States.  This is the procedure to renounce citizenship under Articles 41 and 42 of the Iranian\nConstitution.  Applicant just learned of the procedure recently.  If he had known about it earlier, he\nwould have submitted the letter earlier.  He took this action without reservation and knows he can\nnever go back to Iran.   He can think of nothing good about Iran.  He knows things are in turmoil in\n5\nthat country.6\nUpon completion of college and being granted a degree, Applicant went to work for a defense\ncontractor working in missile design and production.  He has continued to work for government\ncontractors, mostly in the missile area.  Applicant has held a security clearance since 1989.  He\nsubmitted a security clearance application for a periodic review of his security eligibility in 2004.7\nApplicant has received numerous security briefings and training by his various government\ncontractor employers.  Applicant knows to report any attempt to coerce he or his present wife to his\ncompany security officer and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI).8\nApplicant\u2019s father and three sisters are citizens and residents of Iran.  His father is an 81-year-\nold retired tailor who never worked for the Iran government.  His mother died in 2005.  One of his\nthree younger sisters owns a beauty shop, another is a secretary, and the third is a teacher.  They are\nall married but he is not sure of their husbands\u2019 occupations.  He also has an uncle, a retired tailor,\nhe has spoken to only once in 2000 since he left Iran in 1977.  After the fall of the Shah until 2000,\nhe had little contact with his family.  He did not have the financial resources to make many calls to\nhis family.  Applicant and his family felt he would have to go to jail or fight in the Iran/Iraq war if\n\nTr. 112.\n9\nTr. 110-113.\n10\nTr. 136-140.\n11\nTr. 150-152.\n12\nTr. 85-86, 90-92, 107-108, 146-148.\n13\nTr. 92-93, 141-143.\n14\nTr. 110-114, 145-146.\n15\n4\nhe returned to Iran.   The family did not want to endanger Applicant\u2019s position in the United States.\n9\n10\nHe had pleasant conversations with his family prior to his mother\u2019s death in 2005.  He did not attend\nher funeral, because he did not want to jeopardize his life in the United States.  His failure to attend\nher funeral alienated him from his family since he was the oldest son and expected to attend.  His\ncontacts with his family since have been minimal, once or twice a year by phone, usually initiated\nby the family members.  They usually leave a message, and he usually responds to them a few\nmonths later.  He was not proactive in calling them because they are not happy he has alienated\nhimself from the family.  His last conversation with them was in March 2007 when they called him\nfor the Persian New Year.11\nOther than his father and sisters in Iran, the rest of Applicant\u2019s extended family is in the\nUnited States.  He has three aunts who are long time residents and citizens of the United States.\nThey were here when Applicant arrived in 1977.  He has a number of cousins who are also citizens\nand residents of the United States.   Applicant\u2019s parents visited the United States in 1999 and in\n12\napproximately 2003.  They did not stay with Applicant but with his aunt.  He did visit his parents\nat his aunt\u2019s house during their stay.  \n13\nApplicant admitted that while his mother was alive, he periodically sent his family money\nto assist with his mother\u2019s medical care.  The payments total about $4,000 to $5,000 per year.  He\nhas not sent any money since his mother passed away and does not intend to send money in the\nfuture.  \n14\nApplicant initially entered the United States in 1977 with an Iranian passport on a student\nvisa.  Applicant received a United States passport when he became a citizen in 1986.  He periodically\nrenewed his Iranian passport because he did not know it was not proper to also hold another\ncountry\u2019s passport.  He last renewed the Iranian passport in 1997.  He used his United States passport\nfor all travel other than to Iran.  He used the Iranian passport to enter Iran in 2000 and 2001.  His\nlatest Iranian passport expired in March 2007 and has been destroyed.   \n15\nSince he left Iran in 1977, Applicant returned 24 years later, twice in 2000 and once in 2001.\nApplicant was getting older and wanted a family.  His sisters told him they knew of a woman in Iran\nfor him.  He visited the woman and her family for two weeks in 2000, and returned later the same\nyear to marry her.  He returned again for a few days in 2001 for a more formal wedding.   He stayed\nwith his parents while on his visits and his sisters visited him at the home of their parents.  He never\n\nTr. 90-93.\n16\nTr. 87-88.  Applicant presented three articles on the use of individuals to obtain intelligence for the purpose\n17\nof establishing for administrative notice purposes that an individual like Applicant returning to his native country can\nbe a source of intelligence.  Two of the articles dealt with double agents and had no relevance to the circumstance of\nApplicant\u2019s relationships in Iran.  See, Court Exhibit IV, Psychology of Treason, 1986, and Court Exhibit V,\nObservations on the Double Agent, 1962.  The third article is more relevant to Applicant\u2019s circumstances because it deals\nwith the use of domestic companies, academics, or individuals traveling abroad as intelligence sources.  See, Court\nExhibit VI, Techniques of Domestic Intelligence Collection, 1959.  However, even this article is not sufficient to\nestablish any facts that rise to the level to be considered under administrative notice.  While not taken for administrative\nnotice, it is noted that travelers abroad can be an important source of intelligence information.\nTr. 152-170.\n18\nTr. 95.\n19\n5\ndiscussed his job with them while in Iran or during telephone calls.   Prior to departing on the first\n16\ntrip back to Iran, Applicant informed his facilities security officer of his intentions and plans.  The\nfacilities security officer put him in contact with a counter intelligence agent from the FBI.  The \nagent briefed Applicant on what to expect in Iran and what actions he should take.  Upon return from\nthe trip, Applicant was debriefed by the agent.17\nApplicant\u2019s wife testified that she was born in Tehran in 1970 and has a master\u2019s degree in\nclinical psychology from an Iranian university.  She did not work in her chosen field in Iran because\nshe refused to follow the Iranian dress code for women.  She has been in the United States since\n2001, and applied for United States citizenship and expects it to be granted soon.  They have a three\nyear old daughter born in the United States who is a United States citizen.  His wife\u2019s mother died\nover 20 year ago.  Her father is 74 years old and a retired rug merchant who lives in Iran.  Her\nbrother is 42 years old and a cabinet maker who lives in Iran.  She also has an aunt and uncle in Iran\nwho are a retired orphanage worker and a teacher.  She has an aunt and uncle who are residents and\ncitizens of the United States for over 37 years.  She was not raised in a religious atmosphere and does\nnot follow Iranian religious rules or customs.  She talks to her father about every three months when\nhe calls her.  She may initiate about one or two call a year with him.  She does not talk often with\nher brother, probably once or twice a year for holidays.  They are not close.  She last talked to her\nfather about three months before the hearing.  She has no intention of returning to Iran, and intents\nto renounce her Iranian citizenship when she becomes a United States citizen.   Applicant only met\n18\nhis in-laws when he went to Iran in 2000 and 2001.  He does not talk to them when either they call\nor his wife calls them.19\nApplicant visited Cuba in 1999.  His cousin in Canada, whom he had never meet,  invited\nhim to visit him and go to Cuba over the Christmas holiday that year.  Their travels arrangements\nwere made by a Canadian travel agency.  Applicant only had to show his United States passport to\nenter Cuba. He stated he did not use his Iranian passport to enter Cuba.  He did not know at that time\nthat United States citizens could not visit Cuba.  Upon his return, he admitted to United States border\ncontrol agents that he visited Cuba and purchased Cuban cigars.  The cigars were confiscated and\nhe paid a fine.  He later was assessed a fine for visiting Cuba and spending money.  He has paid the\nfine.  He did not include this trip on his security clearance application.  He mistakenly believed that\n\nTr. 96-10; Applicant Exhibit B (Letter of fine paid in full, dated November 2, 2004).\n20\nTr. 20-28.\n21\nTr. 28-39.\n22\nTr. 49-60.\n23\nTr. 62-76.\n24\nSee, Court Exhibit I (Consular Information Sheet, Iran, dated January 8, 2007); and Court Exhibit II (Request\n25\nfor Administrative Notice, dated July 24, 2007, and attached documents).\n6\nsince he paid the fine it did not have to be included.  He readily told security agents of the trip.  \n20\nApplicant is considered security worthy at work.  A witness that has a security clearance for\nover 40 years testified that for the last year he has worked in an area very close to Applicant.  He sees\nApplicant at work on a daily basis but has no outside social contact with him.  He knows Applicant\nfollows all security requirements and does not consider Applicant a security risk.   Another co-\n21\nworker, who has held a security clearance for over 18 years, testified the he works closely with\nApplicant and sees him daily but has no social contact with him outside work.  Applicant does not\ntalk about his family members in Iran.  Applicant always follows security requirements and is not\nconsidered a security risk.   Another co-worker testified he is a systems engineer like Applicant and\n22\nhas held a clearance for over 15 years.  He sees Applicant on a daily basis but has no social contact\nwith him outside of work.  Applicant is security conscious and always follows security requirements\nand is not a security risk.   Another co-worker testified that he has held a security clearance for over\n23\n37 years.  He has known Applicant for over 20 years.  He and Applicant started working together in\nanother location doing classified government work.  After that plant closed, he and Applicant went\nto separate locations.  Recently, he and Applicant began again working together.  He knows\nApplicant does not follow strict Islamic religious requirements.  Applicant does not indicate any ties\nto Iran and rarely talks of his family in Iran.  He knows Applicant is security conscious and follows\nall security requirements and believes he is not a security risk.24\nIran is a country that has been hostile to the United States since the 1979 revolution that\noverthrew the former pro-western government.  Iran\u2019s support for terrorists groups has long\nconcerned the United States.  Iran\u2019s human rights practices are also a concern for the United States.\nThe Iranian theocratic government has repressed its people, pursued weapons of mass destruction,\ninitiated a nuclear program that may include nuclear weapons, and continues to support terrorism\nin Iraq and around the world.  Iran is known to conduct intelligence operations and economic\nespionage against the United States.  The United States Department of State warns United States\ncitizens, particularly United States citizens of Iranian origin, to consider carefully the risks of travel\nto Iran.  The continued support for terrorism and human rights violations contributed to President\nBush\u2019s strong criticism of Iran in his 2002 State of the Union message and his designation of Iran\nas one of the \u201cAxis of Evil.\u201d  Iran is a nation whose interests are inimical to the United States.\nIt should be noted that United States citizens are prohibited from traveling to Cuba without\nspecific permission from the State Department.  \n25\n\nDepartment of the Navy v.

Each clearance decision must be fair,\nimpartial, and a commonsense decision based on the relevant and material facts and circumstances,\nthe whole person concept.\nThe adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make\nan affirmative determination that the person is eligible for a security clearance.  An administrative\njudge must apply the \u201cwhole person concept,\u201d and consider and carefully weigh the available, reliable\ninformation about the person.  An administrative judge should consider: (1) the nature, extent, and\nseriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at\nthe time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence\nof rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the\npotential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation of\nrecurrence.28\nA person granted access to classified information enters into a special relationship with the\ngovernment.  The government must be able to repose a high degree of trust and confidence in those\nindividuals to whom it grants access to classified information.  The decision to deny an individual a\nsecurity clearance is not necessarily a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant.   It is merely\n29\nan indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of\nDefense have established for issuing a clearance.\nInitially, the Government must present evidence to establish controverted facts in the SOR that\ndisqualify or may disqualify the Applicant from being eligible for access to classified information.30\nThereafter, Applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate\n\nISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd.

Since\n37\nApplicant submitted his security clearance application in 2004, his mother has passed away.  Therefore, his mother is\nno longer a security concern as alleged in allegation 2.b.  Applicant noted he has an uncle that is a citizen and resident\nof Iran.  The uncle was not alleged as a security concern.  If he had been, Applicant has mitigated any security concern\nbecause he has had only very limited contact with the uncle in over 30 years.  The nature of the relationship will not place\nApplicant in a position to chose between the interest of the uncle and the United States.\n8\nfacts.   Applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the\n31\nnational interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d   The government is under no duty to\n32\npresent evidence to disprove any Adjudicative Guideline mitigating condition, and an Administrative\nJudge cannot assume or infer that any particular mitigating condition is applicable merely because the\ngovernment does not present evidence to disprove that particular mitigating condition.   \u201c[T]he\n33\nDirective presumes there is a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the\ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability.\u201d   \u201cAny doubt as to whether access to\n34\nclassified information is clearly consistent with national security will be resolved in favor of the\nnational security.\u201d 35\nCONCLUSIONS\nI carefully considered all of the factors in evidence and the legal standards discussed above.\nI reach the following conclusions regarding the allegations in the SOR.\nUnder Guideline B, foreign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual\nhas divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or induced to help a foreign\nperson, group, organization, or government in a way that is not in the United States interest, or is\nvulnerable to pressure or coercion by any foreign interest.  Adjudication under this Guideline can and\nshould consider the identity of the foreign county in which the foreign contact or financial interest is\nlocated, including, but not limited to, such considerations as whether the foreign country is known to\ntarget United States citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associate with a risk of\nterrorism.36\nApplicant admits his father, three sisters, father-in-law, and brother-in-law are citizens and\nresidents of Iran.   His wife is a citizen of Iran, but resides with him in the United States.  Applicant\n37\nin the past has sent his family money each year, and visited Iran in 2000 and 2001.  Appellant\u2019s\nrelatives who are citizens and residents of Iran, his visits to see them, and sending them money raises\nForeign Influence Disqualifying Condition (FI DC) \u00b6 7(a) (Contact with a foreign family member,\n\n9\nbusiness or professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a foreign\ncountry if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation,\npressure, or coercion).  Each individual contact or activity by itself may not create a heightened risk\nof foreign influence, but the totality of the contacts and activity does indicate there may be a\nheightened risk of foreign influence.\nIn determining if Applicant\u2019s family and friend in Iran cause security concerns, I considered\nthat Iran is a country whose interests are inimical to the United States.  I considered that Iran has a poor\nrecord on human rights and its people do not enjoy basic freedoms.  I considered that Iran does engage\nin economic and other types of espionage, and the Iranian government is willing to use its citizens to\ntarget individuals in the United States for intelligence purposes.  It is reasonable to considered that Iran\nwould take any action it thinks appropriate to coerce its citizens with relatives in the United States to\npressure their United States relatives to provide information against the interest of the United States.\nWhile none of the considerations by themselves dispose of the issue, they are all factors to be\nconsidered in determining Applicant\u2019s vulnerability to pressure or coercion from his family members\nin Iran.\nApplicant and his wife share living quarters, his wife resides in the United States, and has\napplied for United States citizenship.  Since she lives in the United States, she does not by herself\ncreate a security concern for Applicant.  The security concern raised by Applicant\u2019s wife\u2019s family are\na direct security concern for Applicant.  FI DC \u00b6 7(d) (Sharing living quarters with a person or persons,\nregardless of citizenship status, if that relationship creates a heightened risk of foreign inducement,\nmanipulation, pressure, or coercion) need not be considered under the circumstances as a separate\ndisqualifying condition merely because Applicant shares living quarters with his wife.\nApplicant raised Foreign Influence Mitigating Condition (FI MC) \u00b6 8(c) (Contacts and\ncommunication with foreign citizens is so casual and infrequent that there is little likelihood that it\ncould create a risk for foreign influence or exploitation).  Applicant talks to his father and sisters only\na few times a years, and they usually initiate the calls.  He does not initiate calls except for holidays.\nHowever, the calls are to or from family members.  No matter how much Applicant feels the calls are\nunpleasant and that he may not want to talk to them, they still talk to each other since they are family\nmembers. The discussions and contacts are infrequent but they are not casual.  He has only seen his\nfather-in-law and brother-in-law a few times in 2000 and 2001, and does not talk to them.  His contact\nwith them is infrequent and casual.  This mitigating condition provides security concern mitigation for\nthe contacts with his in-laws but not with his immediate family.\nApplicant has raised Foreign Influence Mitigating Conditions (FI MC) \u00b6 8(a) (The nature of\nthe relationship with foreign persons, the country in which these persons are located, or the positions\nor activities of those persons in that country are such that is unlikely the individual will be placed in\na position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, group, organization, or\ngovernment and the interest of the United States).  Applicant\u2019s father is a retired tailor.  His sisters\nwork in private businesses as a beauty shop owner, secretary, and teacher.  His father-in-law and\nbrother-in-law also work in private industry.  His father-in-law is a retired carpet merchant and his\nbrother-in-law is a cabinet maker.  Since his mother passed away, he no longer sends his family\nmoney.  Applicant\u2019s information concerning his family members\u2019 living conditions, life style, and\nprofessions, and his limited contact with them show it is unlikely Applicant will be placed in a position\nto choose between the interests of his family and the interests of the United States.  Applicant has met\n\nAG \u00b6 9.\n38\n10\nhis burden to establish that his family in Iran do not present a heightened risk of foreign exploitation,\ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion.  They are ordinary citizens leading normal lives\nwhich also does not indicating a heightened risk for exploitation, pressure, or coercion.  FI MC \u00b6 8(a)\napplies.\nApplicant raised FI MC \u00b6 8(b) (There is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s\nsense of loyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country is minimal, or the\nindividual has such deep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the\nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the United States interest.) \nApplicant left Iran while it was under the control of the Shah government.  The new government took\nover and he lost support for his schooling.  He knows the present government is so repressive that he\ndid not contact his family for years.  He did not return to Iran for over 24 years.  When he returned it\nwas not out of a sense of obligation or loyalty to Iran.  His lack of obligation and loyalty to Iran was\nstrong enough that it kept him from returning to attend his mother\u2019s funeral.  He did not return because\nhe did not want to lose his life style in the United States.  He only returned three times to meet and\nmarry an Iranian women, his present wife.  Their meetings were minimal before they married.  He has\nbeen in the United States for over 31 years, the overwhelming majority of his adult life.  His sense of\nloyalty is to the United States and the life he has established for himself.  He took the additional step\nof sending a request to Iran to renounce any claim to Iranian citizenship.  He no longer can return\nsafely to Iran.  FI MC \u00b6 8(b) applies.\nWhen an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a foreign country over\nthe United States, then he may be prone to provide information or make decisions that are harmful to\nthe interests of the United States.   Applicant applied for an Iranian passport after obtaining United\n38\nStates citizenship.  He possessed and used that passport to enter Iran in 2000 and 2001.  He has\nestablished that he did not use his Iranian passport to enter Cuba in 1999.  His Iranian passport raises\nForeign Preference Disqualifying Condition (FP DC) AG \u00b6 10(a) (Exercise of any right, privilege, or\nobligation of foreign citizenship after becoming a United States citizen or through the foreign\ncitizenship of a family member.  This includes but is not limited to: (1) possession of a current foreign\npassport.)  He mitigated the security concerns for foreign preference under Foreign Preference\nMitigating Conditions (FP MC) \u00b6 11(b) (The individual has expressed a willingness to renounce dual\ncitizenship), and FP MC \u00b6 11(e) (The passport has been destroyed, surrendered to the cognizant\nsecurity authority, or otherwise invalidated.)  The Iranian passport is no longer current having expired\nin March 2007, and it has been destroyed.  Applicant showed more than a willingness to renounce his\nIranian citizenship.  He took the necessary step to renounce his Iranian citizenship by sending a letter\nto the Iranian interest section of the Pakistan Embassy.  Applicant has mitigated security concerns for\nforeign preference.\nI carefully considered all of the circumstances discussed above in regard to disqualifying and\nmitigating conditions as well as the following factors in light of the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept.  The\n\u201cwhole person\u201d concept requires consideration of all available information about Applicant, not a\nsingle item in isolation, to reach a common sense determination concerning Applicant\u2019s security\nworthiness.  Applicant\u2019s father and sisters are citizens and residents of Iran.  This simple fact alone\nmight be sufficient to raise security concerns over Applicant\u2019s vulnerability to coercion, exploitation,\nor pressure.  However, mere family ties with people in a foreign country is not, as a matter of law,\n\nAG \u00b6 2 (8).\n39\nAG \u00b6 2 (4).\n40\nAG \u00b6 2 (7).\n41\n11\ndisqualifying under Guideline B.  Whether an applicant\u2019s family ties in a foreign country poses a\nsecurity risk depends on a common sense evaluation of the overall facts and circumstances of the\nfamily ties.  Applicant\u2019s family in Iran, both individually and collectively, are in positions and\ncircumstances that make it unlikely Applicant will be placed in a position to choose between the\ninterests of his family and the interest of the United States, or that he can be exploited, pressured, or\ncoerced because of them.   Applicant has been in the United States almost his entire adult life, and\n39\na citizen of the United States for over 21 years.   His wife and daughter are with him in the United\n40\nStates and his wife has applied to be a United States citizen.  His financial assets are in the United\nStates, with none in Iran.  His co-worker and his supervisor consider him to be security conscious and\nnot a security risk.  He has successfully held a security clearance for almost 20 years.  He does not\ndiscuss his work with his family or in-laws in Iran.  \nApplicant\u2019s life story is an example of the success of many immigrants to the United States.\nHe came to the United States early in his life to better himself through education, and became a United\nStates citizen.  His wife came to the United States for the same reason and hopes to be a successful\nprofessional.  Their daughter was born in the United States.  The family enjoys a typical United States\nlife style with no vestiges of Iranian or Islamic  culture.  His limited visits to Iran were for personal\nreasons rather than any connection to the Iran government.   He has established that his motivation\n41\nfor his contacts and activities with his family in Iran do not indicate a security risk.  He has renounced\nhis Iranian citizenship and destroyed his Iranian passport.  He has presented sufficient information to\nmitigate any security concerns under the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept.  I conclude Applicant is eligible for\naccess to classified information.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required\nby section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline C:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline B:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\n\n12\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g:\nFor Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly consistent\nwith the national security to grant a security clearance for Applicant.

She gave false answers in response\nto two questions about her financial delinquencies on a security-clearance application.  She did not\n\n Executive Order 10865, dated February 20, 1960, as amended, and DoD Directive 5220.6, dated January 2,\n1\n1992, as amended (Directive).\n See Memorandum from the Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence, dated August 30, 2006, Subject:\n2\nImplementation of Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information (December\n29, 2005). \n2\npresent sufficient evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the security concerns. Eligibility\nfor a security clearance is denied.\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nApplicant contests the Defense Department\u2019s intent to deny or revoke eligibility for a security\nclearance. Acting under the relevant authority,  the agency issued a statement of reasons (SOR) to\n1\nApplicant on March 16, 2007. The SOR\u2014which is equivalent to an administrative\ncomplaint\u2014details the factual basis for the action and alleges security concerns under Guideline F\nfor financial considerations based on multiple delinquent debts, and under Guideline E for personal\nconduct based on falsification of a security-clearance application. \nIn addition to the Directive, this case is brought under the revised Adjudicative Guidelines\nfor Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information (Revised Guidelines) approved by\nthe President on December 29, 2005. The Revised Guidelines were then modified by the Defense\nDepartment, effective September 1, 2006. They supersede or replace the guidelines published in\nEnclosure 2 to the Directive. They apply to all adjudications and other determinations where an SOR\nhas been issued on September 1, 2006, or thereafter.  The Directive is pending formal amendment.\n2\nThe Revised Guidelines apply to this case because the SOR is dated March 20, 2007, which is after\nthe effective date.  \nApplicant replied to the SOR in an undated submission. She elected to have her case decided\non the written record in lieu of a hearing. Applicant admits all the allegations under Guideline F.\nAlso, she admits the falsification allegations under Guideline E. She did not provide a further\nexplanation to the SOR allegations. \nOn June 21, 2007, the government submitted its written case consisting of all relevant and\nmaterial information that could be adduced at a hearing. This so-called file of relevant material\n(FORM) was mailed to Applicant and it was received by her on June 27, 2007. Applicant timely\nreplied to the FORM by providing proof of payment for two accounts. Department counsel reviewed\nthose documents and had no objections to their consideration. The documents are marked and\nadmitted as Exhibits A and B. The case was assigned for decision on July 26, 2007. \nIn general terms, there are two  major issues: Is it clearly consistent with the national interest\nto grant or continue eligibility for a security clearance for Applicant in light of (1) her history of\n\n3\nrepeated financial problems, and (2) her false answers in response to two questions on a security-\nclearance application? Both issues are decided against Applicant. \nFINDINGS OF FACT\nBased on the record evidence as a whole, the following facts are established. \n1.\nApplicant is a 35-year-old employee of a company engaged in federal contracting. She has\nworked for a federal contractor since about January 2005. She has worked for her current employer\nsince about October 2006. \n2.\nIn October 2006, Applicant completed a security-clearance application. When signing it, she\ncertified that her statements were true, complete, and correct to the best of her knowledge and belief\nand were made in good faith. Also, she acknowledged that a knowing and willful false statement on\nthe application could be punished by a fine or imprisonment or both. Question 28 on the application\nasked Applicant to disclose financial delinquencies. In response to Question 28a, she denied, in the\nlast seven years, being more than 180 days delinquent on any debts. In response to Question 28b, she\ndenied that she was currently more than 90 days delinquent on any debts. In her written response to\nthe SOR, Applicant admits giving false answers in response to these two questions. \n3.\nApplicant has a history of repeated indebtedness over many years. For example, in 1997, she\nobtained a Chapter 7 bankruptcy discharge for about $5,536 in debt. A credit report from October\n2006 reveals derogatory information about her financial condition. The public record section of the\nreport reveals the bankruptcy case as well as a civil judgment she had satisfied. The report also\nreveals 47 accounts in the collections section. Another credit report from March 2007 further\nconfirms Applicant\u2019s financial history. \n4.\nThe SOR alleges that Applicant has 18 unpaid debts ranging from $13 to $13,777 for a total\nof about $18,000. Several of the unpaid debts are based on bad checks. In addition, it alleges\nApplicant obtained the Chapter 7 bankruptcy discharge as described above. In her written response\nto the SOR, Applicant admits these matters. In addition to her admissions, the credit reports from\nOctober 2006 and March 2007 further establish these matters. \n5.\nExhibit A is proof of payment for the unpaid $56 debt in SOR subparagraph 1.f. Exhibit B\nis proof of payment for an unnamed debt. It appears to be a one-page fax from a collection agency.\nIt indicates a certain case number was paid in full for a total amount of $2,299.55. It cannot be\ndetermined if this debt is one of the debts in the SOR. \n6.\nOther than Exhibits A and B, Applicant did not produce proof of payment or other\ndocumentary evidence about the debts in question. She did not produce documentary evidence about\nher overall financial situation. And she did not address her  false answers to Question 28a and 28b.\n\n Department of Navy v.

Dec. 19, 2002) (citations omitted).\n12\n4\nGENERAL PRINCIPLES OF LAW AND POLICIES\nNo one has a right to a security clearance.  As noted by the Supreme Court in Department\n3\nof Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe clearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations\nshould err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d  A favorable decision establishes eligibility of an\n4\napplicant to be granted a security clearance for access to confidential, secret, or top-secret\ninformation.  An unfavorable decision: (1) denies any application; (2)  revokes any existing security\n5\nclearance; and (3) prevents access to classified information at any level and retention of any existing\nsecurity clearance.   Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive, any doubt about\n6\nwhether an applicant should be allowed access to classified information will be resolved in favor of\nprotecting national security.\nThere is no presumption in favor of granting or continuing eligibility for access to classified\ninformation.  The government has the burden of presenting evidence to establish facts alleged in the\n7\nSOR that have been controverted.  An applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to refute,\n8\nexplain, extenuate, or mitigate facts that have been admitted or proven.  In addition, an applicant has\n9\nthe ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.  In Egan, the Supreme\n10\nCourt said that the burden of proof in a security clearance case is less than the preponderance of the\nevidence.  The agency appellate authority has followed the Court\u2019s reasoning, and a judge\u2019s findings\n11\nof fact are reviewed under the substantial-evidence standard.12\nThe Revised Guidelines sets forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when evaluating a\nperson\u2019s security clearance eligibility, including disqualifying conditions (DC) and mitigating\n\n Executive Order 10865, \u00a7 7.\n13\n Revised Guidelines at 13\u201314 (setting forth the disqualifying and mitigating conditions). \n14\n DC 1 is \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts.\u201d \n15\n DC 3 is \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d \n16\n5\nconditions (MC) for each guideline. In addition, each clearance decision must be a fair and impartial\ncommonsense decision based upon consideration of all the relevant and material information, the\npertinent criteria and adjudication factors, and the whole-person concept. A person granted access\nto classified information enters into a special relationship with the government. The government\nmust be able to have a high degree of trust and confidence in those persons to whom it grants access\nto classified information. The decision to deny a person a security clearance is not a determination\nof an applicant\u2019s loyalty.  Instead, it is a determination that the applicant has not met the strict\n13\nguidelines the President has established for granting eligibility for a security clearance.\nCONCLUSIONS\nUnder Guideline F for financial considerations,  a security concern typically exists due to\n14\nsignificant unpaid debts. Failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by\nrules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability,\ntrustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information. An individual who is financially\noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal or unethical acts to generate funds to meet\nfinancial obligations. Similarly, an individual who is financially irresponsible may also be\nirresponsible, unconcerned, negligent, or careless in properly handling and safeguarding classified\ninformation.   \nThe government contends Applicant\u2019s history of financial problems is a security concern.\nApplicant did not make specific contentions. The question is whether Applicant\u2019s history of repeated\nfinancial problems is consistent with eligibility for access to classified information under the clearly-\nconsistent standard. \nThe record evidence supports a conclusion that Applicant has a history of repeated financial\nproblems over many years. The 1997 Chapter 7 bankruptcy case and the more recent adverse\nfinancial information are proof of this conclusion. Her history of repeated financial problems is a\nsecurity concern because it indicates inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts  and a history of not\n15\nmeeting financial obligations  within the meaning of Guideline F. The record evidence is more than\n16\nsufficient to establish these two disqualifying conditions. \nAll of the mitigating conditions under Guideline F have been considered and none apply in\nApplicant\u2019s favor. She did not present sufficient evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate\nthe security concern. In particular, the record evidence is insufficient to establish that she made a\ngood-faith effort to pay or otherwise resolve her indebtedness. The minimal documentation, Exhibits\nA and B, is not enough to show a serious, good-faith effort. Applicant\u2019s history of repeated financial\nproblems outweighs the favorable evidence. \n\n Revised Guidelines at 10\u201312 (setting forth the disqualifying and mitigating conditions).  \n17\n Deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any personnel security questionnaire,\n18\npersonal history statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award\nbenefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \n6\nUnder Guideline E for personal conduct,  a security concern may arise due to conduct\n17\ninvolving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules\nand regulations, which may raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and\nability to protect classified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful and\ncandid answers during the security clearance process or any other failure to cooperate with the\nsecurity clearance process.\nThe government contends that Applicant\u2019s false answers raise a security concern. Applicant\ndid not make specific contentions. The question is whether Applicant\u2019s false answers in response\nto two questions about her financial delinquencies on a security-clearance application are consistent\nwith eligibility for access to classified information under the clearly-consistent standard. \nThe government established its case under this guideline. Applicant admits giving false\nanswers in response to Questions 28a and 28b of her security-clearance application. The record\nevidence is sufficient to conclude that DC 1 of the guideline applies against Applicant.  Making\n18\ndeliberately false statements to the government during the security-clearance process is serious\nmisconduct.  \nAll of the mitigating conditions under Guideline E have been considered and none apply in\nApplicant\u2019s favor. She did not offer an explanation for her false answers. And she did not offer\nevidence that might otherwise explain, extenuate, or mitigate the security concern. \nViewing the record evidence as a whole, Applicant did not present sufficient evidence to\nrebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the cumulative effect of her history of financial problems and\nfalse statements. Applicant did not meet her ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable\nclearance decision. In reaching this conclusion, the whole-person concept was given due\nconsideration and that analysis does not support a favorable decision for Applicant.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nSOR \u00b6 1\u2013Guideline F:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraphs a\u2013r:\nAgainst Applicant\nSOR \u00b6 2\u2013Guideline E:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph a:\nAgainst Applicant\n\n7\nDECISION\nIn light of all the facts and circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the national interest\nto grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.

MATCHINSKI\nAPPEARANCES\nFOR GOVERNMENT\nFahryn Hoffman, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro se\nSYNOPSIS\nApplicant owes more than $60,000 in delinquent debt (including $15,297 in defaulted student\nloans) incurred due to irresponsible spending, difficulty finding suitable employment after he earned\nhis degree, and his spouse\u2019s inability to work at times in the past two years due to medical problems.\nRecent efforts to resolve the debt are not sufficient to overcome the doubts about his judgment.\nClearance is denied.\n\nApplicant mistakenly forwarded documents to the hearing location on November 13, 2007. Applicant\n1\nresubmitted documents which were received by me on November  27, 2007. The original submission was retrieved from\nthe U.S. Tax Court on December 11, 2007. In that package was a wage statement for Applicant for the week ending\nNovember 2, 2007, which was not among the documents received on November 27, 2007. Department Counsel did not\nobject to the admission of any of the documents and they were admitted into evidence. \n2\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant or continue a\nsecurity clearance for Applicant. As required by \u00b6 E3.1.2 of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6\n(Jan. 2, 1992), as amended, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) on June 15, 2007, detailing\nthe basis for its decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline F (financial considerations) of the\nrevised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) issued on December 29, 2005, and implemented by the\nDepartment of Defense effective September 1, 2006. The guidelines were provided to Applicant\nwhen the SOR was issued. Applicant submitted an undated Answer to the SOR and elected to have\na hearing before an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on September 6, 2007.\nI convened a hearing on October 17, 2007, to consider whether it is clearly consistent with\nthe national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. Four government exhibits\n(Ex. 1-4) and three Applicant exhibits (Ex. A-C) were admitted, and testimony was taken from\nApplicant and his spouse. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on October 25, 2007.\nThe record was initially held open until November 14, 2007, for Applicant to submit\nadditional financial records. Applicant forwarded earnings statements for himself and his spouse,\nand a letter from their childcare provider. Department Counsel did not object to their admission, and\nthe documents were entered into evidence as Exhibits D\u2013I.1\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nDOHA alleged under Guideline F, financial considerations, that Applicant owes about\n$77,584 in delinquent debt (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a\u20131.q). Applicant admits that he and his spouse wrote a bad\ncheck to the postal service (\u00b6 1.a); he cosigned on a loan for his spouse's car that was repossessed\nafter he got laid off and his spouse became ill (\u00b6 1.c); he had incurred delinquent credit card debt (\u00b6\u00b6\n1.d 1.l, 1.m, 1.n, 1.o) more than seven years ago;  and he had taken out four student loans for college\n(\u00b6\u00b6 1.g, 1.h, 1.i., 1.j) that he was repaying at $500 monthly. Applicant denied the debts alleged in\nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.e, 1.f, 1.k, 1.p, and 1.q. Applicant's admissions are incorporated as findings of fact.\nAfter a thorough consideration of the pleadings, exhibits, and hearing transcript, I make the\nfollowing additional findings of fact.\nApplicant is a 36-year-old senior test engineer who has worked for a defense contractor since\nApril 2005. He seeks a security clearance for his present duties involving test programs for a missile\ndefense system.\nFrom August 1989 to October 1993, Applicant pursued undergraduate study in electrical\nengineering at a private university. He took on education loans of $2,625 in August 1989, $2,625\nin October 1990, $1,483 in September 1991, and $2,000 in August 1992. At the end of his freshman\n\n3\nyear, he began to rely on consumer credit. He viewed credit as available cash and spent without\nregard to what he could afford. Applicant estimates he owed between $15,000 and $20,000 in\nconsumer credit card debt when he graduated, which includes about $1,000 for part of his tuition\ncosts senior year. In retrospect, Applicant realizes he was too immature to have a credit card.\nAfter he earned his bachelor of science degree, Applicant was unable to find work\ncommensurate with his education for more than a year. Applicant worked full-time in maintenance\nfor a warehouse retailer at $8.00 an hour for a couple of weeks. He did not like the work, and in\nDecember 1993, he started full-time as a cashier in a liquor store making $6.00 an hour. He took on\nnew credit to pay other credit obligations (\u201cthe whole situation snowballed from there.\u201d Tr. 47). For\nabout six weeks, from February 1994 to April 1994, Applicant began seasonal employment as a data\ntranscriber for the Internal Revenue Service at $8.50 per hour in addition to his hours at the liquor\nstore. He worked at the liquor store until August 1994, when he was placed by a temporary agency\nat a high-end electronics corporation earning $8.00 an hour initially and then $15.00 an hour. Social\nsecurity earnings for 1994 totaled $12,592.\nIn July 1995, he became a direct hire of the company as a test engineer II at about $36,138\nannually. With promotions, his salary increased to approximately $57,000 by the time he left the\ncompany in September 2000. He was able to start making payments on his student loans and on\nsome credit cards, but he continued to incur new credit debt.\nIn November 1996, Applicant got married. They had a daughter in January 1999 and a son\nin October 1999. Applicant underestimated the costs of raising a child, and the amount of his\nrevolving debt increased (\u201cthat sent us over the edge again into just revolving debt and it just kept\ngetting worse and worse.\u201d Tr. 30).\nIn September 2000, Applicant started a new job as a senior test engineer with a safety\nproducts company located closer to his home. His starting annual salary was about $68,000. He\nbegan to receive monthly bills for his student loan. About six months later, the monthly bills stopped,\nso Applicant assumed that a request to defer repayment had been granted. In about 2002/03, he\nreceived a bill for his student loan that he could not repay so he did nothing. His wages amounted\nto $68,192 in 2002.\nIn January 2003,  Applicant and his spouse had another daughter. Despite the additional\nfinancial stress on the home, Applicant and his spouse put their older daughter in private school at\na cost of $300 per month starting in September 2003.  He earned $75,131 in 2003 and $71,489 in\n2004. \nApplicant\u2019s spouse went from a full-time job to a temporary job in about 2004 because she\nwas not feeling well. Her wages for the year totaled $11,634.49. In April 2005, Applicant left his job\nas he was about to be laid off, and he began his current employment as an electrical engineer with\nthe defense contractor. His annual pay for 2005 was $78,326. Applicant made little, if any, progress\nin resolving his outstanding debt due to the decline in his spouse\u2019s income. For about a year from\nJuly 2005, she was hospitalized at least three times and had about 21 emergency room visits. While\nshe was covered under his health insurance, they had co-pay expenses, and she was unable to work\nfrom July to September or October 2005. She went to work part-time only to be hospitalized again\na couple of months later. Out of work for another month, she worked over the next year whenever\n\n4\nshe was physically able. Her annual wage earnings were $7,873.19 for 2005 and only $4,791.90 for\n2006.\nOn April 14, 2006, Applicant executed a Questionnaire for Sensitive Positions (SF 86) in\napplication for a clearance.  He responded affirmatively to financial delinquencies over 180 days in\nthe last seven years, and any debts over 90 days delinquent currently. Applicant listed unresolved\ndelinquent credit card debt totaling $49,387.83 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d, 1.m, 1.n, 1.o) and student loan debt of\n$16,961.98 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.g, 1.h, 1.i, 1.j).\nIn or before May 2006, Applicant and his spouse received notice that her car (SOR \u00b6 1.c, \u00b6\n1.f same debt) was going to be repossessed. His spouse, who handled the bills, promised to take care\nof it. She became ill and \u201cit fell through the cracks.\u201d (Tr. 41) Applicant woke up one day to find the\nvehicle gone. About six months later, he received notice that the debt was going to judgment.\nApplicant arranged to make payments but missed a payment when his spouse experienced new\nmedical problems. In spring 2007, Applicant contacted the law firm collecting the debt and entered\ninto an agreement to repay the debt at $150 per month.\nIn September 2006, Applicant and his spouse transferred their older daughter and enrolled\ntheir son in a less expensive parochial school. They stayed only one month when Applicant and his\nspouse switched them to public school as they realized they could not afford the tuition.\nBeginning in late September 2006, Applicant\u2019s wages were attached at the rate of 15% of his\nsalary to repay his student loan debts (\u00b6\u00b6 1.g, 1.h, 1.i, 1.j). With about $700 per month less in take-\nhome pay, Applicant fell behind in his monthly expenses. Applicant arranged to make payments of\n$500 per month, but the payments were not made as his spouse underwent gastric bypass surgery in\nApril 2007, and was hospitalized following complications in August 2007. The wage garnishment\nwas reinstated in September 2007, but the assignee agreed to accept $400 per month to rehabilitate\nthe loans on proof of his spouse\u2019s illness. Applicant and his spouse made their first payment under\nthe new agreement in late September 2007.\nA history of Applicant\u2019s delinquent accounts is reflected in the following table.\nDebt as alleged in SOR\nDelinquency history\nPayment status\n\u00b6 1.a $54 debt in collection\nJan 07\nAttributed to spouse writing\nbad check for postal services,\nplaced for collection Jan 07\nIn Jun 07 promised to satisfy\nby Sep 07; paid $54.31Sep\n11, 07 (Ex.

His spouse\nreturned to work full-time (32 hours as a receptionist in a medical office and 12-16 as a telephone\nanswering service operator on the weekends) on September 24, 2007. She began paying $200 weekly\nfor childcare.\nApplicant\u2019s take-home pay is about $4,300 monthly. His spouse\u2019s take-home pay now\naverages $1,400 monthly, up from $400 monthly. Applicant has a savings account, but he closed his\nchecking account because it kept getting overdrawn. Applicant pays his bills by money order with\nfunds out of his savings account, which had a balance of about $5.00 as of his hearing. The monies\nearned by his spouse since she returned to work full-time went to catch up on obligations that had\nbecome delinquent. Applicant has no retirement assets. Retirement savings from his previous job\nwent to pay bills.\nApplicant and his spouse and children live with his father. Applicant pays rent of $500 a\nmonth plus all the utility costs, which average about $600 a month. They are still paying on last\nyear\u2019s gas heating and electric utility costs that for two months in the winter exceeded $1,100 a\nmonth. Applicant owns a 1989 model-year automobile that cost him $1,000 in December 2005. In\nthe last month, since his spouse began working full-time, they began renting a car at $200 per month\nfrom his father. Applicant estimates his monthly expenses to be about $3,430 per month not counting\nthe promised payments on his student loan and car debts. This figure includes $254 per month in\ncable, phone, and internet services. Before her recent return to work full-time, they had about $220\nper month remaining after payment of household expenses.\n\n7\nApplicant has no active credit card accounts with the exception of a corporate credit card that\nhe uses to travel for work. His spouse has one credit card with a balance owed of $300 as of October\n2007. They have new medical debts totaling almost $1,000. They have received some informal\nfinancial advice but no in-depth counseling concerning the best way to deal with their delinquent\ndebt.\nPOLICIES\n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S.\n518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has \u201cthe authority to . . . control access to\ninformation bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is sufficiently\ntrustworthy to occupy a position . . . that will give that person access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527.\nThe President authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants eligibility for\naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb.\n20, 1960). An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with\nthe national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App.\nBd. Dec. 19, 2002).\nThe revised Adjudicative Guidelines set forth potentially disqualifying conditions (DC) and\nmitigating conditions (MC) under each guideline. In evaluating the security worthiness of an\napplicant, the administrative judge must also assess the adjudicative process factors listed in \u00b6 6.3\nof the Directive. The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a\ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant. See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. It is merely an indication\nthe applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have\nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nCONCLUSIONS\nGuideline F\u2014Financial Considerations\nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial obligations\nmay indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations,\nall of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information. An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage\nin illegal acts to generate funds. (AG \u00b6 18). While his use of credit to pay for tuition can be excused\nas a justifiable expense likely to pay future dividends, he spent irresponsibly in college. Applicant\ntestified he was between $15,000 and $20,000 in debt when he graduated. The record shows that\nApplicant continued to abuse credit after college, as most of the delinquent accounts alleged were\nopened after he earned his degree. Applicant testified that it was the birth of his first two children\nthat sent them over the edge financially.  With interest continuing to accrue, and little if any\npayments, his total credit card debt had burgeoned to about $45,000 by 2007. He also defaulted on\nhis student loan obligations, which totaled $16,314 as of April 2007. Guideline F disqualifying\nconditions \u00b6 19(a) (inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts) and \u00b6 19(c) (a history of not meeting\nfinancial obligations) apply. \n\n8\nApplicant is in a difficult financial situation at present in part because of factors outside of\nhis control. Already saddled with debt when he graduated, Applicant did not find permanent, full-\ntime employment commensurate with his qualifications until July 1995. Paid from $6 to $8.50 per\nhour from his jobs during that year and a half, Applicant opened new credit card accounts, most\nnotably \u00b6 1.m, just to meet his expenses. More recently, his ability to repay his debts was\ncompromised by his spouse\u2019s inability to work because of illness. His spouse went from a full-time\njob to a temporary job in about 2004 because she was not feeling well. In about June 2005, she\nstarted having serious medical issues that eventually led to her repeated hospitalization and to several\nemergency room visits. She was unemployed until October 2005 and went back to work only part-\ntime until September 24, 2007. During part of that time, 15% of Applicant\u2019s wages were being taken\ntoward repaying his student loan debt.  Underemployment and unexpected medical emergency are\nfactors that implicate mitigating condition \u00b6 20(b) (the conditions that resulted in the financial\nproblem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn,\nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual acted\nresponsibly under the circumstances), but Applicant has a mixed record of late with respect to\nresponsible handling of his financial matters.\nIn September 2000, Applicant\u2019s annual salary went from $52,000 to $68,000. He earned\n$75,131 in 2003 and $71,489 in 2004. He chose to ignore his delinquent obligations  for years while\nat the same time he enrolled his daughter in private school. He allowed his spouse\u2019s car to be\nrepossessed in May 2006 despite an annual salary of about $73,273. That September, he enrolled his\nchildren in public school as he and his spouse realized they could not afford the tuition.  In about\nMarch 2007, he consolidated his telephone/internet/cable television service apparently to lower\ncosts. However, as of October 2007  he was paying for premium cable television channels when he\nhad only about $5 in financial deposits and was saving nothing for retirement. He had closed his\nchecking account due to fees associated with overdrafts. In summer 2007, he arranged to pay $150\nmonthly on his delinquent auto loan debt (SOR \u00b6 1.c) but did not make the payments. As a\nconsequence, his repayment obligation was raised to $200 monthly.\n In the month before his hearing, Applicant made one or two payments on his auto loan (SOR\n\u00b6 1.c), satisfied the bad check to the post office (SOR \u00b6 1.a) and made the first payment toward\nrehabilitating his student loans (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.g, 1.h, 1.i, 1.j) (see MC \u00b6 20(d) (the individual initiated\na good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts). Applicant was also not\nincurring any new credit card debt. With his spouse now working full-time, Applicant may well be\nin position to meaningfully address his outstanding debt. Yet, given the delinquent debt totals more\nthan $60,000, there is little guarantee that he will be able to get out of financial difficulty in the near\nfuture. Applicant indicated that he and his spouse were still living paycheck to paycheck, and they\nhad nothing in reserve for emergencies. Discretionary funds were going toward repaying a utility\ndebt incurred last winter.  Applicant has not received any formal budget or debt counseling that could\nhelp him deal with his extensive debt.\nUnder the \u201cwhole-person\u201d evaluation required by AG \u00b6 2(a) (The adjudicative process is an\nexamination of a sufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the\nperson is an acceptable security risk), Applicant\u2019s candor about his financial problems and about\nhis mismanagement of credit are factors in his favor. Applicant also shows some improvement in\nhis handling of his financial matters (see \u00b62(a)(6) (the presence or absence of rehabilitation and\nother permanent behavioral changes)) in that he pays his obligations by money order, does not rely\n\n9\non consumer credit, and is no longer incurring overdraft fees on a checking account. He has shown\nhimself to be a good provider for his family, but  sound financial judgment sometimes requires tough\ndecisions that Applicant has only recently been willing to make (e.g., private versus public school).\nHe remains under the burden of heavy debt and does not have a reasonable plan in place to cope with\nany unexpected costs should they occur (see \u00b6 2(a)(8) (the potential for pressure, coercion,\nexploitation, or duress)). Based on the evidence presented, I am unable to conclude at this time that\nit is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant access to classified information.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nParagraph 1.

Applicant\nrequested a hearing.  On February 14, 2008, after the hearing, Administrative Judge Claude R. Heiny\ndenied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant timely appealed pursuant to the\nDirective \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s adverse clearance\ndecision is arbitrary, capricious or contrary to law.\nApplicant argues that the Judge\u2019s adverse decision should be reversed because the Judge\nerred as to some of his findings and did not give sufficient weight to Applicant\u2019s mitigating evidence\nwhich he contends showed that he had acted responsibly in dealing with his financial situation.  As\npart of his argument, Applicant also contends that the Judge\u2019s findings could have given a fuller\nexplanation of his financial circumstances.  Applicant\u2019s arguments do not demonstrate that the Judge\nerred. \nThe Judge is presumed to have considered all the evidence in the record unless he specifically\nstates otherwise.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 04-08623 at 4 (App. Bd. Jul. 29, 2005).  He is not\nrequired to cite or discuss every piece of record evidence.  See, e.g, ISCR Case No. 04-01961 at 2\n(App. Bd. Jul. 12, 2007).  Some of the alleged errors are differences of interpretation or\ncharacterization.  The remaining ones are harmless in that they would not be likely to change the\noutcome of the case.  After reviewing the record, the Board concludes that the Judge\u2019s material\nfindings of security concern are supported by \u201csuch relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might\naccept as adequate to support such a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the record.\u201d\nDirective \u00b6  E3.1.32.1.  See also Consolo v. Federal Maritime Comm\u2019n, 383 U.S. 607, 620-21\n(1966).\n \nThe presence of some mitigating evidence does not alone compel the Judge to make a\nfavorable security clearance decision.  As the trier of fact, the Judge has to weigh the evidence as a\nwhole and decide whether the favorable evidence outweighs the unfavorable evidence, or vice versa.\nSee, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-10320 at 2 (App. Bd. Nov. 7, 2007).  An applicant\u2019s disagreement with\nthe Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, or an ability to argue for a different interpretation of the\nevidence, is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence or reached conclusions in\na manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-17409 at 3\n(App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2007).\nIn this case, the Judge found that Applicant had a lengthy history of not meeting financial\nobligations.  At the time of the hearing, Applicant had substantial delinquent debts that he was in the\nprocess of disputing or otherwise trying to resolve.  In light of the foregoing, the Judge could\nreasonably conclude that Applicant\u2019s financial problems were still ongoing.   See, e.g., ISCR Case\nNo. 05-07747 at 2 (App. Bd. Jul. 3, 2007).  The Judge weighed the mitigating evidence offered by\nApplicant against the length and seriousness of the disqualifying conduct and considered the possible\napplication of relevant conditions and factors.  He reasonably explained why the evidence which the\nApplicant had presented in mitigation was insufficient to overcome the government\u2019s security\nconcerns.  The Board does not review a case de novo.  The favorable record evidence cited by\n\n3\nApplicant is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge\u2019s decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary\nto law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-11172 at 2 (App. Bd. Sep. 4, 2007).  After reviewing the record,\nthe Board concludes that the Judge examined the relevant data and articulated a satisfactory\nexplanation for his decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the facts found and the choice\nmade.\u2019\u201d Motor Vehicle Mfrs.

He has sent his \ncreditors a single $100 post dated check. Based upon a review of the case file, \npleadings, exhibits, and testimony, the record evidence is insufficient to mitigate or \nextenuate the negative security concerns. Applicant has not successfully mitigated \nfinancial considerations concerns. Clearance is denied. \n \n \nApplicant contests the Defense Department\u2019s intent to deny or revoke his \neligibility for an industrial security clearance. Acting under the relevant Executive Order \nand DoD Directive,1 the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) on July 3, 2007, detailing the security concerns under \nGuideline F for financial considerations based on a history of financial problems as \nevicenced by delinquent debts. \n \n \n \n                                                          \n  \n \n1 Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance \nReview Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) \npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for \nSORs issued after September 1, 2006. \nFebruary 14, 2008\n\n \n \n \n \n \nOn August 28, 2007, DOHA received Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR that \nrequested a hearing before an Administrative Judge. On October 11, 2007, I was \nassigned the case. On October 17, 2007, DOHA issued a notice of hearing scheduling \nthe hearing held on November 14, 2007. The government offered Exhibits (Ex.) 1 \nthrough 4, which were admitted into evidence. Applicant testified on his own behalf and \nsubmitted Exhibits A and B, which were admitted into evidence.  \n \nThe record was kept open to allow Applicant to submit additional matters. \nAdditional documents were received on November 30, 2007. Department Counsel did \nnot object to the material and the items were admitted into evidence as Exs. C and D. \nOn November 26, 2007, DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) of the hearing. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, dated June 25, 2007, Applicant admitted the factual \nallegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, and 1.d of the SOR, with explanations. He denied the factual \nallegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.c and 1.e of the SOR. The admissions are incorporated herein as \nfindings of fact. After a thorough review of the record, case file, pleadings, exhibits, and \ntestimony, I make the following findings of fact. \n \n \nApplicant is a 35-year-old systems engineer who has worked for a defense \ncontractor since January 2003, and is seeking to maintain a security clearance.  \n \n \nIn July 1998, Applicant married. Within days of his marriage he purchased a time \nshare. (Tr. 42) A credit collection agency is attempting to collect the $9,396 foreclosure \ndebt (SOR \u00b6 1.d) now increased to $17,000 due to interest, late fees, charges, and \nattorney fees. In October 2007, Applicant sent the law firm that was attempting to collect \nthe debt a letter stating he did not owe the debt. (Ex. A) Applicant sent a second letter \n(Ex. B) stating he believed the debt was incurred due to \u201cgrossly false and extremely \nmisleading information\u201d from the seller. The law firm sent a letter stating $17,000 was \nowed and they were continuing with foreclosure. (Ex. D) The beginning loan balance \nwas $9,508. Monthly payments were $158.68. Payments were made between August \n1999 and March 2002 during which time $1,131 in principal had been paid.  \n \n \nIn March 2002, Applicant\u2019s first child was born and he realized he would no \nlonger be taking vacations or using the time share. He was told he could not use the \nproperty unless he was current on his payments. (Tr. 42) Applicant believed he did not \nhave to make payments on the time share if he was not using it. (Tr. 26) The balance as \nof March 2002, when the Applicant made his last payment, was $8,376. Since the last \npayment interest continues to accrue. (Ex. D) \n \n \nIn April 2000, Applicant purchased a home for $150,000 on which is owed \n$135,000. (Tr. 50) He has two loans on the home. He pays 9.3 percent interest on one \nnote and 13.2 percent interest on the second. (Tr. 34) Two months before the hearing \nhe was late on paying the second note. (Tr. 35) In 2005, he was more than two months \nlate on his payments, but was able to bring them current.  \n \n\n \n \n \n \nIn May 2000, he purchased a refrigerator, washer, and dryer for his new house. \nSince the purchase, Applicant made no payments on the refrigerator debt. (Tr. 23) A \ncredit collection agency is attempting to collect $1,965 on the debt (SOR \u00b6 1.b). Another \ncredit collection agency is attempting to collect a $3,081 debt (SOR \u00b6 1.c) for a washer \nand dryer purchase. In May 2007, Applicant answered interrogatories about his \nfinances. (Ex 2) At that time, he stated he did not know the collection agencies and \nwould be contacting them to attempt to make a repayment arrangement. \n \n \nA credit collection agency is attempting to collect a $417 debt (SOR \u00b6 1.a) on \nbehalf of a telephone company. Applicant stated he did have a delinquent account \nseveral years ago, but thought he had paid it. (Tr. 23) Applicant is unsure of this debt for \nhe has his telephone service with this company. A credit collection agency is attempting \nto collect a $740 debt (SOR \u00b6 1.e). In November 2007, Applicant agreed to pay $100 \nper month on the debt until it is paid. He provided a post dated check for the first \npayment. (Ex. C) \n \n \nApplicant is married and has two children, ages three and five. (Tr. 44, Ex 2) His \nsalary is $78,000 per year (Tr. 37) and his take home pay is $54,600. His wife did work \nas a case coordinator bringing home $800 every two weeks.(Tr. 44) Due to medical \nissues and taking care of their young children, she no longer works. Applicant \nanticipates his wife will return to work when the children start school. Applicant has no \ncar payments and does not live extravagantly. Applicant hopes to use his next tax \nrefund to address his debts. His tax refund last year was $9,000. (Tr. 49) He has money \nin his 401(k) company retirement fund, but does not know how much is in it and does \nnot wish to touch it. (Tr. 38) \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \n\n \n \n \n                                                          \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nUnder Guideline F for financial considerations a security concern typically exists \ndue to significant unpaid debts. Failure or inability to live within one's means, satisfy \ndebts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about \nan individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information.2 \n \nA person\u2019s relationship with his creditors is a private matter until evidence is \nuncovered demonstrating an inability or unwillingness to repay debts under agreed \nupon terms. Absent evidence of strong extenuating or mitigating circumstances, an \napplicant with a history of serious or recurring financial difficulties is in a position of risk \nthat is inconsistent with the holding of a security clearance. An applicant is not required \nto be debt free, but is required to manage his finances so as to meet his financial \nobligations. \n \n \nFinancial considerations become a security concern when a person has \nsignificant delinquent debts. An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of \nhaving to engage in illegal or unethical acts to generate funds to meet financial \n \n2 Revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) \u00b6 18. \n\n \n \n \nobligations. Additionally, an individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, negligent, or careless in properly handling and \nsafeguarding classified information. Behaving responsibly or irresponsibly in one aspect \nof life provides an indication of how a person may behave in other aspects of life.  \n \n \nThe record evidence supports a conclusion Applicant has a history of financial \nproblems. Applicant owes approximately $23,000 on five past due debts. Disqualifying \nconditions AG \u00b6 19a inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts and AG \u00b6 19c a history of \nnot meeting financial obligations, apply.  \n \n \nIn May 2000, Applicant purchased a refrigerator and has yet to make a single \npayment on the purchase. He also purchased a washer and dryer on which he owes \napproximately $3,000. He disputes the $17,000 debt on the time share. He was told he \nhad to be current on his payments or could not use the time share. He interprets the \ncomment to mean he does not have to make any payment on the debt if he chose not to \nuse the time share. The debt is owed. He acknowledged he was delinquent a few years \nago on his telephone bill, believes he paid the bill, but provided no documents \nsupporting such. He was asked about his debts in May 2007 and said he would contact \nthe creditors and arrange payment. The only debt he has made any payment on was a \n$740 debt on which he sent the creditor a $100 post-dated check.  \n \nNone of the mitigating conditions under Guideline F apply. AG \u00b6 20a the behavior \nhappened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it \nis unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment, does not apply. The debts remain unpaid so the \nbehavior did not happen long ago, was not infrequent, or occurred under circumstance \nthat it is unlikely to recur. Buying appliances and having telephone service are not \nunusual events. There is no showing the debts were incurred by factors beyond \nApplicant\u2019s control. AG \u00b6 20b the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were \nlargely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual \nacted responsibly under the circumstances, does not apply. \n \n \n There is no evidence Applicant has sought financial counseling or demonstrated \na positive change in his financial management. It is not clear the problem is being \nresolved or under control. AG \u00b6 20c the person has received or is receiving counseling \nfor the problem and there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control, does not apply nor does AG \u00b6 20d the individual initiated a good-faith \neffort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.  \n \n \nFor AG \u00b6 20d to apply there must be an \u201cability\u201d to repay the debts, the \u201cdesire\u201d \nto repay, and evidence of a good-faith effort to repay. A systematic, concrete method of \nhandling his debts is needed, which is not present here. One post-dated check is \ninsufficient.  \n \n \nApplicant has made few efforts to resolve the delinquent indebtedness nor made \nany real progress in addressing his debts. Given these circumstances, in light of the \n\n \n \n \nunaddressed delinquent debts, his efforts do not amount to a good-faith effort within the \nmeaning of the guideline.  \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness \nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation \nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent \nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.  \n \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is 35 years old and \nsufficiently mature to make prudent decisions about his finances. He knows if one buys \na refrigerator, washer, dryer, or has telephone service, he must pay the debt. He \ndisagrees with the time share debt, but he entered into a contract and has provided no \ndocumentation to establish the contract allowed him to stop making payments if he was \nnot going to use the time share. He has done little to resolve his financial problems. \nWhat is missing is: (1) a realistic and workable plan to clean up his past due obligations, \n(2) documented actions taken in furtherance of the plan, and (3) a measurable \nimprovement in the situation. Given the current circumstances, it is likely that the \nfinancial problems will be resolved \n \n \nTo conclude, Applicant did not present sufficient evidence to explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate the financial considerations security concern. Applicant did not meet his \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision. In reaching this \nconclusion, the whole-person concept was given due consideration and that analysis \ndoes not support a favorable decision. I find against Applicant as to financial \nconsiderations. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a-e: \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

In June 2004, Applicant attended a family picnic, where he drank beer from early afternoon until about an hour before his departure. On his way home, the police arrested and charged him with driving under the influence (DUI) after his breathalyzer results showed a 13% level of alcohol. Applicant had never received a ticket for DUI prior to this date. He pled guilty. The court sentenced him as a first time offender to 30 days in jail, suspended, fined him $300, $100 suspended, and restricted his driving privileges for one year, contingent upon his participation in an alcohol and substance abuse program. As directed, Applicant enrolled in an alcohol and substance abuse program. He started attending the program in October 2004 after his initial one-on-one 45 minute interview with the program director. He completed six months of weekly group counseling in April 2005 and attended 52 sessions of Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) before he completed the program in September 2005. During his time in this program, he did not drink alcohol. At no time did any counselor advise him not to drink alcohol in the future. The record contains no clinical reports from this program.

On August 2, 2007, DOHA issued a statement of reasons advising Applicant of the basis\nfor that decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline G (Alcohol Consumption) of Department\nof Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.\nOn November 29, 2007, after the hearing, Administrative Judge Mary E. Henry granted Applicant\u2019s\nrequest for a security clearance.  Department Counsel filed a timely appeal pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6\nE3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nDepartment Counsel raises the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge erred in failing\nto apply Alcohol Consumption Disqualifying Conditions (ACDC) 22(d) and (e);  and whether the\n1\nJudge\u2019s conclusion that Applicant had mitigated the security concerns alleged in the SOR was\narbitrary, capricious, and contrary to law.  Finding error, we remand the case to the Judge.  \nWhether the Record Supports the Judge\u2019s Factual Findings\nA.  Facts\nThe Judge made the following pertinent findings of fact:  Applicant began drinking beer\naround age 22 or 23. In June 2004, Applicant attended a family picnic, where he drank beer from\nearly afternoon until about an hour before his departure.  On his way home, the police arrested and\ncharged him with driving under the influence (DUI) after his breathalyzer results showed a 13% level\nof alcohol.  Applicant had never received a ticket for DUI prior to this date.  He pled guilty.  The\ncourt sentenced him as a first time offender to 30 days in jail, suspended, fined him $300, $100\nsuspended, and restricted his driving privileges for one year, contingent upon his participation in an\nalcohol and substance abuse program. \nAs directed, Applicant enrolled in an alcohol and substance abuse program. He started\nattending the program in October 2004 after his initial one-on-one 45 minute interview with the\nprogram director. He completed six months of weekly group counseling in April 2005 and attended\n52 sessions of Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) before he completed the program in September 2005.\nDuring his time in this program, he did not drink alcohol. At no time did any counselor advise him\nnot to drink alcohol in the future. The record contains no clinical reports from this program.\nSince 2005, Applicant has continued to drink beer on the weekends.  He usually consumes\nthree to four beers at one time, sometimes when watching a game.  He will occasionally drink a\nmixed drink when out.  He may not drink anything for a week or more.  Since completing the alcohol\nprogram, he will not drive if he drinks two beers at home.  He has not experienced any blackouts as\na result of his drinking.  He does not drink in the morning.  His work attendance record for the last\nseven years indicates that he regularly arrives at work on time and does not miss work on a regular\nbasis because of unexcused absences or health reasons.  This record supports his statement that he\n\nSee Government Exhibit (GE) 5, Memo from Director, dated May 12, 2007.  This document states that blood\n2\nin urine \u201cis sometimes found in individuals who have considerable liver damage . . .\u201d\nSee GE 6, Memo from Director, dated September 16, 2007.  \n3\n3\nhas not missed work because of alcohol usage. He denies an alcohol problem.  His supervisor has\nnever sent him to the clinic because of alcohol use.\nAfter completing his SF-86, he returned to the same alcohol and substance abuse program\nfor an evaluation at the request of his security office.  He met with the same director in May 2007\nfor approximately 45 minutes and provided her with a urine sample.  At the hearing, he admitted that\nhe had not been truthful with her about when he last consumed alcohol.  He told her he had not\nconsumed alcohol in one month, when it had been two days.\nThe Director, who is a Licensed Professional Counselor (LPC), Licensed Marital and Family\nTherapist (LNFT) and Licensed Substance Abuse Treatment Practioner (LSATP), prepared a written\nreport on this interview and the one urine test result.  Based on the positive ethylglucuronide reading,\nhis statement that there was blood in his urine test at work in March 2007, treatment history (without\nany further information), and his lack of honesty in self-reporting his alcohol use, the Director\nrecommended an intensive treatment program of at least six months after a complete medical\nevaluation and liver enzyme testing program.   In a supplemental report, the Director stated that\n2\nApplicant\u2019s diagnosis after the May 2007 interview was Alcohol Dependence 303.90 (with\ntolerance). The supplemental report reflects that the diagnosis is based on his urine test results.3\nApplicant has not followed up with the recommended treatment. However, he consulted with a\nprofessional counselor about an evaluation.  The counselor advised that it would take four or five\nsessions at least to provide an evaluation.\nApplicant\u2019s most recent performance evaluation by his current supervisor rated him at 4, the\nhighest rating available.  His supervisor from late 2004 until early 2007 describes Applicant as a\ndependable and excellent employee with excellent attendance.  Applicant\u2019s recent credit report\nreflects that his bills are paid in a timely manner and his finances are well managed.\nB.  Discussion\nThe Appeal Board\u2019s review of the Judge\u2019s findings of facts is limited to determining if they\nare supported by substantial evidence\u2013\u201csuch relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept\nas adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the record.\u201d  Directive\n\u00b6 E3.1.32.1.  \u201cThis is something less than the weight of the evidence, and the possibility of drawing\ntwo inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent an administrative agency\u2019s finding\nfrom being supported by substantial evidence.\u201d  Consolo v. Federal Maritime Comm\u2019n, 383 U.S.\n607, 620-21 (1966).  In evaluating the Judge\u2019s findings, we are required to give deference to the\nJudge\u2019s credibility determinations.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1. \n\nDecision at 7.  \n4\n4\nDepartment Counsel has not expressly challenged the Judge\u2019s factual findings.  Therefore,\nthey are not at issue in this appeal.\nWhether the Record Supports the Judge\u2019s Ultimate Conclusions\n A Judge is required to \u201cexamine the relevant data and articulate a satisfactory explanation\nfor\u201d the decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the facts found and the choices made.\u2019\u201d\nMotor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n of the United States v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43\n(1983)(quoting Burlington Truck Lines, Inc. v. United States, 371 U.S. 156, 168 (1962)).  \u201cThe\ngeneral standard is that a clearance may be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests\nof the national security.\u2019\u201d  Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  The Appeal\nBoard may reverse the Judge\u2019s decision to grant, deny, or revoke a security clearance if it is arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.  Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.32.3 and E3.1.33.3.  \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility, there is a strong\npresumption against the grant or maintenance of a security clearance.  See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913\nF. 2d 1399, 1401 (9  Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991).  After the government presents\nth\nevidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the applicant to establish any appropriate\nmitigating conditions.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  \u201cThe application of disqualifying and mitigating\nconditions and whole-person factors does not turn simply on a finding that one or more of them\napply to the particular facts of a case.  Rather, their application requires the exercise of sound\ndiscretion in light of the record evidence as a whole.\u201d  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 05-03635 at 3 (App.\nBd. Dec. 20, 2006).\nIn deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are arbitrary or capricious, the Board\nwill review the Judge's decision to determine whether:  it does not examine relevant evidence; it fails\nto articulate a satisfactory explanation for its conclusions, including a rational connection between\nthe facts found and the choice made; it does not consider relevant factors; it reflects a clear error of\njudgment; it fails to consider an important aspect of the case; it offers an explanation for the decision\nthat runs contrary to the record evidence; or it is so implausible that it cannot be ascribed to a mere\ndifference of opinion.  In deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are contrary to law,\nthe Board will consider whether they are contrary to provisions of Executive Order 10865, the\nDirective, or other applicable federal law.  See ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Jun. 2,\n2006).\nIn evaluating possible Disqualifying Conditions, the Judge rejected Department Counsel\u2019s\nargument that ACDC 22(d) and (e) apply in Applicant\u2019s case, stating that the Director of the alcohol\nabuse program was neither \u201ca qualified medical professional [nor] a licensed social worker.\u201d   The\n4\nJudge went on to cite what she believed were problems with the Director\u2019s diagnosis of Applicant\u2019s\nalcohol dependence, for example that she did not use \u201cthe recommended standards and criteria set\nforth\u201d in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) IV and that she failed\n\nId.  \n5\nDirective \u00b6 E2.21.\n6\nId. at \u00b6\u00b6 E2.22(d), (e).  \n7\n5\n\u201cto provide a proper analytical basis\u201d for her conclusion.   The Judge also noted that the Director did\n5\nnot provide information as to the substance of Applicant\u2019s treatment history.  \nDepartment Counsel argues that the Judge applied an overly strict definition of the terms\n\u201cmedical professional\u201d and \u201clicensed social worker.\u201d  He also argues that the Judge\u2019s analysis of the\nDirector\u2019s opinion did not have a sufficient evidentiary foundation in the record.  The Board finds\nDepartment Counsel\u2019s arguments persuasive.    \nAlcohol abuse raises security concerns in that it can lead \u201cto the exercise of questionable\njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability\nand trustworthiness.\u201d   The Directive states that \u201c[c]onditions that could raise a security concern\u201d\n6\ninvolving alcohol \u201cinclude . . .diagnosis by a duly qualified medical professional (e.g., physician,\nclinical psychologist, or psychiatrist) of alcohol abuse or alcohol dependence; [and/or] evaluation\nof alcohol abuse or alcohol dependence by a licensed clinical social worker who is a staff member\nof a recognized alcohol treatment program . . .\u201d   In this case, the official in question holds licensures\n7\nin counseling and in the treatment of substance abuse.  Furthermore, she directs a substance abuse\ncounseling center that met the requirements of Applicant\u2019s court-ordered treatment regimen. \nThe Board concludes that a diagnosis of alcohol dependence by such an official raises a\nsecurity concern under Guideline G and that the Judge\u2019s contrary decision is based upon an\nunreasonably narrow interpretation of the Directive.  It is true that the record contains no evidence\nexplicitly identifying the Director as a physician, clinical psychologist, psychiatrist, or  social worker.\nHowever, ACDC 22(d) and (e) contemplate a broad range of providers who, by education and by\nposition, are qualified to diagnose and treat alcohol dependence and other substance abuse disorders.\nBy its own terms, \u00b6 22(d) lists the previously mentioned types of care providers by way of example\nonly.  The Judge\u2019s own findings place the Director within this criteria.  Even a person who defines\nthe terms in ACDC 22(d) and (e) narrowly, however, must still acknowledge that \u00b6 22 is not an\nexhaustive and exclusive list of disqualifying conditions; rather, the word \u201cinclude\u201d in the preamble\nsignals that the matters listed are illustrative in nature and do not provide a Judge with a basis to\nconclude that factors or categories not explicitly described do not raise security concerns.  In\nanalyzing cases before them, Judges must be guided by common sense and with a view toward\nmaking a reasoned determination consistent with the interests of national security.  The Judge\u2019s\nconclusions regarding ACDC 22(d) and (e) are error.\nDepartment Counsel argues that the Judge erred in concluding that the Director\u2019s diagnosis\nof alcohol dependence was not credible.  The Judge stated that the diagnosis was not credible\n\nDecision at 7.  \n8\nDecision at 4; Applicant Exhibit (AE) H.  \n9\nDecision at 7.  \n10\nGE 2, Interrogatories, at 2.  \n11\nGE 1, Security Clearance Application, at 24; GE 3, FBI Identification Record, at 2; Tr. at 39.\n12\nGE1 at 24; Tr. at 41.\n13\n6\nbecause it was \u201cnot supported by underlying documentation and a proper analysis.\u201d    The Judge\n8\nstated this in support of her view that ACDC 22 (d) and (e) were not germane to Applicant\u2019s case.\nDepartment Counsel contends that the Judge\u2019s conclusion on this matter was made without a\nsufficient evidentiary foundation.  \nAs stated above, the diagnosis was contained in memos submitted to DOHA at its own\nrequest after Applicant listed the Director by name as the person he chose to conduct the evaluation.\nThey are not medical records, but appear to summarize the evaluation which the counseling center\nconducted.  The Judge cites to no evidence in the record from which one can reasonably conclude\nthat the Director did not utilize accepted standards, criteria, or methodology in making her diagnosis,\nnor is there any evidence that would otherwise impugn her competence.  Furthermore, although\nApplicant has consulted with a psychotherapist not connected with the Director\u2019s counseling center,9\nthere is nothing in the file, whether through documents or through expert testimony, that challenges\nthe Director\u2019s methodology or contradicts her diagnosis.  The Judge stated that the Director\u2019s report\n\u201cdoes not reference his earlier treatment in her program, any prior diagnosis, any prior\nrecommendations to abstain from drinking alcohol, or any previous prognosis.\u201d     This statement\n10\nis partially incorrect in that the Director\u2019s report makes clear references to Applicant\u2019s prior\nparticipation in an alcohol treatment program.  The Judge\u2019s own findings acknowledge that\nApplicant\u2019s treatment following his conviction consisted of six months of weekly counseling\nsessions and 52 sessions of AA.  Furthermore, the interrogatories contain background information\nto the effect that Applicant\u2019s records from this treatment show that he was diagnosed with alcohol\ndependence during the period between October 2004 and April 2005.   There is no reason to believe\n11\nthat the Director failed to provide the information which DOHA requested.  Even if the matters she\nsubmitted were less detailed a statement of Applicant\u2019s treatment and medical condition than was\npossible, that fact alone does not justify a negative conclusion as to the sufficiency of her\nmethodology or the credibility of her diagnosis and report.  Given the Board\u2019s conclusion that the\nJudge erred in failing to address security concerns raised by the Director\u2019s diagnosis, it was\nApplicant\u2019s responsibility to demonstrate that the diagnosis was unworthy of belief.     \nTo summarize, the record contains substantial evidence of the following: Applicant was\narrested and convicted of DUI.   The court ordered him to receive alcohol counseling.   Applicant\n12\n13\n\nTr. at 38; GE 2 at 2.  \n14\nGE 2 at 2.  \n15\nId.  \n16\nGE 5, 6.  \n17\nGE 5.\n18\nApplicant\u2019s reply to SOR at 2.  \n19\nTr. at 70 - 75.  \n20\n7\nreceived this counseling at a center managed by the Director.   He completed this counseling in\n14\nApril 2005 and was diagnosed with alcohol dependence.   As part of his security clearance\n15\ninvestigation, Applicant was directed by DOHA to identify a person to conduct a follow-up\nevaluation.  Applicant chose the Director and her counseling center.   The Director\u2019s response to\n16\nDOHA, contained in two letters written in 2007, diagnose him as alcohol dependent.   The response\n17\nfurther states that chemical testing revealed that Applicant was not truthful in having denied alcohol\nuse.   The Director recommended that Applicant undergo an abstinence-based treatment program\n18\nrequiring 12-step attendance and random urine and breath testing.   However, Applicant has\n19\ncontinued to consume alcohol.   The Board concludes that the Judge\u2019s favorable security clearance\n20\ndecision failed to take into account record evidence that established a security concern arising from\nApplicant\u2019s diagnosis of alcohol dependence and subsequent continued alcohol use.  As a\nconsequence, the Judge\u2019s analysis was arbitrary, capricious, and contrary to law in that it did not\nevaluate the record evidence in the context of Applicant\u2019s burden of persuasion as to mitigation.  The\nBoard concludes that the best resolution of this case would be to remand it to the Judge for a new\ndecision consistent with this opinion.  \nOrder\nThe Judge\u2019s favorable security clearance decision is REMANDED.  \nSigned: Jeffrey D.
