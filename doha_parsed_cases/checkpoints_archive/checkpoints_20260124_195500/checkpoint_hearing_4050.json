Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on March 29, 2022. On\nSeptember 21, 2022, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility \n(CAF) sent her a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging security concerns under Guideline \nF. The CAF acted under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense \n(DOD) Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) \nimplemented by the DOD on June 8, 2017.  \n \nOn September 28, 2022, Applicant responded to the SOR (Answer), and \nrequested a decision based on the written record in lieu of a hearing. On November 21, \n2022, the Government sent Applicant a complete copy of its written case, a file of relevant \nmaterial (FORM) including evidentiary documents identified as Items 1 through 6.

She timely submitted three responses, \nincluding documentary evidence, dated December 12, 2022, January 8, 2023, and \nJanuary 27, 2023, which I marked as Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AE) A through C, respectively. \nThe case was assigned to me on February 16, 2023. \nEvidentiary Matters \nItems 1 and 2 contain the pleadings in the case. Without objection, Items 3 through \n6, and AE A through C, are admitted into evidence. Although Item 4 was not authenticated \nas required by Directive \u00b6 E3.1.20, I conclude that Applicant waived any objection to Item \n4. The Government included in the FORM a prominent notice advising Applicant of her \nright to object to the admissibility of Item 4 on the ground that it was not authenticated. \nApplicant was also notified that if she did not raise an objection to Item 4 in her response \nto the FORM, she could be considered to have waived any such objection, and that Item \n4 could be considered as evidence in his case. Applicant did not raise any such objection \nin her FORM responses. \nOn March 14, 2023, for good cause and without objection from the Government, I \nreopened the record to receive additional exhibits that I admitted into evidence collectively \nas AE D. I appended to the record as Administrative Exhibit (AX) I the Government\u2019s \nargument against mitigation in response to AE D. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant, age 39, has three children, ages 13, 15, and 19, the eldest of which \ncurrently resides with her. Her two youngest children reside with their father, her first \nhusband, to whom she was married from 2006 until they divorced in early 2015. She \nremarried in 2021. She received her Generalized Education Development credential in \n2001. She has been employed as a junior financial analyst by a defense contractor since \nApril 2022. She did not report any periods of unemployment in her SCA. This is her first \napplication for a security clearance. (Items 3, 4) \nThe SOR alleged two debts, a $37,993 home equity line of credit (HELOC) (SOR \n\u00b6 1.a) and a $653 credit-card account (SOR \u00b6 1.b). Applicant admitted both allegations in \nher Answer. \nApplicant co-signed the HELOC with an original balance of $50,000 in May 2008 \nwith her first husband to remodel a garage and add an addition to their marital home. Her \nhusband was the \u201cprimary applicant\u201d on the HELOC. The mortgage on the home was \nsolely in her husband\u2019s name. The HELOC remained in good standing until June 2016, \nwhen her then ex-husband stopped making payments. The lender charged off the debt, \nin the amount of $37,883, to profit and loss in May 2017, as alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a.

She also resumed living with him again until \nDecember 2014, when he was incarcerated for committing an act of domestic violence \nagainst her. Due to the nature of their separation, she agreed to an uncontested divorce \nto expedite the process. Before finalizing their divorce, she and her first husband reached \na verbal agreement that he would be solely responsible for repaying the HELOC as he \nretained exclusive possession of their former marital home with their children. In her \nAnswer, Applicant stated, \u201cThere was a verbal, non contractual [sic] agreement with no \ndocumentation nor court order naming him the responsible party and relinquishing myself \nof the obligation,\u201d and \u201cThe verbal agreement was reached due to his ownership of the \nhome used as collateral to obtain the HELOC and my financial capabilities at the time.\u201d \n(Items 2, 4, 5, 6) \nFollowing Applicant\u2019s initial separation from her first husband, she was unable to \nprovide an ideal home for her children. In December 2012, upon the petitions filed by both \nfathers, the court awarded custody of the two youngest children to her first husband and \nthe eldest to her child\u2019s father. At that time, the court also ordered Applicant to pay child \nsupport of $343 per month to her first husband and $303 per month to her eldest child\u2019s \nfather. Her then annual gross income was $26,000. After deductions for child support and \nhealth insurance for the family, her net income was \u201cbarely above $600\u201d per month and \nrendered her \u201cincapable\u201d of repaying the HELOC. (Items 2, 5) \nOnce the divorce was finalized in early 2015, Applicant and her first husband no \nlonger communicated about finances. They did not discuss the HELOC again until 2017, \nwhen her first husband advised Applicant of his and their children\u2019s new home address \ndue to the short sale of their former marital home. At that time, he conveyed to her that \nhe expected the proceeds of the short sale to cover the then delinquent balance of the \nHELOC. It was not until October 2018, during an attempt to finance the purchase of a \nvehicle, that Applicant learned the HELOC remained in delinquent status. She \nimmediately contacted her first husband and he advised her that he would contact the \nlender to investigate why it was not satisfied through the short sale. In her Answer, she \nstated, \u201chis ownership of the home used as collateral [for the HELOC] as well as being \nthe primary applicant on the [HELOC] is why I continued to look to him for answers versus \ncontacting the lender myself. I understand this does not excuse me from taking \nresponsibility as the co-signer of this debt.\u201d (Item 2) \nIn her April 2022 SCA, Applicant reported that she resolved a $7,000 child support \ndebt. Beginning in December 2014, she fell behind in her child support payments, due to \nthe lack of a steady income. She maintained full-time work with the same employer in the \nhealth care industry from January 2008 until July 2014, when she left to work a more part-\ntime schedule so that she could be home more for her children. In August 2013, she \nobtained a second job working part time nights and weekends as a bartender and server \nin the restaurant industry. In August 2014, she transitioned her part-time position to full \ntime and continued to work nights and weekends. In June 2015, she took on a second \npart-time job working as a janitor in her local government until she was laid off in February \n2016. She continued working in the same restaurant position until September 2017, when \nshe determined that she \u201cno longer needed the supplemental income.\u201d (Items 3, 5) \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nDuring her April 2022 security clearance interview (SI), Applicant explained that, \nalthough she fell behind in her child support payments in December 2014, she continued \nto make partial payments. In December 2017, both fathers of her children filed a petition \nin December 2017 to settle the $7,000 arrearage. Both fathers agreed to release \nApplicant from the $7,000 arrearage in exchange for Applicant\u2019s agreement to pay the full \namount of her child support obligation going forward. Applicant had been paying the full \namount from October 2017 through at least April 2022. Given the financial stability \nafforded by her then new full-time position with her current employer, she expected to be \nable to continue paying the full amount through her children\u2019s 18th birthdays. The child \nsupport debt was reported as \u201cclosed or paid,\u201d with a $0 balance in her April and August \n2022 credit bureau reports (CBRs). As this debt was not alleged in the SOR, it will be \nconsidered solely to evaluate mitigation and the whole person concept. (Items 4, 5, 6) \nDuring Applicant\u2019s SI, she also addressed the two SOR debts as well as a resolved \nproperty tax debt. Attempting to rebuild her credit, Applicant opened a credit-card account \nin May 2019 with a $300 credit limit. At that time, she felt confident that she could afford \nto make the payments given her then two-income household. She used the card to pay \nfor clothing, food, and fuel. However, she fell behind in her payments in October 2019 \nbecause she could no longer afford them as her household was reduced to one income. \nNo information was available in the record concerning how she became a two-income \nhousehold or lost the second income. She defaulted on the card so that she could ensure \nhousing for herself and maintain a good payment record on her vehicle. During that time, \nshe took on a secondary job as a waitress to supplement her income. However, the \nsupplemental income was \u201csporadic and unreliable.\u201d In May 2020, the creditor charged \noff the debt, in the amount of $653 (including penalties and interest), to profit and loss in \nMarch 2020, as alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b. (Items 2, 4, 5, 6) \nAlthough her April 2022 CBR listed the credit-card debt with a $0 balance, \nApplicant told the investigator that she intended to contact the creditor to settle the debt. \nIn her Answer, she explained that she had been working to accrue enough savings to \nmake monthly payments on the account. In a December 2022 FORM response, she \nexplained that her attempts to settle the account had been thwarted because it had been \ntransferred \u201cmultiple times.\u201d On March 10, 2023, the collection agency for the debt alleged \nin SOR \u00b6 1.b confirmed that it had been paid in full. In addition, although it was not alleged \nin the SOR, in January 2023, Applicant negotiated a payment with the same collection \nagency to repay a debt for a \u201cmuch older account\u201d with a balance of $567. She agreed to \npay $72 per month from January 2023 through December 2023 to resolve that debt. (AE \nA, C, E; Item 2, 4 5, 6) \nApplicant\u2019s wages were garnished for one week in October 2017 to repay an \nunpaid $400 personal property tax debt. The tax had been assessed on a vehicle that \nwas jointly titled in her name and an ex-boyfriend\u2019s name. When the ex-boyfriend moved \naway following their breakup, he took sole possession of the vehicle and verbally agreed \nto pay all expenses associated with the vehicle, including the property tax. Applicant was \nnot aware of the existence of the tax debt until her wages were garnished. Because this \ndebt was not alleged in the SOR, it will be considered solely to evaluate mitigation and \nthe whole person concept.

Sometime between \nthe completion of her SCA and the SI, she learned, for the first time, that her marital home \nhad been foreclosed upon (not sold via short sale). She also became aware that the \nHELOC remained in delinquent status. In her Answer, Applicant acknowledged her \nresponsibility for repaying the debt as a co-signer on the HELOC. She expected that she \nwould be able to repay the debt given the salary increase associated with her current \nemployment. She intended to reach out to the lender to negotiate a \u201cfinancially feasible\u201d \nrepayment agreement. She anticipated that she may have to file bankruptcy if she could \nnot arrange a payment arrangement that she could afford. (Item 2) \nIn her December 2022 FORM response, Applicant explained that she had been in \ncontact with the HELOC creditor. The creditor advised that there was a significant \ndiscrepancy between the balance owed on the HELOC according to their records and the \namount being reported on Applicant\u2019s credit report. The creditor advised Applicant that it \nwould be in her best interest to file a dispute with the credit bureau to resolve the issue. \nThe creditor also reviewed various repayment options. Applicant planned to begin \nrepaying the debt once the credit bureau resolved her dispute. In the meantime, she also \nconsulted with an attorney about filing a Chapter 13 bankruptcy. Based upon the advice \nreceived, she and her current husband were exploring the option of filing for Chapter 13 \nto consolidate their debts to gain a lower monthly payment. On December 21, 2022, \nbased on its research of the account, the credit bureau resolved the dispute by deleting \nthe HELOC debt from Applicant\u2019s CBR. (AE A, B, D). \nNo new delinquent debts were reported on Applicant\u2019s August 2022 CBR. All \naccounts reported on Applicant\u2019s March 9, 2023 CBR were in good standing. She intends \nto maintain her credit going forward. In her Answer, she stated, \u201cThe fluctuation in my \ncredit score as well as the delinquency of these accounts has impacted my life \ntremendously and I have learned how important it is to uphold financial obligations as \nagreed to do so.\u201d She does not intend to make any future payments to the HELOC creditor \ndue to the successful resolution of her dispute with the credit bureau. (AE D; Item 2) \nPolicies \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d (Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988)). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d (Egan at 527). \nThe President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant \napplicants eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d (EO 10865 \u00a7 2) \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the AG. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, \nrecognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies these \nguidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person.

This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d (EO 10865 \u00a7 \n7). Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant has \nnot met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established \nfor issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. (Egan at 531). \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d \nis \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d (See v. Washington Metro. Area \nTransit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994)). The guidelines presume a nexus or \nrational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria listed therein and \nan applicant\u2019s security suitability. ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial evidence, the \nburden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts. (Directive \n\u00b6 E3.1.15). An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, and the burden \nof disproving it never shifts to the Government. (ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. \nSep. 22, 2005)) \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his [or her] security clearance.\u201d (ISCR Case \nNo. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002)). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should \nerr, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d (Egan at 531; AG \u00b6 2(b)) \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information.

An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . . .  \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. (ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012)) \nThe record evidence and Applicant\u2019s admissions establish the following \ndisqualifying conditions under this guideline: AG \u00b6 19(a) (inability to satisfy debts) and AG \n\u00b6 19(c) (a history of not meeting financial obligations). \nI considered each of the factors set forth in AG \u00b6 20 that could mitigate the concern \nunder this guideline and find the following relevant: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred  \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and  \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \nApplicant successfully disputed the HELOC debt thereby resolving SOR \u00b6 1.a. \nShe paid the credit-card debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b in full. She incurred the HELOC debt \nunder circumstances that were beyond her control and are not likely to recur. Her first \nhusband agreed to repay the HELOC debt as part of the terms of their divorce, which was \nreasonable given that he retained possession of the marital home and held the primary \nmortgage in his sole name. He failed to pay the HELOC as promised. He also failed to \nprovide Applicant notice of the home\u2019s foreclosure and the HELOC\u2019s default. Despite \nthese circumstances, Applicant acknowledged, that as a co-signer on the loan, she was \nresponsible for the HELOC debt and initiated efforts to resolve it with the creditor. She \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nalso consulted with a bankruptcy attorney to explore options should she be unsuccessful \nin negotiating a feasible repayment plan. The creditor provided her with a reasonable \nbasis to dispute the debt with the credit bureau. Based on its research, the credit bureau \ndeleted the debt from her credit report. \nApplicant addressed the SOR debts within her means. None of her debts resulted \nfrom irresponsible spending. Considering the record as a whole and the resolution of both \nSOR debts, I conclude that her indebtedness is resolved, unlikely to recur, and no longer \ncasts doubt about her reliability, trustworthiness, and judgment. that AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), 20(b), \n20(d), and 20(e) apply to mitigate the Guideline F concerns. \nWhole-Person Analysis \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether the granting or continuing \nof national security eligibility is clearly consistent with the interests of national security \nmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nadjudicative guidelines, each of which is to be evaluated in the context of the whole \nperson. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors \nlisted at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis, \nand I have considered the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). After weighing the disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions under Guideline F and evaluating all the evidence in the context of \nthe whole person, I conclude that Applicant has mitigated the security concerns raised by \nthe debts alleged in the SOR. Accordingly, Applicant has carried her burden of showing \nthat it is clearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant her eligibility for \naccess to classified information. \n[intentional blank space] \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by Section \nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.b: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is clearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant \nApplicant eligibility for access to classified information.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n       \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant has a history of financial problems and delinquent debts. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) \nand 19(c) are applicable. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant had a good income while working overseas from about 2009 to 2013. \nHe did not make as much when he returned and relied on credit. His balances \nincreased to the point where it was difficult to keep up. He contracted with a debt-\nsettlement company in June 2018 to assist him in resolving his debts. As of August \n2023, he had deposited $44,096 into the escrow account, and it had a balance of \n$4,084 available for settlement payments. Four non-SOR debts totaling about $30,500 \nwere settled and paid before the SOR was issued. The $3,889 charged-off debt alleged \nin SOR \u00b6 1.d has been settled and paid. The $20,000 and $1,117 debts alleged in SOR \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.c and 1.e have been settled with payments issued.

The process has taken longer than he anticipated, but it is working \nfor him, and he is committed to it. His finances are not perfect, but they are better than \nthey were. He has the means to continue with the program until completion. \nApplicant does not present a perfect case in mitigation, but perfection is not \nrequired. A security clearance adjudication is not a debt-collection procedure. It is a \nprocedure designed to evaluate an applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. \nSee ISCR Case No. 09-02160 (App. Bd. Jun. 21, 2010). An applicant is not required, as \na matter of law, to establish resolution of every debt alleged in the SOR. An applicant \nneed only establish a plan to resolve the financial problems and take significant actions \nto implement the plan. There is no requirement that an applicant make payments on all \ndelinquent debts simultaneously, nor is there a requirement that the debts alleged in the \nSOR be paid first. See ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008). \nApplicant still has debts to resolve, but I believe he is honest and sincere in his \nintentions to address his debts through the debt-resolution program. I find that he has a \nplan to resolve his financial problems, and he took significant action to implement that \nplan. He acted responsibly under the circumstances and made a good-faith effort to pay \nhis debts. It may take time, but I am convinced he will eventually resolve his financial \nproblems. See ISCR Case No. 08-06567 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct 29, 2009) and ISCR Case \nNo. 09-08462 at 4 (App. Bd. May. 31, 2011): \u201cDepending on the facts of a given case, \nthe fact that an applicant\u2019s debts will not be paid off for a long time, in and of itself, may \nbe of limited security concern.\u201d The above mitigating conditions are sufficiently \napplicable to mitigate financial considerations security concerns. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. I also considered Applicant\u2019s \nhonorable military service. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nAppendix C of the adjudicative guidelines gives me the authority to grant \nconditional eligibility \u201cdespite the presence of issue information that can be partially but \nnot completely mitigated, with the provision that additional security measures shall be \nrequired to mitigate the issue(s).\u201d I have not done so as I have concluded the issues are \ncompletely mitigated, and it is unnecessary to further monitor Applicant\u2019s finances. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant \nmitigated the financial considerations security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.h: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance.

He helps with the animals \nand does maintenance around the farm. He has no outside employment.

She attributed being unable to pay for it due to the pandemic. She told the \ninvestigator that she would contact the creditor to arrange monthly payments and resolve \nthe debt within a year. She testified that she moved in with her mother when her mother \nneeded help. She returned the car because she knew she would not be able to make the \npayments.

(Tr. 24, 45-47; GE 5) \nApplicant initially testified that the reason she failed to disclose she had delinquent \ndebts was because she was confused and nervous and she had recently moved. She \nsaid she had not received inquiries from creditors about her debts but knew her credit \nwas bad. She said she realized she should have responded to the SF 85 inquiries \ndifferently. When questioned further, she admitted that she was aware that she had a \nnumber of debts that were delinquent and was aware her vehicle had been voluntarily \nrepossessed. She said she did not intentionally lie about her debts. When asked why she \nfailed to disclose them, she stated, \u201cbecause I was afraid I wouldn\u2019t get the job.\u201d She \nfurther stated that her medical issues have an impact on her memory. I find Applicant was \naware she had delinquent debts and was aware of her duty to truthfully disclose her \ndelinquencies and deliberately failed to do so. (Tr. 23, 63-68; GE 1, 5) \nApplicant acknowledged the credit card debt in SOR \u00b6 1.b ($3,600), which became \ndelinquent in approximately November 2019. She told the investigator she was unable to \npay it due to insufficient income but intended to satisfy it with monthly payments within \nfive years. She testified the creditor reached out to her to settle the debt for $1,800. She \nsaid she contacted the creditor in August 2023. She is attempting to settle the debt for a \nlump-sum amount. In her post-hearing submission, she provided a document with the \nsettlement offer. She wrote on the document that she intended to accept the offer and \nsettle the debt by the end of 2023. This debt is not resolved. (Tr. 48-50; GE 2, 3, 4, 5; AE \nJ, N) \nApplicant testified that she paid the collection account in SOR \u00b6 1.c ($2,773) for a \ndelinquent credit card. The record was held open for her to provide documents to \nsubstantiate her payments. She provided documents to show that she received a letter \nfrom the creditor in June 2022 indicating it had filed a lawsuit against her. She provided \nreceipts from July, August, and September 2022 showing she paid the amount owed. She \ndid not provide evidence that the creditor accepted her payments and is no longer \npursuing legal action, but based on her payments, it appears the debt is resolved. (Tr. 37, \n40, 44-45; AE J, K) \nApplicant testified that she paid the collection account in SOR \u00b6 1.h ($1,614) for a \ndelinquent credit card. She said the debt date back to 2019.

She provided a document \nfrom the creditor from August 2022 offering her a settlement agreement. She paid the \nsettlement amount in December 2022. Although there is no confirmation letter indicating \nthe debt is resolved, based on the documents it appears it is resolved. (Tr. 37, 40-45; AE \nI, J, K, L) \nApplicant resolved the collection accounts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d ($2,524-settled for $631) \nand 1.e ($2,499-settled for $606) in August 2022 and are reflected as paid on her January \n2023 credit report and other documents provided. (Tr. 36-37; GE 4; AE J, O, P) \nThe credit card debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f ($1,901) and 1.g ($1,807) are owed to the \nsame creditor. Regarding the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.g, Applicant told the investigator she would \ncontact the creditor in January 2022 and arrange monthly payments to satisfy the debts \nin one year. She testified that she made a partial payment on the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.f and \nwould provide documents to substantiate her actions. The record was held open for her \nto provide documents to substantiate her payments. She provided a document showing \nthat in early October 2023 she made a $1,000 payment and in late October she made a \npayment of $901 to resolve the balance owed on the debt. SOR \u00b6 1.f is resolved. SOR \n1.g is not resolved. (GE 2, 3, 4, 5; AE I, M)  \nThe debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.i ($75) and 1.k ($35) are unpaid medical debts. Applicant \ntold the investigator that she forgot to pay the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.k and she did not know \nwho the creditor was. She intended to pay this bill. She told the investigator that she \nintended to satisfy the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.i with a lump-sum payment within six months. She \nadmitted she has been irresponsible in paying her bills. At her hearing, she testified that \nshe did not know who the creditor was for the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.i, and she took no action \nto find out who it might be. The accounts remain unpaid. (Tr. 54-55, 57; GE 2, 3, 4, 5) \nThe debt in SOR \u00b6 1.j ($49) is an unpaid cable bill. She told the government \ninvestigator that she forgot to pay the remaining cable bill when she vacated her \nresidence. She intended to satisfy the debt within two weeks. She testified that when she \nvacated her residence, she thought the cable was turned off. She has not contacted the \ncreditor to dispute the debt and has not paid the bill. (Tr. 56; GE 2, 3, 4, 5) \nApplicant testified that with her limited income, she is doing the best she can. She \nincurred student loan debt in 2003 and due to her disability, she was told she did not have \nto repay the loans. However, in 2015, when for a period she worked full time, the loans \nwere reinstated. She has not made any payments since 2015. The loans were delinquent \nprior to the pandemic and are currently in a deferred status. She owes approximately \n$6,625. (Tr. 58, 62-63) \nApplicant testified that she and her husband have about $1,100 in their bank \naccounts. They do not have retirement accounts or investments. They do not provide \nfinancial support for anyone. After paying their monthly expenses there is minimal \nexpendable income.

(Tr. 24, 29-31, 34-35, 59-60) \nApplicant provided character letters.

In addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, \n \n \n \n \n \n \nthe adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating \n \n \n \n \n \n \nconditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to sensitive \n \ninformation. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\n \n \n \n \n \n \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \n \n \n \n \n \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \n \ndecision. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe protection of the sensitive information is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 \n \n \n \n \n \n2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nsecurity eligibility [or eligibility for a public trust position] will be resolved in favor of the \n \n \n \n \n \n \nnational security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are \n \n \n \nreasonable, logical, and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have\n \navoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \n \n \n \n \n \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \n \n \n  \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable public trust decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \n \n \n \n \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nsensitive information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard sensitive information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of sensitive information. \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe trustworthiness concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is \nset out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nAG \u00b6 19 provides conditions that could raise trustworthiness concerns. The \nfollowing are potentially applicable: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant has numerous delinquent debts and a history of financial problems. \nThere is sufficient evidence to apply the above disqualifying conditions. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate trustworthiness concerns \narising from financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are \npotentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant receives Social Security disability and works to supplement her income. \nHer husband does not work but they live rent-free because he manages the farm where \nthey are provided a house. She attributes her financial problems to being underemployed, \nunemployed during the pandemic, and caring for her elderly mother. She is unable to pay \nall of her debts. \nAfter completing her SF 85 and her interview with a government investigator, \nApplicant began addressing some of her delinquent debts and was able to settle several \nof them. She still has others that are not resolved, including a debt for a car she purchased \nand then returned to the dealer (SOR \u00b6 1.a $6,305). Her debts are ongoing and recent, \nand there is insufficient evidence that future financial problems are unlikely to recur. AG \n\u00b6 20(a) does not apply. \nThe conditions that resulted in Applicant\u2019s debts were beyond her control. For the \nfull application of AG \u00b6 20(b), she must have acted responsibly under the circumstances. \nShe was employed in 2021. After her interview with the government investigator, she \nbegan to address some of her debts. AG \u00b6 20(b) has some application but does not \ncompletely apply. \nThere is no evidence that Applicant participated in financial counseling and there \nare not clear indications that Applicant\u2019s finances are under control. She still has her \nlargest debt to resolve and has not paid some of her smaller ones. AG \u00b6 20(c) does not \napply. AG \u00b6 20(d) has some application in that some debts are paid, but I do not consider \nher actions to be made in good faith as the collectors were contacting her and offering \nsettlements and one had filed a lawsuit. Applicant presented some mitigation, but her \nfinancial situation remains unstable, and the evidence is insufficient to mitigate the \nconcerns under this guideline. \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the trustworthiness concern for personal conduct: \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. The following will \nnormally result in an unfavorable national security eligibility determination, \nsecurity clearance action, or cancellation of further processing for national \nsecurity eligibility:  \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a trustworthiness concern and may \nbe disqualifying. I find the following potentially applicable: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \naward benefits or status, determine national security eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities.  \nI find Applicant deliberately falsified her SF 85 when she answered \u201cno\u201d to \nquestions about whether in the past seven years had she had any property repossessed, \nor if she had been over 120 days delinquent on any debts or if she was currently over 120 \ndays delinquent on any debt. However, these facts were not alleged in the SOR, and \nthere is insufficient evidence to conclude that she was aware that her debts were turned \nover to a collection agency or that she was aware if her accounts or credit cards were \nsuspended, charged off, or canceled for failing to pay as agreed. I find for Applicant under \nthis guideline. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a public trust position by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \npublic trust position must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuidelines E and F in my whole-person analysis. \nApplicant failed to meet her burden of persuasion under Guideline F, financial \nconsiderations. She does not have a reliable financial track record at this time. The record \nevidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability \nfor a public trust position. For these reasons, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the \ntrustworthiness concerns raised. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline: \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.b: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nSubparagraphs 1.c-1.f: \n \nFor Applicant \n \nSubparagraph   1.g:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nSubparagraph   1.h:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \nSubparagraphs 1.i-1k: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a public trust \nposition.

Administrative Judge \nBased upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, \nApplicant did not mitigate handling protected information and use of information \ntechnology concerns. Eligibility for access to classified information or to hold a sensitive \nposition is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn September 12, 2022, the Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency \n(DCSA) Consolidated Adjudications Facility (CAF) issued a statement of reasons (SOR) \nto Applicant detailing reasons why under the handling protected information and use of \ninformation technology guidelines the DCSA CAF could not make the preliminary \naffirmative determination of eligibility for granting a security clearance, and \nrecommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a security \nclearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. The action was taken \nunder Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry (February 20, 1960); Department of Defense (DoD) Directive 5220.6 Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program, (January 2, 1992) (Directive); \nand Security Executive Agent Directive 4, establishing in Appendix A the National \nSecurity Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified \nInformation or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AGs), effective June 8, 2017. \n1 \n\n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant responded to the SOR (undated), and elected to have his case decided \non the basis of the written record, in lieu of a hearing.

He did not respond to the FORM, and the case was assigned to \nme on April 11, 2023. \nSummary of Pleadings \nUnder Guideline K, Applicant allegedly committed multiple security infractions \nthat were followed by verbal and written warnings between October 2019 and March \n2021. Allegedly, these infractions and warnings are of continuing security concern. The \nallegations are cross-alleged under Guideline M. \nIn Applicant\u2019s response to the SOR, he admitted all but one of the allegations \nwith explanations. He denied only the allegations of SOR \u00b6 1.b, allowing access and \nuse of unauthorized software (Skype). He claimed there was no classified information \ninvolved in his cited October 2019 downloading infraction. He also claimed that the hard \ndrive he failed to properly secure in 2020 and 2021 he inherited from the person who \npreviously occupied his cubicle. \nApplicant claimed generally there was no formal process in place to perform a \ncomplete inventory of his office cubicle office when he started his employment with his \ncurrent employer. And, he claimed he has proven his trustworthiness through his work \nas a system administrator, in which he handled thousands of classified hard drives and \nsystem tapes, performed hundreds of software installations, and ensured that the \nclassified systems he was responsible for were compliant with all DoD security \nrequirements for the previous five plus years. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is a 60-year-old civilian of a defense contractor who seeks a security \nclearance. Allegations covered in the SOR and admitted by Applicant are incorporated \nand adopted as relevant and material findings. Additional findings follow. \nBackground \nApplicant married in June 2003 and has six children (ages 17, 15, 14, 12, 9, and \n8) from this marriage. (Item 4) Applicant earned a bachelors degree in December 1997 \nand a master\u2019s degree in May 2006. (Item 4) He enlisted in the Marine Corps in January \n1980 and served six years in the Inactive Reserve before receiving an honorable \ndischarge in June 1986. (Item 4)  \nSince March 2016, Applicant has worked for his current employer as a computer \nsystems technologist. (Item 4) Between November 2003 and March 2016, he worked for \nother employers in various systems administrator positions. (Item 4) He has held a \nsecurity clearance since April 2004.

(Items 4-6) \nRecords document that in October 2019, Applicant self-reported to his information \nsecurity systems officer (ISSO) that he downloaded classified information on a compact \ndisc (CD) without authorization in September 2019 and left it unsecured on his desk in \nhis cubicle until October 2019. (Item 6) \nFurther investigation by his ISSO confirmed that Applicant had downloaded 12 \nfiles to a CD without authorization, failed to document the trusted downloads (TD) in e-\nBinder, and failed to properly label and secure the CD. His ISSO administrators found \nno loss or compromise of classified information and advised him of the need to properly \ndownload classified information in the future to ensure his understanding of proper \ndownloading procedures. (Item 6) \nIn April 2020, Applicant (while employed by his current employer) received a \nsecurity infraction notification with a verbal warning for allowing access and use of \nunauthorized software (Skype) on a classified information system without following \nrequired cybersecurity procedures. (Item 3) Applicant denied parts of the substantive \nallegation, claiming the software had been approved by his ISSO administrator. \nHowever, he admitted that his further testing of the software was unauthorized. (Item 3) \nIn their own investigation of the April 2020 incident, Applicant\u2019s ISSO \nadministrators confirmed that another employee of the company was in the process of \ngetting the Skype for business software certified for use on the company\u2019s information \nsystem (inclusive of ensuring that certain security controls were on the system and \ncertified for use) when the employee discovered that Applicant had been allowing \nemployees to use the program before the full certification could be finalized. (Item 6) \nWhile no loss or compromise of classified information was detected, Applicant was \nissued a verbal warning. (Item 6) \nIn May 2020, while still employed by his current employer, Applicant committed a \ncompany policy infraction when he inadvertently brought a cell phone into a closed \narea. (Items 3 and 6) Employer records affirm that Applicant self-reported the incident, \nand his employer\u2019s ISSO administrators confirmed the absence of any compromise of \nclassified information. \nUpon concluding their investigation, his ISSO administrators verbally warned him \nof his violation without the issuance of a security infraction. ISSO administrators, in turn, \nreferred their findings to Applicant\u2019s supervisor for any further consideration of the \nincident. (Item 6) Company records confirmed that Applicant received a company policy \ninfraction with corrective actions deferred to management for inadvertently bringing a \ncell phone into a closed area, in violation of established procedures.

(Items 3 and \n6) Admitting the infraction, Applicant told his company\u2019s ISSO administrator that he had \nfound the classified hard drive in his desk drawer, but could not recall how the drive \narrived in his cubical. (Item 6) He told the ISSO administrator investigating the incident \nthat he last used similar drives in 2016 upon his new arrival to the company. (Item 6) \nISSO administrators, in turn took possession of the hard drive and found no nefarious \nactivities or anomalies in their audit. (Item 6)  \nISSO administrators based their findings on the absence of any exhibited activity \nwith the hard drive since 2016. (Item 6) Although, Applicant\u2019s actions were confirmed to \nbe inadvertent, he was considered to be responsible for violating established safeguard \nprocedures for storing materials bearing secret labels (as was the case with the hard \ndrive found in his cubicle drawer), and was issued a verbal warning. Applicant\u2019s claims \nthat there was no formal process to inventory their cubes when he first entered his \nemployment with his employer were neither acknowledged nor accepted by ISSO \nadministrators. (Items 3 and 6) \nMore recently (in March 2021), Applicant received a written warning for failing to \nproperly secure a classified hard drive while in a closed area. (Items 3 and 6) Claiming \nhe inherited the hard-drive from a person who occupied the cubicle before him, he \nacknowledged the incident and claimed he was told to accept the hard drive \u201cas-is\u201d \nwhen he assumed possession of the hard-drive as a new employee. (Item 3) Applicant\u2019s \nemployer\u2019s records reflect that Applicant acquired his hard drive in 2018, and the drive \nwas found when an employee of the company was moving into Applicant\u2019s cubical. \n(item 6) When asked by ISSO administrators about the hard drive, Applicant \nacknowledged his acquiring the drive when he joined the company in 2018 (believing at \nthe time that the drive was unclassified). \nISSO administrators in their investigation of the 2021 incident found Applicant\u2019s \nacquired hard drive to bear a classified label (albeit in a clear case with an unclassified \nsticker on the exterior), and, as such, was a classified hard drive that was improperly \nstored by Applicant for approximately two years without any evidence of a suspected \nloss or compromise of classified information. (Item 6) Based on the investigation\u2019s \nfindings, Applicant received a written warning. \nSince the investigated March 2021 incident, Applicant has been transferred to a \nnew position where he is no longer responsible for classified assets. (Item 5) He \nassured in his personal subject interview (PSI), conducted in February 2022, that should \nhe be assigned to another position in the chain of assets, he will be sure to check the \ninventory and ensure that all items are properly labeled. (Item 5) \nIn his defense, Applicant expressed his belief that he had proved his \ntrustworthiness through his work as a system administrator entrusted with the \nresponsibility for handling \u201cthousands of classified hard drives/tapes, performed \nhundreds software installations, and ensured the classified information systems that he \nwas responsible for were compliant with DoD requirements for over 5 years.\u201d (Item 3) \n4 \n\n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nPolicies \nBy virtue of the jurisprudential principles recognized by the U.S. Supreme Court \nin Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988), \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a \nsecurity clearance.\u201d As Commander in Chief, \u201cthe President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. \nEligibility for access to classified information may only be granted \u201cupon a finding that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe AGs list guidelines to be considered by judges in the decision-making \nprocess covering DOHA cases. These guidelines take into account factors that could \ncreate a potential conflict of interest for the individual applicant, as well as \nconsiderations that could affect the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified information. These guidelines include conditions that could raise a \nsecurity concern and may be disqualifying (disqualifying conditions), if any, and all of \nthe conditions that could mitigate security concerns, if any. These guidelines must be \nconsidered before deciding whether or not a security clearance should be granted, \ncontinued, or denied. Although, the guidelines do not require judges to place exclusive \nreliance on the enumerated disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the guidelines in \narriving at a decision. \nIn addition to the relevant AGs, judges must take into account the pertinent \nconsiderations for assessing extenuation and mitigation set forth in \u00b6 2(a) of the AGs, \nwhich are intended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and impartial, commonsense \ndecision based on a careful consideration of the pertinent guidelines within the context \nof the whole person. The adjudicative process is designed to examine a sufficient period \nof an applicant\u2019s life to enable predictive judgments to be made about whether the \napplicant is an acceptable security risk. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s conduct, the relevant guidelines are to be \nconsidered together with the following \u00b6 2(d) factors: (1) the nature, extent, and \nseriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other \npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation of the conduct; (8) the potential for \n5 \n\n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                  Handling Protected Information \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n                                   Use of Information Technology \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \nViewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following individual \nguidelines are pertinent herein: \nThe Concern. Deliberate or negligent failure to comply with rules and \nregulations for handling protected information-which includes classified \nand other sensitive government information, and proprietary information-\nraises doubt about and individual\u2019s trustworthiness, judgment, reliability, \nor willingness and ability to safeguard such information, and is a serious \nsecurity concern. .  .  . AG \u00b6 33. \nThe Concern. Failure to comply with rules, procedures, guidelines, or \nregulations pertaining to information technology systems may raise \nsecurity concerns about an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, \ncalling into question the willingness or ability to properly protect sensitive \nsystems, networks, and information. Information Technology includes \nany computer-based, mobile, or wireless device used to create, store, \naccess, process, manipulate, protect, or move information. This includes \nany component, whether integrated into a larger system, or not, such as \nhardware, software, or firmware used to enable or facilitate these \noperations.  . . . AG \u00b6 40. \nBurdens of Proof \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. \nDecisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the applicant \nmay deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information.

Although \nthere is no probative evidence of loss or compromise of classified materials, security \nconcerns remain over Applicant\u2019s history of unauthorized misuse of classified \ninformation systems that required warnings and demands for corrective actions by his \nemployer\u2019s security and management personnel. \nApplicant\u2019s repeated negligent infractions of classified systems owned and \noperated by his employer warrant the application of DCs covered by Guideline K: DC \u00b6\u00b6 \n34(g), \u201cany failure to comply with rules for the protection of classified or sensitive \ninformation,\u201d and 34(h) \u201cnegligence or lax security habits that persist despite counseling \nby management\u201d; apply to Applicant\u2019s situation. Applicable DCs under Guideline M are \nDCs \u00b6\u00b6 40(e), \u201cunauthorized use of a government or other information technology \nsystem,\u201d and 40(g), \u201cnegligent or lax security habits in handling information technology \nthat persist despite counseling by management,\u201d apply as well. \nTo be sure, none of the investigations prompted by Applicant\u2019s reported \ninadvertent misuse and mishandling of his employer\u2019s classified procedures and \nprocesses resulted in any loss or compromise of classified materials. Nonetheless, his \nmultiple breaches of established classified procedures and processes over an extended \nperiod of time (despite prior warnings and instructions) pose serious trust and judgment \nissues that effect his eligibility to access sensitive or classified information, or hold a \nsensitive position of trust. For mitigation purposes herein, the passage of time since his \nlast reported infraction in 2021 is still relatively recent. \nIn the face of proven acts of pattern negligence in misusing his employer\u2019s \nprocedures and processes for accessing and protecting classified information, \nApplicant\u2019s acknowledgments of his judgment lapses and claims of learned lessons \ncome too late to meet the mitigating requirements of any of the potentially available \nmitigating conditions under Guideline K as well as those covered by Guideline M. \n7 \n\n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n             \n     \n \n \n             \n                                                 \n \n \n      \n \nApplicant\u2019s acknowledged breaches of established procedures and processes for \naccessing classified procedures and processes breaches are still too recent to facilitate \nsafe predictions of recurrence avoidance in the foreseeable future. \nWhile this is not a close case, even close cases must be resolved in the favor of \nthe national security. See Dept. of Navy v. Egan, supra. Quite apart from any required \nadherence to rules and regulations the Government may impose on the clearance \nholder employed by a defense contractor, the Government has the right to expect care \nand good judgment from the trust relationship it has with the clearance holder. See \nSnepp v. United States, 444 U.S. 507, 511n.6 (1980) \nWhole-person assessment \nFrom a whole-person perspective, Applicant has failed to establish enough \nindependent probative evidence of his overall trustworthiness, maturity, and good \njudgment required of those who seek eligibility to hold a security clearance or sensitive \nposition. At this time, he lacks enough positive reinforcements and time in his \ndemonstrated safe use of classified procedures and processes to facilitate safe \npredictions that he is at no risk of recurrence. \nConsidering the record as a whole at this time, and granting due weight to the \nacknowledgements made by Applicant of his past trust breaches and steps he is taking \nto avoid any recurrences, there is insufficient probative evidence of sustainable \nmitigation in the record to make safe predictable judgments about Applicant\u2019s ability to \navert recurrent trust breaches in the future when tasked with responsibility for protecting \nsensitive and classified information. Taking into account all of the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding Applicant\u2019s pattern misuse of classified procedures and \nprocesses over the course of several years of documented infractions involving \nclassified information, he does not mitigate security concerns with respect to the \nallegations covered by SOR Guideline K, and M. \nI have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v.

Or. 10865, the Directive, and the AGs, to the facts and \ncircumstances in the context of the whole person, I conclude handling protected \ninformation and use of information technology security concerns are not mitigated. \nEligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nAgainst Applicant \n  AGAINST APPLICANT \n8 \n  GUIDELINE K (HANDLING PROTECTED INFORMATION): \n  Subparagraphs 1.a-1.e:  \n GUIDELINE M (USE OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY): \n\n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n               Subparagraph 2.a:                                                           \n \n \n \n \n        \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                         \n                                                               \n__________________________ \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \n1 There are other financial questions in the SF 86, but the SOR only alleged that Applicant falsified this \nquestion. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant has a history of financial problems and delinquent debts. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) \nand 19(c) are applicable. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.  \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems resulted from underemployment, unemployment, \nand medical issues when he was uninsured. The debts alleged in the SOR did not result \nfrom irresponsible spending. They are medical debts and an auto loan that he took out \nfor his mother, with the understanding that she would pay it. Applicant is not financially \nsophisticated. He took the avenue that many others would, and he sought help from \nprofessionals. He paid some debts, and the law firm disputed others. I note that his \nearlier credit reports contained no accounts other than the auto loan and the medical \ndebts, none of which are listed on his current credit report. He now has an auto loan. He \nis only an authorized user on a credit card. \nA security clearance adjudication is not a debt collection procedure. It is a \nprocedure designed to evaluate an applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. \nSee ISCR Case No. 09-02160 (App. Bd. Jun. 21, 2010). Applicant does not present a \nperfect case in mitigation. Delinquent debts are a continuing concern until they are \nresolved. However, at some point, debts become old, unenforceable, charged off, fall off \ncredit reports, and are no longer of interest even to the creditors. In essence, Applicant \nreceived a fresh start. I note that he has taken advantage of that fresh start, and he is \nmaintaining fiscal responsibility. I believe he will continue to do so. I find that Applicant\u2019s \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \ncurrent finances do not cast doubt about his judgment, reliability, trustworthiness, and \nability to protect classified information. Security concerns about his finances are \nmitigated. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct  \nThe security concern for personal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 15, as follows: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \nclearance investigative or adjudicative processes. \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a trustworthiness concern and may \nbe disqualifying. The following disqualifying condition is potentially applicable: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine national security \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities.  \nSOR \u00b6 2.a alleges that Applicant falsified the SF 86 when he failed to report the \ndebts alleged in the SOR under the following specific question: \nIn the past seven (7) years, [have] you had bills or debts turned over to a \ncollection agency? (Include financial obligations for which you were the \nsole debtor, as well as those for which you were a cosigner or guarantor). \nThere are other financial questions in the SF 86, but the SOR only alleged that \nApplicant falsified this question. To prove this allegation, the Government must prove by \nsubstantial evidence, among other things, that Applicant knew that he \u201chad bills or debts \nturned over to a collection agency.\u201d After considering all the evidence, including \nApplicant\u2019s age, education, experience, the nature of his debts, the adverse information \nhe reported under another question, and his credible testimony, there is insufficient \nevidence for a finding that Applicant intentionally falsified the question alleged in SOR \u00b6 \n2.b or any other questions on the SF 86. AG \u00b6 16(a) is not applicable. SOR \u00b6 2.b is \nconcluded for Applicant. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guidelines E and F in my whole-person analysis. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant \nmitigated the financial considerations security concerns and refuted the personal \nconduct security concerns.2 \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.u: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.a: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \nEdward W. Loughran \nAdministrative Judge \n2 The adjudicative guidelines give me the authority to grant conditional eligibility \u201cdespite the presence of \nissue information that can be partially but not completely mitigated, with the provision that additional \nsecurity measures shall be required to mitigate the issue(s).\u201d I have not done so as I have concluded the \nfinancial issues are completely mitigated, and it is unnecessary to further monitor Applicant\u2019s finances. \n7 \n",

(Item 4.) \nOn April 26, 2022, Applicant was interviewed by an investigator for the Office of \nPersonnel Management (OPM). She confirmed the accuracy of her e-QIP statements \nconcerning drug use, and added that she had been spending about $150 per month on \nmarijuana or THC vaping products until January 2022, and smoking several times each \nweek. She said that she stopped purchasing and using medical marijuana at that point \nsince she was unsure how it would affect her pending job application and national security \neligibility. She said she had purchased marijuana from licensed dispensaries after \nobtaining her Card in January 2021, and illegally obtained it from friends, acquaintances, \nor off the street before that. Once she started buying medical marijuana, her association \nand contact with many of those acquaintances became less frequent. (Item 5.) \nApplicant also said that her present employer is aware of her use of medical \nmarijuana since she tested positive on a February 2021 random drug test. She expressed \nto the OPM investigator that she would like to go back to using medical marijuana \nbecause it benefits her health greatly, but she would also like to secure her pending \nemployment with the Federal contractor. She said that if the employer prohibits medical \nmarijuana use even with her state-issued Card, then she would not be engaged with it \nany longer and would have to find alternatives to assist with her health concerns.

There \nis no indication that she was ever evaluated for, or diagnosed with, a substance use \ndisorder, or participated in a treatment program. I was unable to evaluate her credibility, \ndemeanor, or character in person, since she elected to have her case decided without a \nhearing. \nPolicies \nThe national security eligibility action was taken under Executive Order 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDoD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the National Security Adjudicative \nGuidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to \nHold a Sensitive Position (AG), which became effective within the DoD on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations \nfor each guideline, the AG list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating \nconditions, which are to be used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to \nclassified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere speculation or \nconjecture. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14 requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nA person applying for national security eligibility seeks to enter into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants national \nsecurity eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as \nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or sensitive information. \nFinally, as emphasized in Section 7 of Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination \nunder this order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information.) \nAnalysis \nGuideline H: Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nAG \u00b6 24 describes the security concerns related to this guideline: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" as \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in \nthis guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nAG \u00b6 25 sets out conditions that could raise security concerns and may be \ndisqualifying. Four are established in this case: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); \n(b) testing positive for an illegal drug; \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia; and \n(g) expressed intent to continue drug involvement and substance misuse, \nor failure to clearly and convincingly commit to discontinue such misuse. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant purchased and used marijuana and cannabis-derived THC products on \na regular basis from January 2010 until at least January 2022, and expressed her \nintention to continue doing so. She tested positive for marijuana on a random urinalysis \nconducted by her employer in February 2021. Her statement to the OPM investigator, \nthat she would stop using marijuana if she needed to for her potential job or to get a \nsecurity clearance, does not constitute a clear and convincing commitment to discontinue \nher long-term substance misuse. The evidence raised the above disqualifying conditions, \nthereby shifting the burden to Applicant to rebut, extenuate, or mitigate those concerns. \nAG \u00b6 26 lists three conditions that could mitigate security concerns raised under \nthis guideline: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; \nand \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility; and \n(d) satisfactory completion of a prescribed drug treatment program, \nincluding, but not limited to, rehabilitation and aftercare requirements, \nwithout recurrence of abuse, and a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified \nmedical professional. \nThe record evidence does not support mitigation under any of these conditions. \nApplicant\u2019s illegal drug use began when she was 17 years old, and continued on a regular \nbasis until at least January 2022. Her claimed intent to stop violating Federal drug laws, \nif her potential job warranted that, was tentatively expressed to the OPM investigator three \nmonths after her e-QIP declaration to the contrary. She has not changed her association \nwith the environment where her drug use occurred, and only partially reduced her \ncontacts with the friends and acquaintances involved. No mitigation under AG \u00b6\u00b6 26(a) \nor 26 (b) was established. Applicant has neither sought nor participated in any drug \ntreatment, rehabilitation, or aftercare program; and no medical professional supplied a \nfavorable prognosis. There is no evidence to establish mitigation under AG \u00b6 26(d). \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s national security eligibility by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct \nand all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for \na security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the applicable guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \npertinent facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant\u2019s lengthy pattern of \nillegally purchasing and using controlled substances leaves me with significant doubts as \nto her eligibility for a security clearance. Her statement to the OPM investigator that she \nwould stop using illegal drugs if she needed to for her job or to obtain a security clearance \nis neither convincing nor mitigating. Her regular violations of Federal and, until 2021, state \ncriminal laws for her personal benefit and enjoyment preclude a reasonable conclusion \nthat she could be relied upon to comply with security-related requirements for the \nprotection of classified and sensitive information that she might find to be inconvenient or \nburdensome. She did not meet her burden to mitigate the security concerns arising under \nthe guideline for drug involvement and substance misuse. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.c \nAgainst Applicant \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant access to classified \ninformation.

He \nwas married from June 1995 to June 2005. He has 19 year-old twins from that marriage; \nthey do not live with him.

(Item 2.) \nUnder Guideline F, the SOR alleged that Applicant (1) is indebted to the Internal \nRevenue Service for $3,352 for tax year 2014; and (2) failed to file state income tax \nreturns for tax years 2014 and 2015. (Item 1S.) He admitted those allegations. (Item 1A.) \nDuring Applicant\u2019s October and November 2021 personal subject interviews (PSI), \nhe discussed his financial matters. He identified seven accounts with nominal balances \nranging from $61 to $864 totaling $2,404. (Item 3.) Those accounts are not reported on \nhis January 3, 2023 credit report and are not alleged in the SOR. (Items 1S and 6.) \nApplicant also discussed three significant debts. The first was a child support debt \nfor $32,000. In May 2015 he began a court-approved payment plan and paid off that debt \nin February 2021. (Item 3.) That debt was not alleged in the SOR and was not reported \non the Government\u2019s credit reports. (Items 1S, 5 and 6.) \nThe second was a debt Applicant owed to the state department of revenue for \n$14,146 of taxes for tax years 2014 and 2015. In 2015, he started a payment plan. He \nwas on that plan as of his PSI. That debt was not alleged in the SOR and was not reported \non the Government\u2019s credit reports. (Items 1S, 5 and 6.) \nThe Government\u2019s interrogatories asked Applicant to provide state tax account \ntranscripts (or the equivalent) for years 2014 and 2015. He responded: \u201cI was told that \n[the state] does not issue Tax Account Transcripts at all. Only the IRS does. I requested \n[IRS] copies for the years in question (2014 & 2015) online.\u201d He attached IRS transcripts \nfor tax years 2014 and 2015. They shed no light on his state tax filings.

In \n2017, he changed jobs and did not have enough money to make his payments. The auto \nwas repossessed in July 2017 and sold, which left a balance due of $7,000. He began a \npayment plan on November 19, 2021, of $300 a week to pay the balance. (Item 3.) This \naccount was reported in collection on the Government\u2019s October 2021 credit report. (Item \n5.) It was not reported on the Government\u2019s January 3, 2023 credit report and was not \nalleged in the SOR. (Items 1S and 6.) \nApplicant\u2019s most recent credit report shows 10 accounts PAYS AS AGREED with \nzero past-due amounts and no tax delinquencies or tax liens. (Item 6.) His earlier credit \nreport does not show any tax delinquencies or tax liens. (Item 5.) Other than Applicant\u2019s \nadmissions to the two SOR allegations, there is no other record support for the SOR\u2019s \ntwo allegations. (Item 1A.) \nLaw and Policies \nIt is well established that no one has a right to a security clearance. As the \nSupreme Court held, \u201cthe clearly consistent standard indicates that security \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Department of the Navy \nv. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988). \nThe adjudicative guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. A2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for \naccess to classified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In \nreaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, \nand based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing \ninferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information.

Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. . . .  \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified \ninformation. ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nGuideline F notes conditions that could raise security concerns under AG \u00b6 19. \nThe following condition is the only one applicable in this case: \n(f)  failure to file . . . annual . . .  state . . . income tax returns . . . or failure \nto pay annual Federal . . . income tax as required. \nApplicant\u2019s unpaid federal income taxes and his failure to file state income tax \nreturns are established by the admissions in his Answer. AG \u00b619 (f) applies. The next \ninquiry is whether any mitigating conditions apply. \nGuideline F also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are \npotentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and  \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n         \n \n \n \n \n \n                   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements.  \nI considered mitigating condition AG \u00b6 20(a). Applicant\u2019s federal income tax \ndelinquency of $3,352 occurred in 2015 for tax year 2014, almost 10 years ago. This was \na one-time occurrence and has not recurred. In fact, other than his Answer to the SOR, \nthe Government submitted no evidence to support this allegation. In addition, the \nmagnitude of this delinquency does not raise any national security concerns. SOR \u00b6 1.a \nhas been mitigated under AG \u00b6 20(a). \nAccording to Applicant\u2019s PSI, he started a payment plan in 2015 to pay $14,146 of \nback state income taxes for tax years 2014 and 2015. He was still on that plan at the time \nof his PSI. I will take administrative notice that tax authorities customarily do not allow a \ndelinquent taxpayer to begin a payment plan, unless the taxpayer has first filed returns \nfor the tax years in question. Therefore, he must have filed his 2014 and 2015 returns in \norder to have embarked on a payment plan. SOR \u00b6 1.b has been mitigated under AG \u00b6 \n20(g). \nWhole Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(a), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. AG \u00b6\u00b6 2(a) and (d)(1)-(9) \n(explaining the \u201cwhole-person\u201d concept and factors). In my analysis above, I considered \nthe potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions and the whole-person concept in \nlight of all the facts and circumstances surrounding this case. \nApplicant leaves me with no questions about his eligibility and suitability for a \nsecurity clearance. Therefore, I conclude that Applicant has provided sufficient evidence \nto mitigate the security concerns arising under Guideline F, financial considerations. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a and 1.b: \nFor Applicant \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n_____________________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented, it is clearly consistent with the \ninterests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified \ninformation.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact In Applicant\u2019s SOR response, he denied the allegation in SOR \u00b6 1.b and admitted all remaining allegations in the SOR. His admissions are accepted as findings of fact. Additional findings follow. Applicant is a 54-year-old employee of a defense contractor seeking to obtain a security clearance. He has worked for his current employer since August 2019. He served on active duty in the United States Navy from 1987 to 2007. He retired at the rank of E-7 with an honorable discharge. He held a security clearance while serving on active duty for approximately 18 years. When he retired, he worked for a defense contractor until he was laid off in 2010. He was unemployed between December 2010 and August 2014. During this period, he was a full-time student attending college using his GI bill benefits. He graduated in 2014 with an associate degree. After graduating, he worked for several employers prior to his current position. He has been married since September 2012. He has two children from prior marriages and his wife has three children from prior marriages. The children are 17, 19, 22, 25 and 27. With the exception of the oldest child, all children live with them.

(SOR \u00b6 1.a) In April \n2022, he set up a payment plan with State A to resolve the taxes owed. He agreed to pay \n$50 a month. The first payment began on May 2, 2022. As of April 21, 2023, the balance \nowed was $1,816.28. He has an allotment set up to make monthly payments. He believes \nhe has six months remaining on the payment plan. He regrets not resolving this situation \nsooner. (Tr. 27-30; AE A)  \nApplicant disputes that he owes state income taxes to State B for tax year 2008. \n(SOR \u00b6 1.b) Applicant moved from State A to State B in late 2008. He started a new job \nlocated in State B in December 2008. When filing his 2008 income tax returns, he \nreceived tax assistance from a tax counselor at a local Army installation. (Local military \ninstallations often provide free tax service for uncomplicated income tax returns.) \nApplicant was advised by the tax counselor that he did not need to file state income tax \nreturns for State B because he worked in State B for less than one month and did not \nearn enough income in State B to warrant filing a state income tax return for 2008. (Tr. \n31-32) \nApproximately, five or six years later, State B contacted Applicant and told him that \nhe owes state income taxes for the entire year for 2008, even though he only worked in \nState B for one month. State B claims he owes them $7,000. Applicant admits he ignored \nthe tax issue involving State B because he did not have the money. He plans to dispute \nthe 2008 tax debt that State B claims he owes. He needs to get documentation from State \nA to show to State B that he worked and paid taxes to State A the majority of the year in \n2008. (Tr. 32-33) This is complicated by the fact that he did not timely pay the taxes owed \nto State A for tax year 2008 and is in the process of resolving the tax debt to State A \nbefore he can present evidence to resolve the tax issue with State B. \nAside from tax year 2008, Applicant timely files his state and federal income tax \nreturns each year. He has no other tax issues or liens. (Tr. 34) \nThe status of the remaining delinquent accounts are as follows: \nSOR \u00b6 1.c: $1,511 delinquent cell phone account placed for collection: Applicant \nadmits this debt but has made no arrangements to for pay this debt.

His wife \nearned approximately $32 per hour. He and his family were renting a home on a former \nmilitary base. The rent and expenses were much cheaper than living off base. The base \nclosed the family housing and he and his family had to move off base, which increased \nhis monthly expenses. His rent increased from $1,100 to $1,700. His priority was to put \nfood on the table and pay his bills. Taking care of family was more important to him. All \nof the children lived with them and they also took in a friend of his son who was kicked \nout of his house. He lived with them for eight to ten months. (Tr 40-43) \nApplicant\u2019s current expenses include rent: $2,600; car insurance: $1,000; car/gas \n$1,300; groceries: $300; and electric/water: $1,000. He has approximately $9,000 to \n$11,000 in his 401(k) account. Applicant currently earns $54,000 annually. His wife earns \n$60,000 annually. His children help with buying food. He estimates he receives between \n$700 and $1,000 a month from the children to help pay bills and food. They currently have \na young woman living with them who is the fianc\u00e9e of the young man they took in several \nyears prior. She will move out when they marry in December. She has lived with \nApplicant\u2019s family for one and half years and helps with utilities and food.

(AE B) \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The President \nhas authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicant\u2019s eligibility for \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Clearance \ndecisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \nThus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that it is based, in whole or \nin part, on any express or implied determination about applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or \npatriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the \nPresident, Secretary of Defense, and Director of National Intelligence have established \nfor issuing a clearance. \n5 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 \n(App. Bd. May 2, 1996). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of disproving a \nmitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 \n(App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, \non the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).  \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nAG \u00b6 18 expresses the security concern for financial considerations: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;   \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations: and \n6 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \nApplicant has a history of financial problems and delinquent debts. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) \nand 19(c) are applicable. AG \u00b6 19(f) applies regarding the tax debts owed to State A and \nState B. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. I have considered all of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 \nand the following potentially apply: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue; and  \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nAG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply. Aside from the payment plan for 2008 state income \ntaxes to State A, Applicant has not attempted to resolve any of the accounts alleged in \nthe SOR. He ignored his income tax situation from 2008 for more than a decade. As a \nresult, what should have been an easy problem to solve became more complicated. \nApplicant\u2019s failure to take steps to resolve his delinquent debts raise questions about his \nreliability, trustworthiness, and judgment. \n7 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFor several years, Applicant\u2019s income was lower. Around 2017, he was forced to \nmove his family from more affordable rental housing on a local military installation to rental \nhousing in the local economy. This resulted in increased expenses. Circumstances \nbeyond his control contributed to his financial issues. AG \u00b6 20(b) partially applies. \nHowever, it is given less weight because I cannot conclude Applicant acted responsibly \nunder the circumstances. He neglected to resolve his tax problems related to whether he \nowed State B for state income taxes for tax year 2008 for years. He has paid off some \ndebts that were not alleged in the SOR, but did not come up with a plan to settle the \nremaining delinquent debts. Aside from the state tax issues, the total amount of the debt \nis $4,396. He did not act responsibly under the circumstances. \nWhile Applicant testified that he has attended financial counseling, he admits he \nhad difficulty following a budget and a payment plan. While Applicant intends to pay his \ndebts, there is no clear indication that the problem is being resolved or under control. If \nApplicant meets with a financial counselor from a legitimate and credible source, such as \na non-profit counseling service, and follows their advice, he is capable of resolving his \ndelinquent accounts. AG \u00b6 20(c) does not apply. \nAG \u00b6 20(d) applies with respect to Applicant\u2019s payment plan for the 2008 income \ntax debt with State A. He is making timely payments by monthly allotment. He has not \ntaken steps to resolve the remaining debts so this mitigating factor is given less weight. \nAG \u00b6 20(e) does not apply. Applicant may have a legitimate dispute about filing \nand paying state income taxes in State B in 2008 because he only earned income in State \nB during the last month of the year. He was given bad advice and failed to file state \nincome tax returns in State B. He learned he owed state income taxes to State B several \nyears later. Instead of confronting the problem immediately, Applicant ignored the issue. \nThe issue remains unresolved at the close of the record. \nAG \u00b6 20(g) applies with respect to Applicant\u2019s state income tax debt owed to State \nA. He is making timely and regular payments towards the tax debt to State A. However, \nthe tax issue with State B remains unresolved.  \nThe DOHA Appeal Board has held that failure to comply with tax laws suggests \nthat an applicant has a problem with abiding by well-established government rules and \nsystems. Voluntary compliance with rules and systems is essential for protecting \nclassified information. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 16-01726 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 28, 2018). \nA person who fails repeatedly to fulfill his or her legal obligations, such as filing tax returns \nand paying taxes when due, does not demonstrate the high degree of good judgment and \nreliability required of those granted access to classified information. See, e.g., ISCR Case \nNo. 17-01382 at 4 (App. Bd. May 16, 2018). \nOverall, Applicant did not meet his burden of proof to mitigate the concerns raised \nunder financial considerations. \n8 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n     \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), \u201c[t]he ultimate determination\u201d of whether to grant a security \nclearance \u201cmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines\u201d and the whole-person concept. My comments under Guideline F are \nincorporated in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under those guidelines but some warrant additional comment. \nI considered Applicant\u2019s honorable service in the United States Navy as well as his \nfavorable employment with several DOD contractors. I considered the support he \nprovides to his wife and family. With some financial counseling and planning, Applicant \nhas sufficient financial resources to pay his delinquent debts and resolve the 2008 state \nincome tax situation. He did not take sufficient action before the hearing to resolve his \ndelinquent debts. \nThe security concerns raised under Financial Considerations are not mitigated. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a, 1.h, 1.i:   \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.b \u2013 1:g: \nAgainst Applicant \n9 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_________________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances in this case, it is not clearly consistent with the \ninterests of national security to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is a 40-year-old employee of a government contractor for whom he has worked since July 2018. He has been continuously employed by government contractors since June 2011. He has been married since August 2017. He and his wife have an 18-month-old child. He earned a high school diploma. He has held a security clearance since about 2006, without any security incidents. (Tr. 22-24, 30, 62; Answer; GE 1, 6; AE A) In the SOR, the Government alleged Applicant\u2019s failure to timely file his 2018 federal income tax return (SOR \u00b6 1.a), and his seven delinquent debts totaling approximately $117,000 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b through 1.h). The financial delinquencies consist of the following: federal income taxes (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.c); credit cards (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d, 1.e, 1.g, and 1.h); and a personal loan (SOR \u00b6 1.f). He admitted the SOR allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.d, and 1.f through 1.h, with additional comments. His admissions are adopted as findings of fact. He denied the remainder of the SOR allegations because he claimed to have resolved those debts prior to the issuance of the SOR. However, the SOR allegations are established through his admissions, the Government\u2019s credit reports, and Internal Revenue Service (IRS) tax records. (Answer; GE 1-6) While Applicant failed to timely file his federal income tax return for tax year 2018, he provided sufficient evidence that this failure was largely the fault of his CPA, with whom he has worked since 2009.

He has been continuously employed by government \ncontractors since June 2011. He has been married since August 2017. He and his wife \nhave an 18-month-old child. He earned a high school diploma. He has held a security \nclearance since about 2006, without any security incidents. (Tr. 22-24, 30, 62; Answer; \nGE 1, 6; AE A) \nIn the SOR, the Government alleged Applicant\u2019s failure to timely file his 2018 \nfederal income tax return (SOR \u00b6 1.a), and his seven delinquent debts totaling \napproximately $117,000 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b through 1.h). The financial delinquencies consist \nof the following: federal income taxes (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.c); credit cards (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d, \n1.e, 1.g, and 1.h); and a personal loan (SOR \u00b6 1.f). He admitted the SOR allegations in \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.d, and 1.f through 1.h, with additional comments. His admissions are \nadopted as findings of fact. He denied the remainder of the SOR allegations because he \nclaimed to have resolved those debts prior to the issuance of the SOR. However, the \nSOR allegations are established through his admissions, the Government\u2019s credit \nreports, and Internal Revenue Service (IRS) tax records. (Answer; GE 1-6) \nWhile Applicant failed to timely file his federal income tax return for tax year \n2018, he provided sufficient evidence that this failure was largely the fault of his CPA, \nwith whom he has worked since 2009. His CPA attempted to timely file the relevant \nincome tax return, but it was not accepted by the IRS. With the help of his CPA, he has \nlate filed this income tax return. The evidence shows that this failure to timely file his \nincome tax return was a one-off and not a recurring problem with him or his CPA. While \na failure to pay his federal income taxes for tax year 2018 is not alleged, he provided \nevidence that he paid those taxes. (Tr. 27-28, 32-33, 40-42; Answer; GE 1, 5, 6; AE D\u00ad\nG) \nIn October 2017, Applicant entered a payment arrangement with the IRS to pay \nhis delinquent taxes for tax year 2016. He satisfied these taxes on October 17, 2022. In \nDecember 2021, he entered a payment arrangement with the IRS to pay his delinquent \ntaxes for tax year 2020. The IRS acknowledged that he paid his delinquent taxes for tax \nyear 2020 on October 25, 2022. He refinanced the mortgage on his home and used the \nequity to finish paying those taxes. He no longer owes any federal taxes and received a \nrefund for tax year 2022. He also used the equity from his refinance to pay off $50,000 \nin non-delinquent credit-card debt that was not listed in the SOR. (Tr. 42-45, 58, 74-76, \n84; Answer; AE D, E, H, I) \nIn about March 2018, Applicant entered into an agreement with a debt \nconsolidation company (DCC) to get a grip on his finances and to settle his consumer \ndebts. He enrolled the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d through 1.h, as well as several other \nconsumer debts not listed in the SOR. He was current on all these accounts prior to \nhiring DCC but defaulted on them pursuant to his DCC agreement.

The DCC program was \ninitially scheduled to last three years, but because the COVID-19 pandemic slowed \nnegotiations with creditors, it has lasted longer. (Tr. 35-36, 39, 45-56, 76-80; Answer; \nGE 1-6; AE B, J, K) \nThrough the DCC program, Applicant has settled the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.e and is \ncurrently paying the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.h. DCC is still negotiating a settlement agreement \nwith the creditors of the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d, 1.f, and 1.g, and no payments have been \nmade on these accounts. He has settled four accounts that are not listed in the SOR. \nOverall, he has paid $87,000 towards his total enrolled debt of $154,000. He currently \npays about $1,460 per month into the DCC account, but that amount varies depending \nupon what debts are being paid at any given time. Applicant\u2019s plan is to continue his \nagreement with DCC until all the enrolled debts are paid. He also placed his home on \nthe market about three months prior to the hearing with the hope of using equity from \nthe sale to pay about $30,000 to DCC, at which point they will be required to settle his \nremaining enrolled debts with no further payment from him. He considers his hiring of \nDCC to represent financial counseling. (Tr. 35-36, 39, 45-56, 68, 76-84; Answer; GE 1-\n6; AE B, J, K)  \nApplicant\u2019s financial issues began in about 2010 when he took a hiatus from \nworking in Afghanistan, came back to the United States, and was voluntarily \nunemployed. During this time, he withdrew about $70,000 from a retirement account to \nmaintain the lifestyle he was living while he was employed. He did not withhold enough \nmoney for the taxes he incurred from these withdrawals. He also was not withholding \nenough money from his wages for income taxes, resulting in owing income tax at the \nend of several tax years. Judging from his receipt of an income tax refund in 2022, he \nhas fixed that issue. (Tr. 25-33, 58, 61-62; Answer; GE 1, 5, 6; AE A, E, J) \nApplicant failed to realize that a creditor stopped his automatic payments on one \nof his credit cards not alleged in the SOR for three months as emergency relief for \nHurricane Harvey in 2017. When he realized he had not made payments for several \nmonths, he could not afford to pay the balance and enrolled with DCC. He notified his \nfacility security officer that he had enrolled with DCC and listed his tax and other \ndelinquencies in his December 2020 Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations \nProcessing (SF 86). I observed Applicant while he testified and found him to be \ncredible. His willingness to report potentially derogatory information bolsters this finding. \n(Tr. 25-34, 62; Answer; GE 1, 5, 6; AE E, J) \nApplicant earns $138,000, annually in wages. His current monthly earnings are \nnearly subsumed by his monthly expenses. His current mortgage alone is $3,800 per \nmonth. He has about $5,000 in a checking account. He has depleted almost all his \nretirement savings with the exception of about $600. He is hopeful that he will get a \npromotion at work that will increase his salary to $145,000, annually. When he left his \njob in Afghanistan in 2010, he was making over $200,000, annually. He plans to sell his \nhome for at least the $550,000 appraisal amount and use the equity to pay more of his \ndebts and increase his budget surplus.

He and his wife have discussed the possibility of \ncanceling the contingency contract and purchasing a less expensive home.

(Tr. 38-40, 58-73, 82; GE 2, 6, 10) \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence.

The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \nAs evidenced by his income tax delinquency as early as 2016, and his other \nfinancial delinquencies and need to hire DCC beginning in 2018, Applicant has a history \nof being unable to pay his debts, including his federal income taxes. The above listed \nconditions are applicable, thereby shifting the burden to Applicant to provide evidence in \nmitigation. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nApplicant\u2019s failure to timely file his federal income tax return for the 2018 tax year \nwas a one-time occurrence arguably caused by his CPA that has since been remedied. \nI find that allegation mitigated under AG \u00b6 20(a), AG \u00b6 20(b), and AG \u00b6 20(g). \nWhile caused by his own errors that were not largely beyond his control, \nApplicant paid his delinquent federal taxes prior to the issuance of the SOR. He owes \nno federal taxes. He received an income tax refund for tax year 2022, so he appears to \nhave remedied the issue he had with not withholding sufficient taxes from his wages. I \nfind that his delinquent federal taxes are mitigated under AG \u00b6 20(d) and AG \u00b6 20(g). \nAll but one of the remaining SOR debts are unresolved. Applicant\u2019s income \nbarely exceeds his expenses. Despite paying off a significant amount of past-due debt, \nhe still has about $30,000 in non-delinquent credit-card debt. He entered into a \ncontingent contract to purchase a home that will significantly increase his debt. This \ncontract is contingent upon him selling his home and making more money, and he has \ntestified that he can (and might) cancel the contract unilaterally. I am hopeful that he \nmakes a fiscally responsible decision regarding this contract, however, given his current \nincome and expenses and outstanding delinquent debt, his financial problems are \nongoing. AG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply to his remaining SOR debts. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s remaining SOR debts were caused by spending beyond his means, \nnot properly monitoring his debts, and voluntarily defaulting as advised by DCC. These \ncauses were not largely beyond his control. AG \u00b6 20(b) does not apply to those debts. \nWhile DCC is assisting him with addressing his consumer debts by negotiating \nsettlements and distributing payments, he has provided insufficient evidence to show \nthat these services constitute \u201cfinancial counseling.\u201d AG \u00b6 20(c) does not apply to his \nremaining SOR debts. \nIn 2018, Applicant engaged DCC to assist him with resolving his consumer \ndelinquencies. For over five years, he has consistently made the required payments to \nDCC. While he has only resolved one of the consumer debts in the SOR through this \nprogram, he has resolved four other consumer debts not listed in the SOR. He has paid \nabout 60 percent of his remaining, delinquent debts. He credibly testified that he will \ncontinue to make the required payments until the remainder of his debts are resolved. \nHe is also attempting to sell his house to use the equity to make a lump-sum payment to \nDCC to insure that he meets their requirements to have the debts resolved with no \nrecurring payments. While DCC\u2019s progress has been slow, I do not find that fact \nsufficiently detracts from his ability to show that his effort is made in good faith. AG \u00b6 \n20(d) applies to the remaining SOR debts. \nA meaningful track record of debt reform includes evidence that debts have been \npaid off or resolved. An applicant is not required to show that every debt in the SOR has \nbeen paid, and there is no requirement that a plan provide for payments on all \noutstanding debts simultaneously. ISCR Case No. 14-00504 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, \n2014). Rather, an applicant is required to demonstrate that he or she has \u201cestablished a \nplan to resolve his [or her] financial problems and taken significant actions to implement \nthat plan.\u201d There is also no requirement that the first debts paid in furtherance of a \nreasonable debt plan are the SOR debts. ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2 (App. Bd. May \n21, 2008). Guideline F mitigation does not require the payment of all the SOR debts. \nInstead, it requires that Applicant remove trustworthiness and reliability concerns raised \nby those debts. ISCR Case No. 14-00504 at 3. \nApplicant\u2019s DCC arrangement, his refinancing of his mortgage to pay \nindebtedness, his viable plan to sell his home to pay indebtedness, and his viable plan \nto live rent and mortgage free to save money demonstrate that he has established a \nplan to resolve his financial problems and taken significant actions to implement that \nplan. While an affirmative commitment to cancel the contingency contract would have \nbeen preferable, his credible testimony that he may cancel it helps resolve any doubts \nabout his judgment, trustworthiness, and reliability. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge must consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance.

After reviewing the results of the \nensuing background investigation, adjudicators for the Department of Defense \nConsolidated Adjudications Facility (DOD CAF) could not determine, as required by \nExecutive Order 10865, as amended, and by DOD Directive 5220.6 (Directive), that it \nwas clearly consistent with the interests of national security for Applicant to have access \nto classified information. \n1 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nOn September 19, 2022, the DOD CAF sent Applicant a Statement of Reasons \n(SOR) alleging facts that raise security concerns addressed under Guideline B (Foreign \nInfluence).

As provided for by paragraph E3.1.7 of the Directive, Department Counsel for \nthe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a File of Relevant Material \n(FORM) that Applicant received on November 15, 2022. The FORM proffered four \nexhibits (Items 1 \u2013 4) on which the Government relies to support the SOR allegations. \nAttached to the FORM and its exhibits was an unmarked Request for \nAdministrative Notice, Republic of Iraq. I have included it in the record as Hearing Exhibit \n(HX) 1. It consists of a six-page memorandum and six supporting documents labeled I \nthrough VI. \nApplicant had 30 days from receipt of the FORM to object to any of the \nGovernment\u2019s exhibits or to provide other additional information. He timely responded to \nthe FORM and submitted information in support of his case. Department Counsel waived \nobjection to the admissibility of Applicant\u2019s response to the FORM (hereinafter \u201cRTF\u201d). \nApplicant did not otherwise comment on or object to the Government\u2019s exhibits. \nAccordingly, GX 1 \u2013 4, HX 1, and the RTF became part of the record, which closed on \nDecember 14, 2022. I received the case for decision on January 26, 2023. \nFindings of Fact \nUnder Guideline B, the SOR alleged that Applicant\u2019s parents (SOR 1.a) and two \nbrothers (SOR 1.b) are citizens and residents of Iraq. It also alleged that his sister is a \ncitizen and resident of Iraq who is employed by the Iraqi government (SOR 1.c).

(FORM, Item 2) In addition to the facts established by Applicant\u2019s \nadmissions, and based on my review of the information presented in the FORM, I make \nthe following findings of fact. \nApplicant is a 41-year-old employee of a federal contractor, for whom he has \nworked since July 2021. He was born and raised in Iraq, where he completed his college \neducation in June 2004. He and his wife, who also was born and raised in Iraq, were \nmarried in July 2006.

SOR 1.e alleges that his children are Iraqi citizens. \n(FORM, Item 3; RTF) \nApplicant became a naturalized U.S. citizen in July 2020. In his e-QIP, he did not \nprovide naturalization information about his wife and children. In response to the FORM, \nhe provided copies of their U.S. passports that were issued in August and September \n2020, respectively. The SOR alleges that Applicant\u2019s children are Iraqi citizens, \nsomething he acknowledged may still be the case; however, it also is clear that they and \ntheir parents are U.S. citizens who have been living together and continuously in the \nUnited States for over eight years. SOR 1.e is resolved for Applicant. (FORM, Items 3 \nand 4; RTF) \nBetween April 2007 and November 2014, Applicant worked for an Iraqi bank. \nStarting in 2008, he was vetted for work at the bank\u2019s branch inside the U.S. Embassy in \nBaghdad\u2019s Green Zone. Applicant disclosed in his e-QIP that he was investigated and \napproved for access to the embassy. He also provided copies of U.S. government-issued \nidentification cards he used for access to the Green Zone and the embassy itself. In June \n2011, the embassy\u2019s Senior Financial Management Officer provided a memorandum in \nwhich he roundly praised Applicant\u2019s work as a point of contact between his staff and the \nIraqi bank in the conduct of essential financial transactions and in working with Iraqi \nvendors in support of U.S. military requirements in Iraq. Applicant left his embassy \nposition (it appears he remained with the bank until 2014) that same month after the \ncontract between the bank and the U.S. Department of State was modified. When \nApplicant left the embassy, the U.S. Ambassador to Iraq presented him with a certificate \nof appreciation for his dedication to and support of the U.S. mission in Iraq. (FORM, Item \n3; RTF) \nApplicant immigrated to the United States on what Department Counsel termed \n\u201can unspecified visa\u201d and \u201creceived Government financial support for refugees.\u201d (FORM \nat 2-3.) In response to the FORM, Applicant stated that he \u201ccame to the U.S. through the \nIOM program due to my job as a contractor with the U.S. government.\u201d (RTF) The IOM \nprogram to which he referred is the International Organization for Migration \n(https://mena.iom.int/iraq), a non-governmental organization (NGO) whose mission is to \nassist persons who must relocate after being displaced by conflict. It is likely that Applicant \nreceived assistance from this NGO or from the U.S. government in expediting his \nimmigration to the United States. \nAfter he arrived in the United States, and after a three-month period of \nunemployment, Applicant started working in the computer and information technology (IT) \nindustry. From February 2015 to the present, he has been steadily employed in such jobs. \nIn addition to his full-time jobs, between May 2015 and February 2019, he supplemented \nhis income by working part-time in ridesharing jobs. In 2016, Applicant bought the house \nin the Unites States where he and his family still live. All of his personal, community, \nprofessional, and financial interests are in the neighborhood where he is raising his \nchildren.

His father is a retired government employee, and his mother has never \nworked outside the home. Applicant speaks with them as often as daily. His sister is an \nemployee of an Iraqi government agency. He speaks with her monthly or in person during \nvisits to see his parents (Applicant has traveled to Iraq in 2016 and 2021).  Applicant \naverred that his sister\u2019s work does not relate to any military, security, intelligence, or \nforeign relations interests by the Iraqi government. Applicant\u2019s brothers and his father-in-\nlaw, who is a physician, have no apparent connection to the Iraqi government. One \nbrother works for a trade association, the other a car dealer. The record does not reflect \nwhat level of contact Applicant has with his brothers or with his father-in-law, either directly \nor through his wife. Applicant averred that none of his relatives in Iraq know that he is \napplying for a security clearance. They only know that he works in the IT field. (FORM, \nItems 2 \u2013 4; RTF) \nPrior to his departure from Iraq in 2014, Applicant started building a new house for \nhis family; however, it was not completed until 2017. Applicant\u2019s parents moved into the \nhouse because theirs had been demolished, and they needed a place to live pending \ncompletion of construction of a new house. Applicant\u2019s parents and his brothers now live \nin the house. Applicant wants to bring his parents to live in the U.S. with him. To that end, \nhis house in Iraq is now on the market. Applicant does not receive rent for the house and \nthere is no indication in this record about its value. (FORM, Items 2 \u2013 4; RTF)  \nTo properly assess the security significance of these facts within the adjudicative \nguideline at issue, I have taken administrative notice of certain facts regarding Iraq as \npresented in HX 1. Iraq is a constitutional republic, and its most recent parliamentary \nelections in 2021 were assessed by European Union and United Nations observers to be \nfree and fair. Nonetheless, as to Iraq in general, concerns remain over the continued \ninability of that freely-elected government to quell the violence and instability that persist \nin some parts of that country. These conditions are fueled and perpetrated by terrorist \ngroups affiliated with Al-Qaeda and ISIS, as well as by Sunni insurgents and Iranian-\nbacked Shiite militias. As a result, some parts of Iraq, mainly in areas south of Baghdad, \nsuch as Basrah, remain wholly unstable. Even the city of Baghdad is still subject to \nrandom acts of terrorist violence. U.S. citizens and interests in Iraq remain at high risk for \nkidnapping and terrorist violence. The U.S. State Department has advised against all \nindividual travel to Iraq. The ability of the U.S. Embassy to provide consular services at \nthe U.S. consulate in Basrah is extremely limited given the security environment, while \nthe U.S. embassy in the IKR capital of Erbil remains open. While ISIS insurgent groups \nremain active in Iraq, their control over large swaths of Iraq has been diminished by U.S. \nand coalition efforts. Such groups regularly attack both Iraqi security forces and civilians. \nAnti-U.S. sectarian militias may also threaten U.S. citizens and western companies \nthroughout Iraq. U.S. Government and western interests remain possible targets for \nattacks. \nAdditionally, there are significant human-rights problems in Iraq. Widespread \ncorruption, as well as abuses by Iraqi security forces in response to acts of violence by \nterrorists and others, have undermined confidence in the Iraqi central government and its \njudiciary. Human-rights violations by Iraqi law enforcement are not uncommon and are \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nnot being addressed when identified. Those include killing, kidnapping, and extorting \ncivilians, as well as inhumane conditions in detention and prison facilities, arbitrary arrest \nand lengthy pretrial detainment, denial of fair public trial, limits on freedom of expression, \nfreedom of the press, censorship of religion, limits on peaceful assembly, and societal \nabuses of women. The various terrorist and militia organizations are also responsible for \nsignificant human rights abuses in Iraq. \nPolicies \nEach security clearance decision must be a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndetermination based on examination of all available relevant and material information, \nand consideration of the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in the adjudicative \nguidelines (AG). (See Directive, 6.3) Decisions must also reflect consideration of the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2(d). Commonly referred to as the \u201cwhole-person\u201d concept, those \nfactors are: \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nThe presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not \ndeterminative of a conclusion for or against an applicant. However, specific applicable \nguidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against them as they \nrepresent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to classified \ninformation. A security clearance decision is intended only to resolve whether it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest for an applicant to either receive or continue to have \naccess to classified information. (Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988)) \nThe Government bears the initial burden of producing admissible information on \nwhich it based the preliminary decision to deny or revoke a security clearance for an \napplicant. Additionally, the Government must be able to prove controverted facts alleged \nin the SOR. If the Government meets its burden, it then falls to the applicant to refute, \nextenuate or mitigate the Government\u2019s case. Because no one has a \u201cright\u201d to a security \nclearance, an applicant bears a heavy burden of persuasion. (See Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, \n531) A person who has access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship \nwith the Government based on trust and confidence. Thus, the Government has a \ncompelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgment, \nreliability and trustworthiness of one who will protect the national interests as his or her \nown. The \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any \nreasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the Government. \n(See Egan; AG \u00b6 2(b)) \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nForeign Influence \nThe security concern under this guideline is stated at AG \u00b6 6: \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they result \nin divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern if they \ncreate circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or induced \nto help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way \ninconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to pressure \nor coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign contacts and \ninterests should consider the country in which the foreign contact or interest \nis located, including, but not limited to, considerations such as whether it is \nknown to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or sensitive information or \nis associated with a risk of terrorism. \nAs to SOR 1.f, which alleges only that Applicant owns \u201cresidential property in Iraq,\u201d \nthe only possible Guideline B disqualifying condition pertinent to that allegation is at AG \n\u00b6 7(f): \nsubstantial business, financial, or property interests in a foreign country, or \nin any foreign owned or foreign-operated business that could subject the \nindividual to a heightened risk of foreign influence or exploitation or personal \nconflict of interest. (emphasis added) \nAvailable information does not support show any value associated with Applicant\u2019s \nproperty in Iraq, much that it is substantial. SOR 1.f is not established and is resolved for \nthe Applicant. \nNonetheless, available information shows that Applicant has close ties to citizens \nof Iraq residing in Iraq. It also shows that he continues to be in contact with those persons. \nOverall, the political and military situation in Iraq continues to present a heightened risk \nthat his relatives may be pressured or coerced by groups hostile to U.S. interests as a \nmeans of compromising Applicant\u2019s willingness and ability to protect sensitive U.S. \ninformation. The disqualifying condition at AG \u00b6 7(a) applies: \ncontact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business or \nprofessional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident \nin a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign \nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion. \nAdditionally, because Applicant\u2019s sister works for an agency within the Iraqi \ngovernment, the record supports application of AG \u00b6 7(b): \n6 \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the individual's \ndesire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing that \ninformation or technology. \nBy contrast, I have considered the following pertinent AG \u00b6 8 mitigating conditions: \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which \nthese persons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in \nthat country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a \nposition of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, \ngroup, organization, or government and the interests of the United States; \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual's sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest; and \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation. \nThe record does not support application of AG \u00b6\u00b6 8(a) and 8(c). Applicant\u2019s ties in \nIraq, a country that presents a heightened risk of coercion, are familial and presumed to \nbe close. Available information in support of that presumption includes frequent contact \nwith and a recent visit to Iraq to visit his parents. Nonetheless, balanced against the \nheightened risk presented by the state of affairs in Iraq is the information about Applicant\u2019s \nwork in support of U.S. interests in Iraq and his circumstances as a naturalized U.S. \ncitizen whose roots are wholly planted in the United States for most of the past ten years. \nThat information supports application of AG \u00b6 8(b) and is sufficient, on balance, to mitigate \nthe security concerns established under AG \u00b6 7. \nIn addition to my evaluation of the facts and my application of the appropriate \nadjudicative factors under Guideline B, I have reviewed the record before me in the \ncontext of the whole-person factors listed in AG \u00b6 2(d). Applicant was vetted as a trusted \nforeign national for work in the Green Zone and inside the U.S. embassy in Iraq. He \nestablished a record of trustworthiness and dedication in support of U.S. interests in a \nwar zone that shows he will resolve any conflict of interest generated from his foreign ties \nin favor of the United States. The record evidence as a whole supports a fair and \ncommonsense decision in favor of the Applicant. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                             \n \n \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by section \nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a and 1.f: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all available information, it is clearly consistent with the interests of \nnational security for Applicant to have access to classified information.

(SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.a-1.t). Her admissions are incorporated as findings of fact. After a review of the \npleadings and evidence, I make the following additional findings of fact. \nApplicant is a 47-year-old employee of a federal contractor. She has worked for \nthis employer since September 2020. She is an accounting technician. She has been \ncontinuously employed since 2006. She is a high school graduate. She married in 1995 \nand was divorced in 2009. She has no children. (Items 2-3) \nThe SOR alleged Applicant owed 20 delinquent debts totaling approximately \n$26,500. The debts were comprised of consumer debts, mostly delinquent credit cards. \nThe allegations are supported by credit reports from March 2022 and March 2023, her \nanswers to questions from a background investigator in April 2022, and admissions in \nher SOR answer. (Items 2-6) \nApplicant explained that she got into financial difficulties in 2004, when she \nseparated from her then husband and met a person who would become her girlfriend \nuntil approximately 2019 when the relationship ended. Applicant described her former \ngirlfriend as mentally abusive. In order to keep the girlfriend happy, Applicant applied for \nand received 20 credit cards, in her name, to pay for a lifestyle the girlfriend demanded, \nbut which Applicant could not afford. She also financed the girlfriend\u2019s expensive hobby \nof restoring cars. Applicant was the primary wage earner and paid all the bills in the \nrelationship. Her girlfriend worked as a parttime dog groomer. Applicant claims not to \nhave applied for or used any credit cards since 2017. (Item 6) \nApplicant admitted all the debts in her SOR answer. She also provided the \nfollowing explanations about her SOR debts: \u201cThis has been taken care of and no \nlonger on credit report,\u201d or \u201cWorking on this now.\u201d She provided documentation that she \npaid one payment of approximately $57 toward SOR \u00b6 1.t in March 2023. She claimed \nthat she has two payments left to make on this account. She failed to provide \ndocumentation showing that the remaining SOR debts were paid directly or through a \npayment plan. All the SOR debts were listed on her March 2022 credit report, but some \nof these debts were not listed on her March 2023 credit report. They may have aged off \nby this time, but there is no evidence that Applicant paid them. (Items 2, 4-5; AE A1-3) \nApplicant documented that she is current and making regular payments on a \ncredit card that does not appear to be an SOR debt. On this account she made two $10 \npayments in January 2023, on a balance of $428. She also made two $20 payments in \nFebruary 2023, on a balance of $419. She claims that she is currently financially stable \nand meeting all her monthly expenses. She did not provide any documentation to show \nher current financial position, such as a budget, earned wages, or bank account \ninformation. There is no evidence of financial counseling.

Instead, recognizing the complexities of \nhuman behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the \nadjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, \nimpartial and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a \nconscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d \nThe administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the \nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable trustworthiness \ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to sensitive information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard sensitive information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nsensitive information. \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nAG \u00b6 18 expresses the trustworthiness concern for financial considerations: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \ntrustworthiness concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, \nincluding espionage. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise trustworthiness concerns. \nI have considered all of them under AG \u00b6 19 and the following potentially apply: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant incurred 20 delinquent debts that remain unpaid. I find both of the \nabove disqualifying conditions are raised. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate trustworthiness \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. I have considered all the mitigating conditions \nunder AG \u00b6 20 and the following potentially apply: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \nNone of the above mitigating conditions fully apply. Applicant admitted that her \nfinancial problems were created because she attempted to please her then girlfriend. \nThis is not really a condition beyond her control, but rather a conscious choice she \nmade. Regardless, she failed to present evidence that she acted responsibly in \naddressing her delinquent debts. She presented no evidence of taking any action to \ncontact creditors, set up payment plans, or pay the debts, other than her recent partial \npayment of one SOR debt (SOR \u00b6 1.t). She did not present evidence to support a \ndispute of any of the debts. There is no evidence of financial counseling. She failed to \nestablish a track record of financial responsibility. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to sensitive information by considering the totality of the \napplicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should \nconsider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for \naccess to sensitive information must be an overall commonsense assessment based \nupon careful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nrelevant facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 \n2(d) were addressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \nI considered Applicant\u2019s relationship with a former girlfriend that caused her \nfinancial distress and her recent credit card payments. However, Applicant failed to \nproduce evidence of any significant action taken to address her delinquent debts. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for access to sensitive information. For all these \nreasons, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the financial considerations \ntrustworthiness concerns. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.t: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with national \nsecurity to grant Applicant eligibility for access to sensitive information.

(EVER) been charged with an offense \ninvolving alcohol,\u201d by answering \u201cNo.\u201d I find this to be a willful falsification of a relevant \nquestion about his alcohol use. \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines (AG) list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number \nof variables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must \nconsider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable \nand unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14, requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nA person applying for national security eligibility seeks to enter into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants national security eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or \nsensitive information. Finally, as emphasized in Section 7 of Executive Order 10865, \n\u201c[a]ny determination under this order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in \nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty \nof the applicant concerned.\u201d See also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing \nmultiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information.) \nAnalysis \nGuideline H: Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Drug Involvement and \nSubstance Misuse is set forth at AG \u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" \nas defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term \nadopted in this guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 25 contains seven conditions that could raise a security \nconcern and may be disqualifying. Two conditions are established: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); and \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia \nAppellant smoked marijuana over two decades, ending in June of 2022. His last \npurchase of marijuana was only 11 months ago. Therefore, AG \u00b6 25 (a) and (c) are \nestablished. \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 26 contains four conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns. Two conditions may be applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \nand \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts;  \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were \nused; and  \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all \ndrug involvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that \nany future involvement or misuse is grounds for revocation \nof national security eligibility. \nNone of these conditions apply. Applicant\u2019s long history of drug misuse is too \nrecent to find that it is not of present security significance. The Drug Involvement and \nSubstance Misuse guideline is found against Applicant. \nGuideline G: Alcohol Consumption \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Alcohol Consumption is set out \nin AG \u00b6 21: \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about \nan individual's reliability and trustworthiness. \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 22 contains seven conditions that could raise a security \nconcern and may be disqualifying. Two conditions may apply: \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under \nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or \nother incidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the individual's \nalcohol use or whether the individual has been diagnosed with alcohol use \ndisorder; and \n(c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired \njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed with alcohol \nuse disorder. \nApplicant has three alcohol-related incidents between April of 2002 and February \nof 2004. He continues to consume alcohol, to the point of intoxication, on a daily basis. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 23 contains four conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns. Two conditions may apply: \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, \nor judgment; and \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive alcohol \nuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas demonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified \nconsumption \nor \nabstinence \nin \naccordance \nwith \ntreatment \nrecommendations. \nNeither of these conditions apply. Applicant has a severe drinking problem. \nAlcohol Consumption is found against Applicant. \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 15: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. The following will normally result \nin an unfavorable national security eligibility determination, security \nclearance action, or cancellation of further processing for national security \neligibility: \n(a) refusal, or failure without reasonable cause, to undergo \nor cooperate with security processing, including but not \nlimited to meeting with a security investigator for subject \ninterview, completing security forms or releases, cooperation \nwith medical or psychological evaluation, or polygraph \nexamination, if authorized and required; and \n(b) refusal to provide full, frank, and truthful answers to \nlawful questions of investigators, security officials, or other \nofficial representatives in connection with a personnel \nsecurity or trustworthiness determination. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nBased on Applicant\u2019s deliberate falsification of his e-QIP, the following \ndisqualifying condition applies: \nAG \u00b6 16 (a): deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant \nfacts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history \nstatement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine \nemployment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine national \nsecurity eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \nApplicant admits his knowing and willful falsification of his November 2020 e-QIP. \nNone of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 17 apply. Personal Conduct is found \nagainst Applicant. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s national security eligibility by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national \nsecurity eligibility must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the applicable guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Overall, the record evidence leaves \nme with questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security \nclearance. For this reason, I conclude Applicant did not mitigate the security concerns \narising from his drug involvement and substance abuse, alcohol consumption, and \npersonal conduct. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_________________ \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a~1.c: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline G: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a~2.d: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 3, Guideline E: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 3.a~3.c: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility \nfor a security clearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact In Applicant\u2019s SOR response, he admitted all four allegations in SOR (\u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.d). The four defaulted student loans totaled $22,693.

Applicant is a 52-year-old employee of a defense contractor assigned to a U.S. Air Force (AF) base as a training - roles manager and hybrid site integrator. He has worked for a DOD contractor since March 2019, and in January 2022, he moved to another state and a new AF base to do essentially the same type of work. He served honorably in the U.S. Air Force from 1994 to 2018. He retired at the rank of master sergeant (E-7). His military specialty was surgical technician. He earned an associate degree, and during 2016 to 2018 he attended another university, but he did not graduate with a bachelor\u2019s degree. He has been married to his wife since 1993, and they have two adult children and a 14-year-old daughter. His wife is employed as a cosmetic sales representative.

Guideline F (financial considerations) security concerns are \nnot mitigated. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn December 12, 2022, the Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency \n(DCSA) Consolidated Adjudication Services (CAS) issued a SOR to Applicant under \nExecutive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \n(February 20, 1960); DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (Directive) (January 2, 1992), as amended; and Security \nExecutive Agent Directive 4, establishing in Appendix A the National Security Adjudicative \nGuidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to \nHold a Sensitive Position (AGs), effective June 8, 2017. \nThe SOR detailed reasons why the DCSA CAS did not find under the Directive \nthat it is clearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant or continue a \nsecurity clearance for Applicant and recommended referral to an administrative judge to \ndetermine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. \nSpecifically, the SOR set forth security concerns arising under Guideline F. Applicant \nprovided an undated response to the SOR, and he requested a hearing before an \nadministrative judge.

The hearing was \nheld as scheduled using the DOD Microsoft Teams video teleconference system. \nDuring the hearing, Department Counsel offered four documents, Government \nexhibits (GE) 1 through 4; Applicant did not offer any exhibits, but I labeled two \ndocuments, Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AE) A and B, that he had previously provided in \nresponse to a DOHA request in October 2022. All proffered exhibits were admitted into \nevidence without objection. I provided Applicant a blank Personal Financial Statement \n(PFS) immediately after the hearing concluded, and I held the record open for two weeks \nin the event either party wanted to supplement the record with that additional information. \nApplicant timely submitted four documents I labeled as AE C, D, E, and F, and I admitted \nall proffered exhibits into evidence without objection. On August 22, 2023, I received a \ncopy of the transcript. (Tr.) The record closed August 30, 2023. \nFindings of Fact \nIn Applicant\u2019s SOR response, he admitted all four allegations in SOR (\u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.d). \nThe four defaulted student loans totaled $22,693. His admissions are accepted as \nfindings of fact. \nApplicant is a 52-year-old employee of a defense contractor assigned to a U.S. Air \nForce (AF) base as a training - roles manager and hybrid site integrator. He has worked \nfor a DOD contractor since March 2019, and in January 2022, he moved to another state \nand a new AF base to do essentially the same type of work. He served honorably in the \nU.S. Air Force from 1994 to 2018. He retired at the rank of master sergeant (E-7). His \nmilitary specialty was surgical technician. He earned an associate degree, and during \n2016 to 2018 he attended another university, but he did not graduate with a bachelor\u2019s \ndegree. He has been married to his wife since 1993, and they have two adult children \nand a 14-year-old daughter. His wife is employed as a cosmetic sales representative. (Tr. \n18- 20, 23; GE 1) \nFinancial Considerations \nApplicant began to experience financial issues after retiring from the Air Force in \n2018. He admitted that he was not good with the transition and the deductions from his \npay, which ultimately caused adverse tax consequences. He has resolved all of his \ndelinquent federal tax issues, and he has setup a payment plan with the state tax board \nfor his delinquent 2021 taxes. He has made approximately eight monthly payments to the \nstate. All of their state and federal tax returns are filed. They have an extension until \nOctober 2023 to file their 2022 tax returns. (Tr. 20-23) \nWhile Applicant attended a university from 2016 to 2018, he told the finance office \nthat he wanted his GI Bill to pay for his tuition, and that he did not want to accrue any type \nof debt.

He contacted the Department of Veterans Affairs and the university to inquire \nabout this debt, and Applicant discovered he had signed paperwork to have any \noutstanding tuition that was not paid by the GI Bill to be covered by grants and/or student \nloans. (Tr. 23-32; SOR response; GE 2) \nAfter Applicant graduated from high school in 1988, he attended other colleges \nuntil 1992. He was fully aware that he had accumulated some student loan debt for those \nspecific years. Although he admitted that he did not owe much tuition for these earlier \nyears of college before enlisting in the military, he had not made any effort to satisfy these \ndelinquent student loans. He never initiated contact with the student loan creditor to \nrequest loan forbearance, loan deferment, consolidation, or loan rehabilitation, but he did \ntell the loan servicer that he was in the military. He stated that years ago he had received \nphone calls and letters requesting payment for these student loan debts. (Tr. 23-32; SOR \nresponse; GE 2) \nDuring Applicant\u2019s October 2021 background interview, he told the investigator that \nhe was currently living paycheck to paycheck. Once he got his income under control he \nintended to pay back all of his creditors, but his unpaid taxes were his first priority. He did \nnot disclose the delinquent student loans he accumulated right after high school under \nthe financial section of the 2021 SCA. The four student loans alleged in the SOR are the \ndebts he developed during 2016-2019 while he was still enlisted in the military. He and \nhis wife have completed the Dave Ramsey financial course on two separate occasions \nsince 2015. (Tr. 23-32; SOR response; GE 1, GE 2) \nIn September 2022, Applicant was contacted by a representative of DOHA and \nlearned that his security clearance was still in-process. Applicant was asked to provide \nupdated information to DOHA concerning the status of his defaulted student loans. The \nfirst time the Applicant ever contacted the student loan servicer regarding his delinquent \nstudent loans occurred in about October 2022. He made a phone call to determine how \nhe could get these loans out of default. He said he was able to get the loans rehabilitated \nwithout making payments, and his loans were placed with Nelnet. He was able to set up \na payment plan to begin in October 2023. He also submitted paperwork to have his \nstudent loans considered for debt forgiveness, but he has not yet received a response. \nHe admitted that over all these years he has never made a single payment on his \ndelinquent student loans. The record does not show that his student loans had been \nrehabilitated. (Tr. 33-34; SOR response, AE A, AE B) \nSOR \u00b6 1.a alleges a delinquent student loan with the U.S. Department of Education \nin the amount of $7,891.

This student loan debt relief \nreceived several extensions. In March 2020, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, the \nPresident directed the DoED to place federal student loans in forbearance. The federal \ngovernment repeatedly extended the student loan payment pause. The pause includes \nthe following relief measures for eligible loans: a suspension of loan payments; a 0% \ninterest rate; and stopped collections on defaulted loans. See Federal Student Aid (FSA) \nwebsite, https://studentaid.gov/announcements-events/covid-19. (HE 2) On February 25, \n2023, the FSA website said: \nThe student loan payment pause is extended until the U.S. Department of \nEducation is permitted to implement the debt relief program or the litigation \nis resolved. Payments will restart 60 days later. If the debt relief program \nhas not been implemented and the litigation has not been resolved by June \n30, 2023 \u2014 payments will resume 60 days after that. We will notify \nborrowers before payments restart.  \nIn August 2022, President Biden announced forgiveness of $10,000 or $20,000 of \nfederal student loan debt, and on November 11, 2022, the DoED said they would continue \nto seek forgiveness of student loans.

Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The President \nhas authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicant\u2019s eligibility for \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Clearance \ndecisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \nThus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that it is based, in whole or \nin part, on any express or implied determination about applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or \npatriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the \nPresident, Secretary of Defense, and Director of National Intelligence have established \nfor issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 \n(App. Bd. May 2, 1996). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \n5 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nfacts.

Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.    \nThe Appeal Board explained the scope and rationale for the financial \nconsiderations security concern in ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) \n(citation omitted) as follows: \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might \nknowingly compromise classified information in order to raise money in \nsatisfaction of his or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the \ntotality of an applicant\u2019s financial history and circumstances. The Judge \nmust consider pertinent evidence regarding the applicant\u2019s self-control, \njudgment, and other qualities essential to protecting the national secrets as \nwell as the vulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive \npresumes a nexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines \nand an applicant\u2019s security eligibility. \nAG \u00b6 19 includes disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern and \nmay be disqualifying in this case: \u201c(a) inability to satisfy debts\u201d; \u201c(b) unwillingness to satisfy \ndebts regardless of the ability to do so\u201d; and \u201c(c) a history of not meeting financial \nobligations.\u201d \nThe SOR alleges four delinquent student loans totaling approximately $22,693. \nThe record establishes the disqualifying conditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), 19(b), and 19(c), \nrequiring additional inquiry about the possible applicability of mitigating conditions. \nDiscussion of the disqualifying conditions is contained in the mitigation section. \n6 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe financial considerations mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are as follows: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nThe only delinquent debts Applicant have at this time are his four federal student \nloans totaling $22,693. He makes a six-figure income, and he has been continuously \nemployed since 2019. He was placed on notice when he filled out his SCA in February \n2021 that a security clearance holder\u2019s financial history was of security concern to the \ngovernment. In October 2021, he was confronted by the DOD authorized investigator \nabout his delinquent student loans. He answered interrogatories in October 2022, and he \nreceived his SOR in December 2022. He had plenty of opportunities to take responsible \naction to begin repaying or rehabilitating his delinquent loans. Applicant did not initiate \ncontact with the DoED until only after he had been contacted by DOHA in September \n2022 requesting that he provide updated information on his defaulted student loans. \nBased on the current PFS, Applicant\u2019s net (emphasis added) annual salary totals \nabout $129,192. Even with the student loan monthly payment included in the PFS, he \nhad a monthly net remainder of $5,111. Applicant\u2019s four delinquent federal student loans \nare currently deferred under the CARES Act. Although his student loans are currently in \na deferment status, it is important to note that he has not made any payments to this \ncreditor, which caused them to go in default before the CARES Act was enacted and \nwhile he was gainfully employed. Applicant stated that he intends to make student loan \npayments beginning in October 2023, but he has not established a steady track record of \npayments even though he certainly has the financial resources to do so. As of the date of \nthe hearing, he had never made a student loan payment willingly. The timing of his actions \nto address his defaulted student loans does not demonstrate he initiated a good-faith \neffort to repay these creditors until his security clearance was in peril. \nIt is well-established that the timing of debt payments is a relevant consideration \nfor a judge to deliberate whether an applicant has acted in a reasonable and responsible \n7 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n     \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nmanner in addressing financial problems. For example, to receive full credit under \nMitigating Condition 20(d), an applicant must initiate and adhere \u201cto a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.\u201d Directive, Encl. 2, App. A \u00b6 20(d). \nApplicant\u2019s recent actions to resolve his delinquent student loans only after he learned \nhis security clearance was in peril do not receive this mitigating credit. \nNone of the mitigating factors apply. I find that repaying student loan creditors has \nnot been a priority for Applicant, especially when taking into account his annual income \nand his monthly net remainder of over $5,000 after paying his monthly expenses. In the \ncontext of his security eligibility, I find that Applicant did not act responsibly by failing to \naddress his delinquent student loans earlier. Applicant\u2019s actions under these \ncircumstances continue to cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good \njudgment. Guideline F security concerns have not been mitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), \u201c[t]he ultimate determination\u201d of whether to grant a security \nclearance \u201cmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines\u201d and the whole-person concept. My comments under Guideline F are \nincorporated in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under those guidelines but some warrant additional comment. I considered his \nage, length of employment, honorable military service, and his recent actions to \nrehabilitate his student loan and set-up a payment plan, which although occurred rather \nlate at this juncture, it is still a step in the right direction. \nIt is well settled that once a concern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s security \nclearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption against granting a security clearance. \nSee Dorfmont, 913 F. 2d at 1401. \u201c[A] favorable clearance decision means that the record \ndiscloses no basis for doubt about an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation.\u201d ISCR Case No. 18-02085 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan. 3, 2020) (citing ISCR Case \nNo.12-00270 at 3 (App. Bd.

Even before 2021, Applicant has shown little voluntary effort to \naddress his older defaulted student loans. Considering the lack of evidence of good-faith \nefforts to responsibly resolve these accounts, his financial history raises unmitigated \nquestions about his reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information. \nThis decision should not be construed as a determination that Applicant cannot or \nwill not attain the state of reform necessary for award of a security clearance in the future. \nWith more effort towards establishing a track record of financial responsibility, and a better \nrecord of behavior consistent with his obligations, he may well be able to demonstrate \npersuasive evidence of his security clearance worthiness. \nI have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Egan, Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, \nthe AGs, and the Appeal Board\u2019s jurisprudence to the facts and circumstances in the \ncontext of the whole person. Applicant failed to mitigate financial considerations security \nconcerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.d: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances in this case, it is not clearly consistent with the \ninterests of national security to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nPamela C. Benson \nAdministrative Judge \n9 \n",

He has held a security \nclearance since 2016. (Tr. 22-24, 34, 37, 47; GE 1) \nThe SOR alleged Applicant used marijuana from about 2008 to about 2013, and \nfrom about September 2020 to at least December 2021; and that he used marijuana \nfrom about September 2020 to least December 2021, while granted access to classified \ninformation.

(GE 1-3; SOR answer) \nApplicant started using marijuana in 2008 when he was 17 or 18 years old. He \nused marijuana approximately 400 times between 2008 and 2013. Use of marijuana \nwas illegal under state law where Applicant resided until 2012. He claimed to have \nstopped using marijuana in 2013 because it no longer fit his lifestyle. He began working \nfor his current employer in 2014 and shortly thereafter completed his first SCA. He \nadmitted his earlier use of marijuana in his 2014 SCA. He was granted a security \nclearance in 2016. He worked on a classified project from 2016 through approximately \n2020, when he no longer worked on that project. He claimed that he did not use \nmarijuana during this time period. He was advised by his work supervisor not to start \nusing marijuana now that he was no longer working on a classified project. (Tr. 24-25, \n31-32, 35-36, 41, 57; GE 2) \nApplicant resumed using marijuana in approximately September 2020. He \ncontinued his use through approximately December 2021. He testified that he used \nmarijuana one to three times a week. He used marijuana with his then-girlfriend, with \nwhom he no longer associates.

He was required to fill out another SCA in May 2021 \nand undergo a background interview in June and July 2021. He admitted using \nmarijuana after undergoing these security clearance activities. (Tr. 25-26, 33, 38-39, 42, \n44, 47, 49; GE 2) \nIn his SOR answer, Applicant asserted that he would not use marijuana in the \nfuture. He denied that he was dependent on marijuana. He offered evidence that on four \noccasions between October 2022 and February 2023, he provided urine samples that \ntested negative for Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the active ingredient in marijuana. He \nbegan seeing a therapist in June 2022. He sees her weekly. She testified that they have \nworked on how Applicant can better cope with anxiety and stress. She uses Cognitive \nBehavior Therapy as a tool to address these topics and to decrease his desire to use \nmarijuana. She has seen improvements in him. Applicant also presented a self-\nadministrated form for alcohol or drug abuse. While the assessment put Applicant at the \nrisk level of \u201cNone to Low,\u201d I gave little weight to this assessment because all the \ninformation is provided by Applicant in response to \u201cyes and no\u201d questions. (Tr. 27, 30, \n42-43, 50, 61-66; AE A-B) \nApplicant\u2019s former supervisor, who worked with him on a classified project from \n2016 to 2020, testified for him and offered a written statement of support. He stated that \nApplicant is an excellent engineer and is a trustworthy person. He is the supervisor who \nwarned Applicant not to use marijuana after concluding his work on the classified \nproject in 2020. He is also aware of Applicant\u2019s marijuana use after 2020 but believes \nhe has learned from the experience and recommends him for a clearance. Applicant \npresented several years\u2019 worth of performance appraisals where he was rated as \n\u201cexceeded or significantly exceeded\u201d expectations.\u201d (Tr. 52-57; AE C-D) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG 2(a), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. \nUnder Directive section E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to \nestablish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive section E3.1.15, an \n\u201capplicant is responsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, \nextenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, \nand has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Abuse \nAG \u00b6 24 expresses the security concern pertaining to drug involvement: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" \nas defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term \nadopted in this guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nAG \u00b6 25 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. Those that are potentially applicable in this case include: \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(a) any substance misuse; and \n(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or \nholding a sensitive position. \nApplicant used marijuana at various times between 2008 and 2013, and at \nvarious times from September 2020 to December 2021. AG \u00b6 25(a) applies. \nApplicant was granted a security clearance in 2016, but he clarified in his \ntestimony that he did not have access to classified information when he used marijuana \nexcept from November 2021 to December 2021. Eligibility for access to classified \ninformation and the granting of access to classified information are not synonymous \nconcepts. They are separate determinations. The issuance of a security clearance is a \ndetermination that an individual is eligible for access to classified national security \ninformation up to a certain level. Security clearance eligibility alone does not grant an \nindividual access to classified materials. In order to gain access to specific classified \nmaterials, an individual must have not only eligibility (i.e., a security clearance), but also \nmust have signed a nondisclosure agreement and have a \u201cneed to know.\u201d See ISCR \nCase No. 20-03111 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 10, 2022). AG \u00b6 25(f) applies to the period of \nNovember 2021 to December 2021. \nAG \u00b6 26 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. Two \npotentially apply in this case: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \nand \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; \nand \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility. \nApplicant\u2019s intermittent use of marijuana, which goes back to 2008, with \nnumerous uses after he held a security clearance, casts doubt on his current reliability, \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ntrustworthiness, and good judgment. His most recent use came after he completed his \nsecond SCA and background investigation, after his supervisor specifically warned him \nnot to use marijuana, and with full knowledge of his employer\u2019s prohibition against the \nuse of illegal drugs, including marijuana. He discontinued his association with his ex-\ngirlfriend with whom he used marijuana, and he expressed his intent not to use \nmarijuana in the future. However, he failed to establish a sufficient period of abstinence \nconsidering his history of resuming marijuana use after an extensive period of \nabstinence (2013 to 2020). None of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 26 fully apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nUnder AG 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guideline and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I considered Applicant\u2019s years of \ncontractor employment, his supervisor\u2019s recommendation, his therapist\u2019s testimony, and \nhis excellent employment record. However, I also considered that he used marijuana \nmultiple times, and as recently as December 2021, while holding a security clearance \neven though he knew such behavior was incompatible with holding a security clearance. \nHis frequent and recent marijuana use, while holding a security clearance, \ndemonstrates that he does not possess the reliability, trustworthiness, and good \njudgment to hold a security clearance. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns arising under Guideline H, \ndrug involvement. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nSubparagraph 1.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nAgainst Applicant (substituting \nNovember 2021 for September \n2021) \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance.

His first sergeant ordered Applicant to take a \nbreathalyzer test, which showed a blood alcohol content of .08 ml. Applicant later \nadmitted to his treating doctor that he drank a gallon of rum, followed by another fifth of \na gallon of rum over the weekend before his Monday duty day. Based upon Applicant\u2019s, \nblood alcohol content, his commander punished him under Article 15 of the UCMJ for \nbeing drunk on duty. He pleaded guilty and was sentenced to restriction and extra \nduties for 45 days and a reduction in grade from E-5 to E-4.

(GE 5) \nApplicant attended all his group sessions and did all his required homework. He \ndeclined an offer to have any medications prescribed for alcohol management. His \ndischarge diagnosis was: alcohol use disorder, severe, continuous, with withdrawal, \nuncomplicated. (GE 5) \nOutpatient Alcohol Treatment From March 2019 to October 2019 Through the \nArmy\u2019s SUDCC program. \nApplicant was placed in the Army\u2019s SUDCC outpatient program upon completion \nof his inpatient program. He began this program in March or April 2019. Applicant \ndescribed the program as him attending group counseling sessions two times a week, \nalcohol testing once a week, and individual counseling once a month. He was required \nto abstain from alcohol in order to successfully complete the program. His counselor \nwas a licensed mental health counselor (LMHC). According to Applicant\u2019s treatment \nrecords he was diagnosed with alcohol use disorder, severe. The records also indicated \nthat Applicant admitted using alcohol on several occasions while in the program. He \nused alcohol on April 26, 2019. He admitted this use in a group session. He admitted \nusing alcohol again on June 8, 2019, during a group session. In approximately July \n2019, Applicant reported to his dietician that he was consuming a pint of liquor every \nworkday and even more on the weekends. Records also show that he reported \nconsuming alcohol in June and July 2019. (Tr. 35-37;GE 6-9, 12-13) \nMedical Treatment in July 2019 in a Hospital Emergency Room After Drinking at \nLeast Two 750 ml. bottles of alcohol over two days; and \nDischarge from the Army for Alcohol Rehabilitation Failure in October 2019. \nOn  September 24, 2019, Applicant\u2019s father passed away due to complications \nfrom alcohol abuse. In his SOR answer, he stated that the day following the news about\nhis father, he had less than one drink while alone in his barracks room on an off-duty\nweekend. In his hearing testimony, he stated he bought a pint of rum and drank about\nhalf of it before his first sergeant showed up at his room. His first sergeant suspected\nthat he had been drinking alcohol and took him to the hospital to have his blood drawn.\nApplicant acknowledged that event, but denied being intoxicated and to the contrary\naverred that his first sergeant was intoxicated. There is no information in the record\nconcerning the result of this blood test or the amount of alcohol consumed. Applicant\nwas discharged from the Army less than a month later. The basis for his discharge, as\nnoted on his discharge certificate (DD-214) was Army Regulation (AR) 635-200,\nChapter 9, which is titled \u201cAlcohol or Other Drug Rehabilitation Failure.\u201d (Tr. 37-39, 41-\n42; SOR Answer, See AE B; GE 2, pp. 6-7) \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant Continues to Consume Alcohol Against Treatment Advice and \nRecommendations. \nDuring Applicant\u2019s background interview with an investigator, in November 2020, \nhe stated he no longer drinks alcohol. In his answers to DOHA interrogatories in July \n2021, he stated he drinks two beers weekly, with his last consumption being on July 16, \n2021. He further stated he did not intend to continue that rate of consumption. He also \nindicated that he becomes intoxicated when drinking three beers. The last time he was \nintoxicated was December 2019. He also answered that he never consumed alcoholic \nbeverages before going to work, failing to list the February 2019 incident when he was \ncharged with being drunk on duty and which led to his inpatient alcohol treatment. (GE \n2, p. 7; GE 3, pp. 3-4) \nBefore Applicant was disqualified from the SUDCC program, it was \nrecommended that he continue group counseling and forego use of any alcohol \n(substance). His discharge treatment plan included as an objective, \u201cabstain from \nalcohol.\u201d (GE 8, p. 5; GE 11, p.5; GE 12, p.5) \nApplicant currently drinks alcohol on his nonwork days and he also abstains from \nalcohol the day before his first work day of the week. He drinks approximately four to \nfive vodka drinks per occasion. He claims to only drink at home, never out in public. He \nclaims he does not drink to intoxication, but the last time he was intoxicated was in \nDecember 2022, when he was at a friend\u2019s house celebrating their birthdays, which fall \non the same day. He claims he had no alcohol incidents before the Army and none after \nhis discharge from the Army. He claims that alcohol is not important to his life. He has \nnot seen a counselor about his alcohol use since he left the Army in October 2019. He \nhas not attended any Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) meetings since leaving the Army. \nApplicant stated that alcohol has no meaning in his life, but he also stated that he \nenjoys drinking alcohol because it takes the edge off of things. He submitted a written \nletter of intent to \u201ccontinue my modification of alcohol consumption.\u201d He also stated that \nif he chooses to drink alcohol, he will do it in a responsible manner. He owns his own \nhome where he is the sole occupant. (Tr. 45, 47-49, 69, 71, 73-74; SOR answer, See \nAE D) \nAfter considering all of Applicant\u2019s prior statements during his inpatient and \noutpatient treatment, as well as his statement to his background investigator, there are \nsignificant inconsistency between those statements and his hearing testimony. Overall, I \ndid not find his testimony credible. \nCharacter and Possible Mitigation Evidence. \nApplicant presented eight character letters from supervisors, colleagues and \nfriends. They describe Applicant as responsible and someone who is dedicated, hard-\nworking, trustworthy, and who has high character. Several recommend continuation of \nhis security clearance.

(SOR \nanswer, See AE A, E-F) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(a), the entire process is a careful weighing of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest \nand shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d \nSee also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified \nor sensitive information). \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption \nAG \u00b6 21 expresses the security concern pertaining to alcohol consumption: \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about \nan individual's reliability and trustworthiness. \nAG \u00b6 22 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(b) alcohol-related incidents at work, such as reporting for work or duty in \nan intoxicated or impaired condition, drinking on the job, or jeopardizing \nthe welfare and safety of others, regardless of whether the individual is \ndiagnosed with alcohol use disorder; \n(c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired \njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed with alcohol \nuse disorder;   \n(d) diagnosis by a duly qualified medical or mental health professional \n(e.g., physician, clinical psychologist, psychiatrist, or licensed clinical \nsocial worker) of alcohol use disorder; \n(e) the failure to follow treatment advice once diagnosed; and \n(f) alcohol consumption, which is not in accordance with treatment \nrecommendations, after a diagnosis of alcohol use disorder. \nApplicant\u2019s excessive drinking while in the Army, which resulted in disciplinary \naction for being drunk on duty, his participation in both inpatient and outpatient alcohol \ntreatment programs, and his failure to successfully complete his outpatient program, led \nto his discharge from the Army. Additionally, he was diagnosed by qualified medical \nprofessionals with alcohol use disorder and he failed to follow treatment advice and \nrecommendations. The described record evidence supports the application of the above \ndisqualifying conditions, except as they relate to SOR \u00b6 1.a. Participation in alcohol \ntreatment as alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a does not establish a disqualifying condition. \nAdditionally, there was no evidence of the specific amount consumed by Applicant as \nalleged in SOR \u00b6 1.e, and the evidence indicated this event occurred in September \n2019, not July 2019, as alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.e. For these reason, I conclude SOR \u00b6 1.e is \nmaterially defective and find in favor of Applicant on that allegation. Having said that, \nthe evidence does establish that Applicant consumed some amount of alcohol in \napproximately September 2019. This was his final alcohol-related action that culminated \nin his discharge from the Army for failure to complete his alcohol treatment program. I \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nwill use this evidence as it may relate to credibility, mitigation, and the whole-person \nfactors. \nI have also considered all the mitigating conditions for alcohol consumption under \nAG \u00b6 23 and found the following relevant: \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, \nor judgment;  \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive alcohol \nuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of modified consumption or abstinence in \naccordance with treatment recommendations; and  \n(d) the individual has successfully completed a treatment program along \nwith any required aftercare, and has demonstrated a clear and established \npattern of modified consumption or abstinence in accordance with \ntreatment recommendations. \nApplicant\u2019s last adverse alcohol incident occurred in 2019. This might be \nconsidered attenuated by time, but he continues to consume alcohol on a regular basis, \nwhich is contrary to his treatment recommendations. He claims he has modified his \ndrinking pattern, however, his history of excessive drinking and his lack of credibility \nwhen describing his drinking patterns cause me to question the veracity of his claim. His \nactions cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. AG \u00b6 \n23(a) does not apply. \nApplicant claims that he will drink alcohol responsibly in the future. His past \nhistory indicates otherwise. His treating physician during his inpatient treatment noted \nApplicant\u2019s \u201cquestionable commitment to sobriety.\u201d He failed to complete his outpatient \ntreatment because he continued to consume alcohol. Since he left the Army, he has not \nsought counseling for his alcohol use, or attended any AA meetings. AG \u00b6\u00b6 23(b) and \n23(d) do not apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I considered Applicant\u2019s military \nservice, his contractor service, his letters of recommendation, and his appraisals and \ncertifications. \nOverall the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns under Guideline G, alcohol \nconsumption. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline G: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.b-1.d, 1.f-1.g: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.a, 1.e \n: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

On April 26, 2023, Department Counsel submitted the \nGovernment\u2019s file of relevant material (FORM), including documents identified as Items 1 \nthrough 7. DOHA sent the FORM to Applicant on April 28, 2023, who received the FORM \non May 11, 2023. She was afforded 30 days after receiving the FORM to file objections \nand submit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation. Applicant did not respond to \nthe FORM. The SOR and the Answer (Items 1 and 2, respectively) are the pleadings in \nthe case. Items 3 through 7 are admitted without objection. The case was assigned to me \non September 28, 2023. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is 66 years old, was married in May 1975 and divorced in October 1989. \nShe has two adult sons. She was married briefly in February 1996, but that was annulled \nin May 1997. From September 1991 to April 1998, she attended college but did not earn \na degree. From October 1997 to March 2006, she worked for a defense contractor. Since \nMarch 2006, she has worked for another defense contractor. She reported no periods of \nunemployment. She has owned her home since June 1997. (Item 3.) \nUnder Guideline F, the SOR alleged seven delinquent debts totaling $39,944. \n(SOR.) Each SOR debt is supported by the credit reports of record, showing those \naccounts being charged off or in collections. (Items 4 through 6.) They are also supported \nby the March 7, 2022 personal subject interview (PSI). (Item 7.) \nThe Answer \nBefore addressing each SOR debt, Applicant stated: \u201cI do not recall all of the \naccounts noted below but do acknowledge I fell behind on some credit card payments \ndue to the loss of relationship in which we shared expenses and found I could not maintain \nall of my payments.\u201d She gave no basic details about when that loss occurred. (Answer.) \nApplicant admitted SOR \u00b6 1.a ($6,709), claiming she has requested proof of \nindebtedness and \u201cwill proceed accordingly when the documentation is received.\u201d Her \nresponse cited a March 6, 2023 letter from creditor\u2019s counsel requesting a resolution \nagreement. (Answer.) She did not provide documents evidencing her request for proof of \nindebtedness or a copy of the March 6, 2023 letter she referenced. \nApplicant admitted SOR \u00b6 1.c ($9,551), claiming this debt is now paid due to wage \ngarnishment from August 2022 through March 10, 2023. (Answer.) The most current \ncredit report in the record is April 26, 2023, which may have been too recent to capture a \nsatisfaction through garnishment. That credit report does not show this debt. (Item 4.) \nShe provided no documents evidencing a garnishment or a satisfaction of this debt. \nApplicant denied the remaining five SOR debts. Those denials have the following \ncommon themes.

She provided no documents evidencing her attempts to \nobtain information from her creditors or collection agencies about her overdue accounts, \nor their responses \nThe PSI \nDuring Applicant\u2019s March 7, 2022 PSI, she discussed her SOR debts. (Item 7 at 2-\n5.) SOR \u00b6 1.a is a credit card account she opened in September 2015. She did not charge \nanything on that card until October 2016, when she used it for a vacation. She made \nregular monthly payments. It became delinquent in about June 2020, when she became \nunable to make minimum monthly payments. She does not dispute the information in the \ncredit report. She plans to contact the creditor and try to negotiate a monthly payment \nplan when she is able to do so .(Item 7 at 2.) \nApplicant discussed the circumstances that caused her financial problems. Her \nfinancial situation began to change, after a storm inflicted significant damage to her home \nin 2016. Only a part of the damage was covered by her homeowner\u2019s insurance. She had \nto pay about $12,000 to replace a leaking roof; $3,000 for replacing interior carpeting; \nreplacing and painting a deck; and updating appliances. She had to use credit cards to \npay her bills. Initially, she managed to juggle her finances to stay afloat, but over time, \nher financial situation became worse. (Item 7 at 2.) \nApplicant discussed her plans to resolve her financial problems. She is already in \nthe process of putting her home on the market, and she expected it to be listed by April \n2022. After the home is sold, she plans to move in with her daughter. (Note: There is no \nreference in the record to her having a daughter.) She currently owes $43,000 on her \nmortgage. An online estimate of the value of her home was $140,000. The balance on \nher auto loan is $1,000, which will be paid off in six months. She will use the profit from \nthe sale of her home to pay off her delinquent debts. (Item 7 at 2.) \nApplicant discussed the other six SOR debts, SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b through 1.g. These \naccounts are all credit cards. Her discussions of those accounts shared certain features. \nFirst, she does not dispute any of the information in the credit reports, even though she \ncould not recall details of many of the accounts. Second, the delinquencies occurred in \nabout the 2016 to 2020 timeframe. Third, the accounts became delinquent when she \ncould no longer make the minimum monthly payments. Fourth, she plans to contact the \ncreditors to attempt to negotiate monthly payment plans. Some of those plans may have \nto wait until she has sold her home. She did not provide any documents about the seven \ndelinquent accounts. (Item 7 at 2-5.) \nIn a follow-up PSI, Applicant discussed her current financial situation. Her gross \nmonthly income is $6,651, with total payroll deductions of $2,049, leaving a monthly net \nsalary of $4,602. Her basic monthly expenses are $2,430 (food, clothing, utilities, car, \netc.). Her monthly debt payments (including mortgage of $580) total $1,435. Her monthly \nnet remainder is $737.

Her total assets are $139,700. \nLaw and Policies \nIt is well established that no one has a right to a security clearance. As the \nSupreme Court held, \u201cthe clearly consistent standard indicates that security \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Department of the Navy \nv. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988). \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, an \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are \nflexible rules of law that apply together with common sense and the general factors of the \nwhole-person concept. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 \n\u00b62(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national \nsecurity eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \n Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, then the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel . . . .\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion in seeking a favorable security decision.  \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nany questionable acts to generate funds. . . . \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n        \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe guideline notes conditions that could raise security concerns under AG \u00b6 19. \nThe following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.  \nApplicant\u2019s SOR debts are established by her admissions and the Government\u2019s \ncredit reports. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and (c) apply. \nAG \u00b6 20 includes the following conditions that could mitigate security concerns \narising from financial difficulties: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nI have considered mitigating condition AG \u00b6 20(a). In her Answer, Applicant refers \nto \u201cthe loss of a relationship\u201d where she shared expenses but could not maintain her \npayments when that relationship ended. That event is not mentioned any further in her \nAnswer, the PSI, or anywhere else in the record. More credibly, it seems that her financial \nwoes stemmed from storm damage she suffered in 2016. That is quite a while ago, but \nher indebtedness persists to this day. That is, it is recurring. Her debts are not mitigated \nunder AG \u00b6 20(a). \nI have considered mitigating condition AG \u00b6 20(b), which has two requirements. \nFirst, the conditions causing financial problems must have been \u201clargely beyond\u201d \nApplicant\u2019s control. Second, she must have \u201cacted responsibly\u201d under the adverse \ncircumstances she confronted. \nIn her PSI, Applicant went into credible detail about the damage the 2016 storm \nwreaked on her home. She detailed $15,000 of damage alone for a leaking roof and \ninterior carpeting. That is a significant amount. She also explained how she initially used \ncredit cards to keep herself afloat to pay for uninsured losses. At some point, however, \nher juggling of finances worsened to the point where she could no longer manage them. \nI find that the circumstances that caused her financial problems were \u201clargely beyond\u201d her \ncontrol. She satisfied the first requirement of AG \u00b6 20(b). \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe next inquiry under AG \u00b6 20(b) is whether Applicant acted responsibly in \nconfronting the adverse circumstances she faced. In her PSI, she did not dispute the SOR \ndebts reported in her credit reports. Her plan at that time was to contact each creditor for \ndetails and attempt some form of resolution. Her plan was to put her home up for sale, \nmove in with a family member, and use the expected profits from the sale of her home to \npay her delinquent debts. She was candid enough to note that one or more of those \nresolutions might have to await the sale of her home. That was a reasonable plan. \nThe problem is that in her Answer, a year after her PSI, she expressed the same \nplan, but she provided no evidence that she had taken any steps towards achieving that \nplan. She produced no evidence of her contacts with her creditors, no evidence that she \nhad placed her home on the market, no responses (even negative ones) from her \ncreditors about her reaching out to them. In short, on this record her plan of a year earlier \nremains just that, a plan. The Appeal Board respects an applicant\u2019s reasonable plan to \nresolve debts. The Board also expects an applicant to have taken some steps towards \nthe execution of that plan. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 09-08462 at 3 (App. Bd. May 3, \n2011). Here, Applicant has taken no such steps, She has not, therefore, acted responsibly \nas required by AG \u00b6 20(b). Therefore, her SOR debts have not been mitigated. By the \nsame reasoning, AG \u00b6 20(d) does not apply. \nThe Whole-Person Concept \nThe ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance \nmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nguidelines and the whole-person concept. AG \u00b6\u00b6 2(a) and (d)(1)-(9) (explaining the \n\u201cwhole-person\u201d concept and factors). In my analysis above, I considered the potentially \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions and the whole-person concept in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. \nApplicant leaves me with questions about her eligibility and suitability for a security \nclearance. For these reasons, I conclude that Applicant did not mitigate the security \nconcerns arising under Guideline F, financial considerations. \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.g: \nFor Applicant \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the interests of national security to \ngrant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact In his response to the SOR, Applicant admitted SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.c, 1.d, 1.h, and 1.k., and he denied SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.e, 1.f, 1.g, 1.i, and 1.j, all with brief comments. His admissions are incorporated into the findings of fact. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following additional findings of fact. Applicant is 42 years old. He has attended some college but has not earned a degree. He has been employed with a large defense contractor since January 2004, and he has held a clearance since 2015. He and his wife have been married since 2007. He has two children and two stepchildren.

The DOD CAF issued the SOR under \nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February \n20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the National \nSecurity Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) effective within the DOD on June 8, 2017. \nApplicant answered the SOR on September 21, 2022, and elected a decision by \nan administrative judge of the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) on the \n1 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nadministrative (written) record, in lieu of a hearing.

No \nresponse to the FORM was received. \nThe case was forwarded to the DOHA hearing office on December 19, 2022, and \nwas assigned to me on January 26, 2023. The SOR and the answer (Items 1 and 2) are \nthe pleadings in the case. Government Items 3 through 6 are admitted into evidence \nwithout objection. \nFindings of Fact \nIn his response to the SOR, Applicant admitted SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.c, 1.d, 1.h, and \n1.k., and he denied SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.e, 1.f, 1.g, 1.i, and 1.j, all with brief comments. His \nadmissions are incorporated into the findings of fact. After a thorough and careful review \nof the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following additional findings of fact. \nApplicant is 42 years old. He has attended some college but has not earned a \ndegree. He has been employed with a large defense contractor since January 2004, and \nhe has held a clearance since 2015. He and his wife have been married since 2007. He \nhas two children and two stepchildren. (Item 3) \nApplicant disclosed several debts on his SCA and he discussed them further in \nhis background interview. (Items 3, 6) His debts are established by credit reports from \nSeptember 2022 and March 2022. (Items 4, 5) \nThe SOR details 11 delinquent debts, totaling about $44,681. Applicant admitted \nsome but denied others, claiming he did not recognize them. (Item 2) They are \nestablished by Applicant\u2019s admissions and by the credit reports in the record from \nFebruary 2020, October 2021, and January 2022. (Items 5, 6, 7) \nApplicant stated that SOR \u00b6 1.f ($106), a charged-off debt to a financial institution, \nhad been paid after it went to collection. (Item 4) \nSOR \u00b6 1.g ($11,941) is the balance owed on a repossessed auto. Applicant \nasserted that he was not aware of any balance owed after the repossession. (Item 3 at \n36) It was initially charged off at $26,617 but the amount alleged is the balance owed. \n(Item 4) \nSOR \u00b6 1.a ($103) is an insurance bill placed for collection. (Item 4) SOR \u00b6 1.b \n($7,838) an account placed for collection by a lender. (Items 4, 5) SOR \u00b6 1.c ($575) an \naccount placed for collection by a phone or internet provider.

(Item 5) SOR \u00b6 1.k ($5,561) is an account charged off by a credit \nunion. (Item 5) \nFor the debts he admits, Applicant said that they were incurred when his wife was \nnot working, so he was the sole income in the household. He used credit cards and \ncheck-cashing institutions when he was falling behind on his debts. (Items 2, 3, 6) He \nprovided his background interviewer some documentation of payments on non-alleged \ndebts. (Item 6) \nFor the debts Applicant denied, he said he did not recognize them. (Item 3) He \nset forth no plan to dispute or address his delinquent debts. He provided no \ndocumentation of any payments or any details about any arrangements or agreements \nto pay his debts, either through the debt relief company or to the individual creditors. He \nprovided no documentation to support his assertions in his background interview that his \nfinancial stability has improved. The record did not indicate that he participated in credit \ncounseling through the debt relief company, or otherwise. \nPolicies \nIt is well established that no one has a right to a security clearance. As the \nSupreme Court has held, \u201cthe clearly consistent standard indicates that security \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Department of the Navy \nv. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988). \nThe adjudicative guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. The protection of the national security is the \nparamount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel \nbeing considered for access to classified information will be resolved in favor of the \nnational security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are \nreasonable, logical, and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have \navoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set \nout, in relevant part, in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . .  \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified \ninformation. ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and  \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant incurred numerous debts in recent years. The debts are established by \nthe credit reports in the record and by Applicant\u2019s admissions. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c) \napply. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns \narising from financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are \npotentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and  \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue.  \nApplicant\u2019s debts are largely ongoing and unresolved. They continue to cast doubt \non his current reliability, judgment, and trustworthiness. AG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply. \nApplicant asserted that many of his delinquent debts occurred when he was the \nsole income earner in his household, due to the instability of his wife\u2019s employment. But \nHowever, for full application of AG \u00b6 20(b), he must also show that his subsequent \nactions are reasonable under the circumstances. Applicant provided no details about his \nefforts to resolve his debts. He did not establish that AG \u00b6 20(b) should apply.  \nFor similar reasons, Applicant did not establish that he has undertaken a good-\nfaith effort to resolve his debts, typically by establishing a track record of steady \npayments towards his creditors (through the debt relief company, or otherwise). He did \nnot establish that AG \u00b6 20(d) should apply. \nAG \u00b6 20(c) does not apply, as Applicant did not show that he has participated in \ncredit counseling or that his debts are being resolved or are under control. As to the \ndebts he denied, Applicant did not provide documentary evidence to support his \nassertions that he is not responsible for them. AG \u00b6 20(e) does not apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(a), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \n. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. Given the limited documentation in this case, \nApplicant did not provide sufficient evidence to mitigate his delinquent debts, even if they \noccurred due to a decline in household income. Since Applicant requested a decision on \nthe written record, I did not have the opportunity to question him in a hearing about the \nstatus of his SOR debts, to better assess the reasonableness of his actions in addressing \nthem. Overall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s \neligibility for a security clearance. This does not mean that at a later date he cannot \nestablish that he is taking reasonable steps to resolve his debts, but at this time, he has \nnot shown that he has done enough to mitigate the financial security concerns arising \nunder due to his delinquent debts. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.e:  \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.f:  \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.g-1.k: \nAgainst Applicant \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented, it is not clearly consistent with the \ninterests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified \ninformation.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant admitted to all the allegations in SOR with explanations. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant is a 60-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been employed with the defense contractor since April of 2007. Applicant has a bachelor\u2019s degree. He is married, and has no children. (TR at page 5 line 13 to page 6 line 6, at page 15 lines 1~20, and GX 1 at pages 7, 10, 11, 15 and 17.) Applicant attributes his current financial difficulties to the death of his mother in 2017, about six years ago. He incurred expenses dealing with her \u201chealth\u201d issues, and in arranging for her \u201cfuneral.\u201d (TR at page 16 line 23 to page 17 line 17, and at page 20 lines 13~25.) Guideline F - Financial Considerations 1.a. and 1.c. Applicant admits two past-due debts to Creditor A in amounts of $6,253 and $3,747. He has submitted nothing further regarding the $6,200 debt, but claims to have recently paid the $3,700 debt. (TR at page 16 line 7 to page 20 line 25, and at page 22 line 20 to page 23 line 21.) As both debts still appear as past-due on the Government\u2019s most recent March 2023 credit report, I find these two debts totaling $10,000 are still past due. (GX 5 at pages 5 and 6.) 1.b. Applicant admits a past-due debt to Creditor B in the amount of about $3,774, but claims to have recently paid this debt. (TR at page 21 line 2 to page 22 line 19.) The only document Applicant sub",

The hearing was convened \nas scheduled. The Government offered Exhibits (GXs) 1 through 6, which were \nadmitted into evidence. Applicant testified on his own behalf.

Applicant offered nothing further. DOHA received the transcript of the \nhearing (TR) on June 9, 2023. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant admitted to all the allegations in SOR with explanations. After a \nthorough and careful review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the \nfollowing findings of fact. \nApplicant is a 60-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been \nemployed with the defense contractor since April of 2007. Applicant has a bachelor\u2019s \ndegree. He is married, and has no children. (TR at page 5 line 13 to page 6 line 6, at \npage 15 lines 1~20, and GX 1 at pages 7, 10, 11, 15 and 17.) Applicant attributes his \ncurrent financial difficulties to the death of his mother in 2017, about six years ago. He \nincurred expenses dealing with her \u201chealth\u201d issues, and in arranging for her \u201cfuneral.\u201d \n(TR at page 16 line 23 to page 17 line 17, and at page 20 lines 13~25.) \nGuideline F - Financial Considerations \n1.a. and 1.c. Applicant admits two past-due debts to Creditor A in amounts of \n$6,253 and $3,747. He has submitted nothing further regarding the $6,200 debt, but \nclaims to have recently paid the $3,700 debt. (TR at page 16 line 7 to page 20 line 25, \nand at page 22 line 20 to page 23 line 21.) As both debts still appear as past-due on the \nGovernment\u2019s most recent March 2023 credit report, I find these two debts totaling \n$10,000 are still past due. (GX 5 at pages 5 and 6.) \n1.b. Applicant admits a past-due debt to Creditor B in the amount of about \n$3,774, but claims to have recently paid this debt. (TR at page 21 line 2 to page 22 line \n19.) The only document Applicant submits in this regard shows an outstanding \njudgment of $4,472. (AppX A.) I find this increased debt is still past due. \n1.d. Applicant admits a past-due debt to Creditor D in the amount of about \n$3,355, but has submitted nothing further in this regard. I find this debt is still past-due. \n1.e. Applicant admits a past-due debt to Creditor E in the amount of about \n$3,287, and submits documentation showing that he has recently set up a payment plan \nto address this admitted debt. (TR at page 23 line 22 to page 25 line 5, AppX B.) As \nApplicant has submitted nothing further in this regard, such as documents showing \npayments pursuant to his payment plan, I find this debt is still past due. \n1.f. Applicant admits a past-due debt to Creditor F in the amount of about $2,483, \nbut claims to have recently paid this debt. (TR at page 25 lines 6~21.) As this debt still \nappears as past-due on the Government\u2019s most recent March 2023 credit report, I find \nthis debt still past due. (GX 5 at page 5.) \n1.g. Applicant admits a past-due debt to Creditor G in the amount of about $871, \nbut claims to have recently paid this debt. (TR at page 25 line 22 to page 26 line 2.)

(TR at page 26 lines 3~8.) He has submitted nothing \nfurther in this regard. I find that this debt is still past due. \n1.i. Applicant admits a past-due debt to Creditor I in the amount of about $363, \nbut claims to have recently paid this debt. (TR at page 29 lines 9~16.) As Applicant has \nsubmitted nothing further in this regard, and as this debt appears as past-due on the \nGovernment\u2019s August 2022 credit report, I find this debt still past due. (GX 3 at page 4.) \n \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility, the administrative \njudge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief introductory \nexplanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying \nconditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s \nnational security eligibility. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the whole-person concept. The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states the \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nA person who applies for access to classified information seeks to enter into a \nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \nSection 7 of Executive Order (EO) 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall \nbe \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the \nloyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F - Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. Two are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant has past-due debts totaling over $23,000. The evidence is sufficient to \nraise these disqualifying conditions. \nAG \u00b6 20 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I considered \nall of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 including: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; \nNone of these apply. Applicant\u2019s financial problems are ongoing. He has history \nof delinquencies going back to 2017. Applicant has not demonstrated that future \nfinancial problems are unlikely. Mitigation under AG \u00b6 20 has not been established. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. Overall, the record evidence leaves me with \nquestions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. \nFor all these reasons, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the Financial \nConsiderations security concerns. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a.~1.f: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.g: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.h. and 1.i: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility \nfor a security clearance.

(Tr. at 41-48, 53-56; Applicant\u2019s response to \nSOR; GE 2-4; AE C-E) \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n4 \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant has a history of delinquent debts and financial problems. The evidence \nindicates that it was initially difficult for him to pay his debts, but he reached a point \nwhere he could pay at least some of his debts, but he just chose not to. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), \n19(b), and 19(c) are applicable. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems related to his separation, divorce, paying to \nmaintain households in two states, alimony, and child support. His separation and \ndivorce qualify as conditions that were largely beyond his control. To receive the full \nbenefit of AG \u00b6 20(b), he must also prove that he acted responsibly under the \ncircumstances. \nI am giving Applicant the benefit of the doubt on the $16,552 charged-off auto \nloan that he cosigned for his cousin (SOR \u00b6 1.b) and the disputed $410 debt to a \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ncollection company on behalf of a home security company (SOR \u00b6 1.j). Those debts are \nmitigated. \nApplicant has not paid any of the other SOR debts, and he does not intend to, as \nhe is waiting for them to age off his credit report. The fact that a debt no longer appears \non a credit report does not establish any meaningful, independent evidence as to the \ndisposition of the debt. See, e.g., ADP Case No. 14-02206 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 15, 2015) \nand ISCR Case No. 14-03612 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 25, 2015). He stated that three of the \ncredit union debts were cancelled through the issuance of an IRS Form 1099-C, but he \ndid not provide copies of the IRS forms nor of his income tax returns that would have \nincluded that information. The Appeal Board has held that \u201cit is reasonable for a Judge \nto expect applicants to present documentation about the satisfaction of specific debts.\u201d \nSee ISCR Case No. 09-07091 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 11, 2010) (quoting ISCR Case No. \n04-10671 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2006)). \nI am unable to find that Applicant acted responsibly under the circumstances or \nthat he made a good-faith effort to pay his debts. His financial issues are recent and \nongoing. They continue to cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good \njudgment. The above mitigating conditions, individually or collectively, are insufficient to \neliminate concerns about Applicant\u2019s finances. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. I also considered Applicant\u2019s \nhonorable military service and particularly his four deployments to Iraq and Afghanistan. \nHowever, AG \u00b6 2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered \nfor national security eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant did not \nmitigate the financial considerations security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.b: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.c-1.i: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.j: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \na security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nEdward W. Loughran \nAdministrative Judge \n7 \n",

Under \nSchedule E/F, Creditors Who Have Unsecured Claims, there were no priority unsecured \nclaims. Nonpriority unsecured claims totaled $31,857. (Items 1-4) \nIn August 2020, the Chapter 13 bankruptcy case was converted to a Chapter 7 \nbankruptcy, and his dischargeable debts were discharged. The trustee reported that \nduring the Chapter 13 bankruptcy, Applicant paid a total of $17,296. Of that amount, \n$4,418 went to attorney\u2019s fees, court costs, and trustee expenses and compensation; \n$12,063 went to secured claims; and $813 went to unsecured claims. (Items 1, 3, 4) \nApplicant did not file his federal and state income tax returns for tax years 2018 \nand 2019. He submitted a Questionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86) on April \n30, 2020. He reported that he had not filed his 2018 income tax returns. He wrote that \nhe was going to file them himself, so he would not have to pay anyone. He wrote that he \nplanned to file his 2018 returns with his 2019 returns. (Items 1-4) \nApplicant attributed his financial problems to his wife\u2019s medical condition, which \ncaused her to be frequently out of work. He was interviewed for his background \ninvestigation in June 2020. He discussed his financial issues. He stated that his wife\u2019s \nmedical condition was resolved through surgery about a year before the interview. He \nalso indicated that his wife had been unable to work as many hours because of the \nCOVID-19 pandemic and associated shutdowns. He stated that his wife filed her 2018 \ntax returns, and he was supposed to go with her to the tax preparer to have his returns \nprepared at the same time, but he did not go with her. He decided to file his returns \nwithout the assistance of a tax preparer in order to save money. His returns were more \ndifficult than he anticipated, and he decided to wait and file them with his 2019 returns. \nHe planned to pay to have the 2018 and 2019 returns prepared, and he would file the \nreturns for both years in July 2020. (Item 3) \nApplicant timely filed his 2020 and 2021 income tax returns. He responded to \ninterrogatories in May 2022. He reported that he had still not filed the 2018 and 2019 \nreturns. He wrote that his wife is disabled and unable to work, and she was in the \nprocess of applying for disability. He stated that they were struggling financially, and \nthey could not afford the $300 to $400 for each year that the tax preparers wanted to \ncharge him.

I will get these filed with 2022 tax returns.\u201d He \ndid not respond to the FORM, so there is no evidence that the returns have been filed. \n(Item 1) \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \nApplicant was unable to pay his debts and filed for bankruptcy protection. He did \nnot file his 2018 and 2019 federal and state income tax returns. The above disqualifying \nconditions are applicable. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nApplicant attributed his financial problems to his wife\u2019s medical condition that left \nher unable to work. Bankruptcy was a reasonable response to those issues. The \nbankruptcy, as alleged in SOR \u00b6 1(c), is mitigated. \nApplicant has still not filed his 2018 and 2019 federal and state income tax \nreturns. Failure to comply with tax laws suggests that an applicant has a problem with \nabiding by well-established government rules and systems. Voluntary compliance with \nrules and systems is essential for protecting classified information. See, e.g., ISCR \nCase No. 16-01726 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 28, 2018). A person who fails repeatedly to fulfill \ntheir legal obligations, such as filing tax returns when due, does not demonstrate the \nhigh degree of good judgment and reliability required of those granted access to \nclassified information. \nApplicant claimed that he could not afford to have someone prepare his returns. \nHowever, his wife filed her 2018 tax returns, and he was supposed to go with her to \nhave his returns completed at the same time, but he did not go. I do not accept that in \nfour years Applicant could not make arrangements to file his returns. There are no \nmitigating conditions applicable to the unfiled returns. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant did not \nmitigate the financial considerations security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.c: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \na security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nEdward W. Loughran \nAdministrative Judge \n6 \n",

No post-hearing exhibits were submitted. \nSome details were excluded to protect Applicant\u2019s right to privacy. Specific \ninformation is available in the cited exhibits and transcript. \nFindings of Fact \nIn Applicant\u2019s SOR response, he admitted the SOR allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through \n1.h.

(Tr. 24) His two \nchildren are ages five and two. (Tr. 24) He was promoted from deputy program manager \nto program manager in April 2022. (Tr. 25) He has held a security clearance since 2004, \nand there is no evidence of security violations, alcohol abuse, use of illegal drugs, or \ncriminal conduct. (Tr. 25, 53; GE 1) \nFinancial Considerations \nApplicant said his debts became delinquent because of divorce, unemployment, \nand underemployment. (Tr. 57) In December 2013, he borrowed funds to pay a $67,000 \ndivorce settlement in a Middle Eastern country. (Tr. 26-28, 57-60) He was not permitted \nto leave the Middle Eastern country until the settlement was paid. (Tr. 58) \nFrom July 2009 to July 2014, Applicant was employed in a foreign country, and his \nannual salary was $115,000 to $120,000. (Tr. 27-28) From July 2014 to September 2014, \nhe was unemployed for about six weeks. In September 2014, his annual pay was reduced \nto $75,000, when he changed employment to a different company in the same Middle \nEastern country. (Tr. 27-28) His new employment did not include housing, car allowance, \nand some other benefits he received during his previous employment.

(GE 1) On July 8, \n2022, he paid $934 to resolve one non-SOR delinquent bank debt. (GE 2 at 35, 37) On \nJune 15, 2022, he paid another delinquent debt listed on his SOR.

He had a signature loan, a credit-card debt, and two vehicle loans, respectively. \n(Tr. 29) The two vehicles with liens from the creditor were returned to the creditor at one \nof their branch locations in a Middle Eastern country in 2015. (Tr. 32, 61-64) He was \nunaware of what the credit union employees did with the two vehicles. The vehicle debts \nwere SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d and 1.e, and he believed the creditor did not give him a credit for the \nreturn of the vehicles. (Tr. 32-34, 62-63) \nWhen he was unable to make payments to the credit union because of his reduced \nsalary, he contacted the creditor, and he received a one-month forbearance. (Tr. 29; AE \nA) He defaulted on the loans in April 2015. (Tr. 26-27, 60; AE A) He repeatedly contacted \nthe creditor over the years, and the creditor\u2019s best offer is for him to pay 45 percent of the \ndebt over a two-year period. (Tr. 29; AE A) He asked the creditor to credit him with \nreturning the two vehicles; however, the creditor refused to do so. (Tr. 34) The monthly \npayments would be $2,400 for a total of about $55,000. (Tr. 29) He provided a copy of \nhis correspondence with the creditor. (Tr. 30; AE A) He was unable to afford the $2,400 \nmonthly payments. (Tr. 30)  \nApplicant most recently communicated with the creditor six weeks before his \nhearing, and the creditor\u2019s offer continued to be to settle the debt for 45 percent of the \nface amount by making payments over 24 months. (Tr. 54) The four debts are not \naccruing interest. (Tr. 55, 67) He has currently saved $4,000 to pay the creditor. (Tr. 55) \nOnce he has a larger amount available, he plans to offer the creditor an initial lump-sum \npayment and then to make payments under a more realistic payment plan. (Tr. 66) In his \nSCA and response to interrogatories, he noted the four debts were collection-barred by \nthe statute of limitations and had aged off or been dropped from his credit report. (GE 1; \nGE 2 at 20, 49) He is not relying on the statute of limitations to avoid paying the four \ndebts.

(Tr. 36) His only connection to \nState A was his State A driver\u2019s license, which expired in 2012. (Tr. 36, 43) He believed \nhe was not required to file a State A income tax return or pay taxes to State A because \nhe did not consider himself to be a resident of State A. (Tr. 36-37) He did not do anything \nto establish residence in a tax-free state until he left the Middle Eastern country, and he \nreturned to the United States in 2018. (Tr. 77) After 2018, he lived in a state with no state \nincome taxes. (Tr. 37, 46) His spouse is a resident of the tax-free state where he currently \nresides. (Tr. 78) He filed his federal income tax returns in 2019 within the time limits \nauthorized by the IRS for a U.S. citizen living outside the United States, and State A \nwanted him to pay income taxes for TYs 2013 to 2016. (Tr. 36-37, 47) \nApplicant first learned of State A\u2019s tax liens when DOHA contacted him in October \nof 2022.

Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The President \nhas authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicant\u2019s eligibility for \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Clearance \ndecisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \nThus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that it is based, in whole or \nin part, on any express or implied determination about applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or \npatriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the \nPresident, Secretary of Defense, and Director of National Intelligence have established \nfor issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability.

May 2, 1996). \n5 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts.

Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.    \nThe Appeal Board explained the scope and rationale for the financial \nconsiderations security concern in ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) \n(citation omitted) as follows: \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might \nknowingly compromise classified information in order to raise money in \nsatisfaction of his or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the \ntotality of an applicant\u2019s financial history and circumstances. The Judge \nmust consider pertinent evidence regarding the applicant\u2019s self-control, \njudgment, and other qualities essential to protecting the national secrets as \nwell as the vulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive \npresumes a nexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines \nand an applicant\u2019s security eligibility. \nIn ISCR Case No. 08-12184 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan. 7, 2010), the Appeal Board \nexplained: \nIt is well-settled that adverse information from a credit report can normally \nmeet the substantial evidence standard and the government\u2019s obligations \nunder [Directive] \u00b6 E3.1.14 for pertinent allegations. At that point, the burden \n6 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nshifts to applicant to establish either that [he or] she is not responsible for \nthe debt or that matters in mitigation apply. \n(internal citation omitted). \nAG \u00b6 19 includes disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern and \nmay be disqualifying in this case: \u201c(a) inability to satisfy debts\u201d; \u201c(c) a history of not meeting \nfinancial obligations\u201d; and \u201c(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or \nlocal income tax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired.\u201d The record establishes AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), 19(c), and 19(f). Further discussion of the \ndisqualifying conditions and the applicability of mitigating conditions is contained in the \nmitigation section, infra. \nThe financial considerations mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are as follows: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and   \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \nIn ISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013), the DOHA Appeal \nBoard explained an applicant\u2019s responsibility for proving the applicability of mitigating \nconditions as follows: \nOnce a concern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility, \nthere is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of a security \nclearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th Cir. 1990), \ncert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991).

A component is whether \nhe maintained contact with creditors and attempted to negotiate partial payments to keep \ndebts current. Applicant provided supporting documentary evidence that he initiated or \nmaintained contact with several creditors. SOR \u00b6 20(b) is established. \nApplicant indicated several of his SOR debts were dropped from his credit report. \n\u201c[T]hat some debts have dropped off his [or her] credit report is not meaningful evidence \nof debt resolution.\u201d ISCR Case No. 14-05803 at 3 (App. Bd. July 7, 2016) (citing ISCR \nCase No. 14-03612 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 25, 2015)). The Fair Credit Reporting Act requires \nremoval of most negative financial items from a credit report seven years from the first \ndate of delinquency or the debt becoming collection barred because of a state statute of \nlimitations, whichever is longer. See Title 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681c. See Federal Trade \nCommission website, Summary of Fair Credit Reporting Act Updates at Section 605, \nhttps://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/pdf-0111-fair-credit-reporting-act.pdf. Debts may \nbe dropped from a credit report upon dispute when creditors believe the debt is not going \nto be paid, a creditor fails to timely respond to a credit reporting company\u2019s request for \ninformation, or when the debt has been charged off. \nIn his SCA and response to interrogatories, Applicant noted the four debts were \ncollection-barred by the statute of limitations and had aged off or been dropped from his \ncredit report. However, he is not relying on the statute of limitations to avoid paying the \nfour debts. An explanation of the relationship between state statutes of limitations and \nsecurity concerns is helpful. \nState statutes of limitations for various types of debts range from 2 to 15 years. \nSee Nolo Law for All website, Chart: Statutes of Limitations in All 50 States, \nhttp://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/statute-of-limitations-state-laws-chart-\n29941.html. It is illegal under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act for a creditor to \nthreaten to sue to collect a time-barred debt. See Federal Trade Commission website, \n\u201cDebt Collection FAQs,\u201d http://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/0117-time-barred-debts. \nThe South Carolina Court of Appeals succinctly explained the societal and judicial value \nof application of the statute of limitations: \n8 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nStatutes of limitations embody important public policy considerations in that \nthey stimulate activity, punish negligence and promote repose by giving \nsecurity and stability to human affairs. The cornerstone policy consideration \nunderlying statutes of limitations is the laudable goal of law to promote and \nachieve finality in litigation. Significantly, statutes of limitations provide \npotential defendants with certainty that after a set period of time, they will \nnot be [haled] into court to defend time-barred claims. Moreover, limitations \nperiods discourage plaintiffs from sitting on their rights. Statutes of \nlimitations are, indeed, fundamental to our judicial system. \nCarolina Marine Handling, Inc. v. Lasch, 363 S.C. 169, 175-76, 609 S.E.2d 548, 552 (S.C. \nCt. App. 2005) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). South Carolina case law \nis not binding on state courts in other states. However, the South Carolina Court of \nAppeals\u2019 description of the basis for this long-standing legal doctrine is instructive. See \nalso Tulsa Professional Collection Services, Inc. v. Pope, 485 U.S. 478, 486 (1988) \n(where the U.S. Supreme Court noted that \u201cThe State\u2019s interest in a self-executing statute \nof limitations is in providing repose for potential defendants and in avoiding stale claims.\u201d). \nA state statute of limitations may be tolled when the debtor is outside the United States, \nor it may restart under some circumstances. \nOnce Applicant stopped making payments, the creditor had to file suit within the \nstatute of limitations to maintain the collectability of their debt. There is no evidence that \nthe creditors in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 1.d, or 1.e took judicial action to pursue collection of \nthese four debts. Assuming but not deciding that these four SOR debts are collection \nbarred, they are still relevant to financial considerations security concerns: \nApplicant\u2019s argument concerning the unenforceability of the largest debt \ndue to the running of the statute of limitations fails to demonstrate the Judge \nerred. First, security clearance decisions are not controlled or limited by \nstatutes of limitations. Second, absent an explicit act of Congress to the \ncontrary, the Federal Government is not bound by state law in carrying out \nits functions and responsibilities. Applicant does not cite to any Federal \nstatute that requires the Federal Government to be bound by state law in \nmaking security clearance decisions. Third, a security clearance \nadjudication is not a proceeding aimed at collecting an applicant\u2019s personal \ndebts. Rather, it is a proceeding aimed at evaluating an applicant\u2019s \njudgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. Accordingly, even if a delinquent \ndebt is legally unenforceable under state law, has been discharged in a \nbankruptcy, or is paid, the Federal Government is entitled to consider the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding an applicant\u2019s conduct in incurring and \nfailing to satisfy the debt in a timely manner. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 01-\n09691 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 27, 2003). In this case, the Judge\u2019s consideration \nof the unenforceable debt in making her security clearance eligibility \ndetermination was not arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. \n9 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nISCR Case No. 15-02326 at 3 (App. Bd.

The Appeal Board has \u201cheld that \nreliance on a state\u2019s statute of limitations does not constitute a good-faith effort to resolve \nfinancial difficulties and is of limited mitigative value.\u201d ISCR Case No. 15-01208 at 3 (App. \nBd.

See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 08-01122 (App. Bd. Feb. 9, 2009) \n(reversing grant of security clearance); ADP Case No. 06-14616 (App. Bd.

It is a \nprocedure designed to evaluate an applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. \nSee ISCR Case No. 09-02160 (App. Bd. Jun. 21, 2010). Applicants are not required \u201cto \nbe debt-free in order to qualify for a security clearance. Rather, all that is required is that \nan applicant act responsibly given his circumstances and develop a reasonable plan for \nrepayment, accompanied by \u2018concomitant conduct\u2019 that is, actions which evidence a \nserious intent to effectuate the plan.\u201d ISCR Case No. 15-02903 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 9, \n2017) (denial of security clearance remanded) (citing ISCR Case No.13-00987 at 3, n. 5 \n(App. Bd. Aug. 14, 2014). There is no requirement that an applicant make payments on \nall delinquent debts simultaneously, nor is there a requirement that the debts alleged in \nthe SOR be paid first. See ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008). \nApplicant paid or settled all of the SOR debts except the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, \n1.d, and 1.e. He promised to expeditiously resolve the last four debts. He acted \nresponsibly under the circumstances and made a good-faith effort to pay his debts. His \ndelinquent debts \u201coccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does \nnot cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment,\u201d and ability to \nprotect classified information. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(b) and 20(d) apply. Security concerns about \nApplicant\u2019s finances are mitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n10 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n     \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), \u201c[t]he ultimate determination\u201d of whether to grant a security \nclearance \u201cmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines\u201d and the whole-person concept. My comments under Guideline F are \nincorporated in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that guideline but some warrant additional comment. \nThe rationale for approving Applicant\u2019s clearance is more substantial than the \nreasons for denying his clearance. Applicant is a 44-year-old program manager. His \nresume provides details about his professional experiences and accomplishments. He \nwas promoted from deputy program manager to program manager in April 2022. He has \nheld a security clearance since 2004, and there is no evidence of security violations, \nalcohol abuse, use of illegal drugs, or criminal conduct. \nApplicant\u2019s supervisor for 18 months described him as the top person he \nsupervised out of 114 employees. He has outstanding integrity, honesty, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. If his supervisor was starting a new company, Applicant is the first person \nhe would hire. He received performance awards, completed courses, received certificates \nof achievement, and accomplished several certifications. His letters of recommendation \nlaud his diligence and professionalism. He has excellent performance evaluations. He \nvolunteers in his community. He is dedicated to his company, community, and family. \nApplicant acted responsibly under the circumstances. His debts resulted from \ndivorce in 2014, unemployment in 2024, and underemployment in 2015 to 2018. He made \na good-faith mistake when he assumed he had changed his state of residence for state \nincome tax purposes while he was living in the Middle East; however, he failed to establish \nconnections to his new state of residence. He realized his financial mistakes; he took \ncorrective actions; and he assured that he will continue to endeavor to maintain his \nfinancial responsibility. \nThe remaining four SOR debts are owed to the same creditor, who is seeking \n$2,400 monthly payments for 24 months. Applicant believed he was unable to make these\nmonthly payments because of his other financial responsibilities. He is saving about\n$1,000 monthly to accumulate enough money to settle or negotiate a more reasonable\npayment plan. All of the other SOR debts are resolved. I am confident he will maintain his\nfinancial responsibility. He understands that he needs to pay his debts, and the conduct\nrequired to retain his security clearance. He was sincere and credible at his hearing. His\nefforts at debt resolution are shown in his October 20, 2022 credit report, which reflects\n10 accounts in \u201cPays as agreed status,\u201d and one paid charged-off account with a zero\nbalance. He has made the necessary efforts at debt resolution and establishment of his\nfinancial responsibility. He has established a \u201cmeaningful track record\u201d of debt re-\npayment. See ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008).

He may \nbe required to show documented resolution of the four unresolved debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, \n1.c, 1.d, and 1.e. A broken promise to pay debts made during a security clearance hearing \ncan have adverse consequences in a future security clearance adjudication. It is \nimperative that he continue his efforts to resolve these four debts, and that he maintain \nhis financial responsibility. \nIt is well settled that once a concern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s security \nclearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption against granting a security clearance. \nSee Dorfmont, 913 F. 2d at 1401. Applicant\u2019s evidence was sufficient to overcome the \nDorfmont presumption. I have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Egan, Exec. Or. \n10865, the Directive, the AGs, and the Appeal Board\u2019s jurisprudence to the facts and \ncircumstances in the context of the whole person. Applicant mitigated financial \nconsiderations security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.h: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances in this case, it is clearly consistent with the \ninterests of national security to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines (AG) list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision.

The administrative judge must \nconsider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable \nand unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14, requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nA person applying for national security eligibility seeks to enter into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants national security eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or \nsensitive information. Finally, as emphasized in Section 7 of Executive Order 10865, \n\u201c[a]ny determination under this order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in \nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty \nof the applicant concerned.\u201d See also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing \nmultiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information.) \nAnalysis \nGuideline H: Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Drug Involvement and \nSubstance Misuse is set forth at AG \u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" \nas defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term \nadopted in this guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 25 contains seven conditions that could raise a security \nconcern and may be disqualifying. Two conditions are established: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); and \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia. \nAppellant used marijuana, cocaine, psilocybin mushrooms, ecstasy, and \nketamine, with varying frequency from about 2015 to 2022, a period of about seven \nyears. He also cultivated psilocybin mushrooms. Therefore, AG \u00b6 25 (a) and (c) are \nestablished. \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 26 contains four conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns. Two conditions may be applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \nand \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts;  \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were \nused; and  \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all \ndrug involvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that \nany future involvement or misuse is grounds for revocation \nof national security eligibility. \nNone of these apply. Applicant\u2019s drug abuse ceased only seven months prior to \nthe issuance of the SOR, and only a month prior to him executing his e-QIP. It is too \nsoon to say that Applicant drug involvement and substance misuse will not reoccur. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s national security eligibility by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national \nsecurity eligibility must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the applicable guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered \nthe potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is well thought of in the workplace and \nin his community. (Answer at pages 7 and 8.) However, it is too soon to say that \nApplicant\u2019s drug abuse will not reoccur. Overall, the record evidence leaves me with \nquestions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. \nFor all these reasons, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns \narising from his drug involvement and substance abuse. However, this should not \ndissuade Applicant from applying for a security clearance in the future, following a \nlonger period of abstinence. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a~1.e: \nAgainst Applicant \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility \nfor a security clearance.

Applicant is a long-time \nrecreational marijuana user. He intends to use the drug in the future. Clearance is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn September 23, 2022, the DOD issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing \nsecurity concerns under the drug involvement and substance misuse guideline. This \naction was taken under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information \nwithin Industry, signed by President Eisenhower on February 20, 1960, as amended; \nas well as DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance \nReview Program, dated January 2, 1992, as amended (Directive), and the National \nSecurity Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified \nInformation or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position, implemented on June 8, 2017. \nDOD adjudicators were unable to find that it is clearly consistent with the national interest \nto grant Applicant's security clearance and recommended that the case be submitted \nto an administrative judge for a determination whether to deny his security clearance. \n1 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR and requested a decision without a hearing. \n(Government Exhibit (GE) 2) The Government submitted its written case on March 6, \n2023. Applicant received a complete copy of the file of relevant material on March 14, \n2023. In the FORM, the Government informed Applicant that it was offering a summary \nof his January 2022 subject interview with a background investigator into evidence. The \nGovernment advised him of his ability to object to, correct, add, delete, or update the \ninformation in the subject interview summary. The Government further advised him that \nfailure to respond could result in a determination by the administrative judge that he \nwaived any objection to the document\u2019s admissibility. He did not respond. Accordingly, \nthe documents appended to the FORM, including the summary, are admitted as GE 1 \nthrough 4, without objection. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant, 44, has worked for his employer, a federal contractor, since December \n2021, in an information technology position. He submitted a security clearance \napplication, his first, also in December 2021. He disclosed a history of marijuana use and \nhis intent to continue using the drug. He confirmed these disclosures in a January 2022 \nsubject interview with a background investigator. He also admitted to purchasing the drug. \nThe SOR alleges these facts as disqualifying under the drug involvement and substance \nmisuse guideline. He admitted the allegation, SOR \u00b6 1.a, without explanation.

(GE 4) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nApplicant admits to recreational marijuana use for more than 20 years and that he \nwill continue to use the drug in the future. The illegal use of controlled substances can \nraise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness because such \nbehavior may lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and \nregulations. (AG \u00b6 25) The following disqualifying conditions apply: \nAG \u00b6 26(a) any substance misuse; and \nAG \u00b6 26(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including \ncultivation, processing manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or \npossession of drug paraphernalia. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nNone of the guideline\u2019s mitigating conditions apply. The legalization of marijuana \nuse or purchase from state-sanctioned dispensaries in Applicant\u2019s state of residency does \nnot alter federal law or existing National Security Guidelines. No state can authorize the \nviolation of federal law. Applicant\u2019s marijuana use violates the Controlled Substances Act, \nwhich identifies marijuana as a Schedule I controlled drug. Under the Intelligence Reform \nand Terrorism Prevention Act (IRTPA), as amended, federal agencies remain prohibited \nfrom granting a security clearance to an unlawful user of a controlled substance. (See \nDirector of National Intelligence Memorandum, Adherence to Federal Laws Prohibiting \nMarijuana Use, dated November 17, 2014). The Agency clarified its guidance concerning \nmarijuana for individuals eligible to access classified information in a memorandum dated \nDecember 21, 2021: \nWith regard to the first topic, agencies are instructed that prior recreational \nmarijuana use by an individual may be relevant to adjudications but not \ndeterminative. The [Security Executive Agent (SecEA)] has provided \ndirection in SEAD 4 to agencies that requires them to use a \"whole-person \nconcept.\" This requires adjudicators to carefully weigh a number of \nvariables in an individual's life to determine whether that individual's \nbehavior raises a security concern, if at all, and whether that concern has \nbeen mitigated such that the individual may now receive a favorable \nadjudicative determination. Relevant mitigations include, but are not limited \nto, frequency of use and. whether the individual can demonstrate that future \nuse is unlikely to recur, including by signing an attestation or other such \nappropriate mitigation. Additionally, in light of the long-standing- federal law \nand policy prohibiting illegal drug use while occupying a sensitive position \nor holding a security clearance, agencies are encouraged to advise \nprospective national security workforce employees that they should refrain \nfrom any future marijuana use upon initiation of the national security vetting \nprocess, which commences once the individual signs the certification \ncontained in the Standard Form 86 (SF-86), Questionnaire for National \nSecurity Positions. \nGiven his intent to continue using the drug, Applicant has not mitigated the alleged \nsecurity concerns. \nWhole-person Concept \nBased on the record, doubts remain about Applicant\u2019s current security worthiness. \nThis decision is not changed by a consideration of the facts under the whole-person \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2(d). Applicant failed to meet his burdens of persuasion and \nproduction to mitigate the alleged concerns. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:\n \n  \n \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented, it is not clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant Applicant a security clearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is 45 years old. He graduated from high school in June 1996. He enlisted in the U.S. Navy in 1996 and was honorably discharged in 2015. He married in 2019 and has no children. After separating from the Navy, Applicant worked for a government contractor from September 2017 to December 2020. Since January 2021, he has been employed by a different government contractor as a senior data link analyst. He has held a DOD security clearance since 2011. The SOR alleges four delinquent accounts totaling $20,719. In his Answer, Applicant admitted all four of the delinquent accounts. He provided no further information about the circumstances that triggered these delinquencies nor his efforts to resolve them. (Item 1) During his November 19, 2021 background interview, Applicant discussed the four delinquent accounts listed in the SOR. He did not list them on his September 2021 security clearance application, as required, due to oversight. He explained that these accounts became delinquent for several reasons: he had forgotten about paying them; he had not received any statements; he was immature; he was unmotivated to pay; he had used credit cards to pay for his wedding and honeymoon; financially he \u201cwas in over his head\u201d; he had other bills that took priority; and he had insufficient income to pay off these accounts. He told the investigator that he recently received a raise at work and planned to use the additional income to pay these four delinquent accounts.",

He did not make any payments on the other two delinquent debts. He did not \ntake responsible action to address his financial obligations until his security clearance \nwas in peril, and he still has unresolved delinquent debt. Eligibility for access to classified \ninformation is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn December 13, 2022, the Department of Defense (DOD) Consolidated \nAdjudications Facility (CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing \nsecurity concerns under Guideline F (financial considerations). The CAF took action \nunder Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \n(February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nadjudicative guidelines implemented by the DOD on June 8, 2017. \nOn December 22, 2022, Applicant responded to the SOR. He admitted all four \nalleged delinquent accounts, without any further explanation or documentation in support \nof mitigation or extenuation. He requested a determination on the written record, in lieu \nof a hearing before a Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) administrative \njudge.

Department Counsel\u2019s FORM \nincludes Items 1 through 6. Item 3 is the summary of an interview with an investigator \nfrom the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) conducted in March 2020. The FORM \nincludes a notice to Applicant informing him of his opportunity to make any corrections, \nadditions, deletions, and updates to the interview summary or to object to the admissibility \nof Item 3. The notice further informs Applicant that if he does not raise an objection or \nrespond to the FORM, a DOHA administrative judge may determine that he has waived \nany objections to the admissibility of the summaries. \nOn February 20, 2023, Applicant received the FORM and its attachments. He \ntimely submitted documentation I labeled as Applicant Exhibits (AE) A and B, there were \nno objections, and all proffered documents were admitted into evidence. The case was \nassigned to me on June 1, 2023. On July 17, 2023, I requested Department Counsel \nprovide a current credit report, and I requested that Applicant provide evidence of his \npayments and other relevant documentation. I held the record open until July 24, 2023. \nDepartment Counsel submitted a credit report (Item 7) the same day as my request, and \nApplicant timely submitted documentation I labeled as AE C and D. There were no \nobjections, and all proffered post-hearing documents were admitted into evidence. The \nrecord closed July 24, 2023. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is 45 years old. He graduated from high school in June 1996. He enlisted \nin the U.S. Navy in 1996 and was honorably discharged in 2015. He married in 2019 and \nhas no children. After separating from the Navy, Applicant worked for a government \ncontractor from September 2017 to December 2020. Since January 2021, he has been \nemployed by a different government contractor as a senior data link analyst. He has held \na DOD security clearance since 2011. \nThe SOR alleges four delinquent accounts totaling $20,719. In his Answer, \nApplicant admitted all four of the delinquent accounts. He provided no further information \nabout the circumstances that triggered these delinquencies nor his efforts to resolve \nthem. (Item 1) \nDuring his November 19, 2021 background interview, Applicant discussed the four \ndelinquent accounts listed in the SOR. He did not list them on his September 2021 \nsecurity clearance application, as required, due to oversight. He explained that these \naccounts became delinquent for several reasons: he had forgotten about paying them; \nhe had not received any statements; he was immature; he was unmotivated to pay; he \nhad used credit cards to pay for his wedding and honeymoon; financially he \u201cwas in over \nhis head\u201d; he had other bills that took priority; and he had insufficient income to pay off \nthese accounts. He told the investigator that he recently received a raise at work and \nplanned to use the additional income to pay these four delinquent accounts.

He was asked \nabout the four delinquent accounts, which he claimed he was repaying, but he did not \nattach supporting documentation. He also provided a July 2022 personal financial \nstatement that showed his monthly net income as $3,700. After paying his monthly \nexpenses, to include payments on the four delinquent accounts, he had a monthly net \nremainder of $1,000. He also provided a copy of his bi-weekly paystub. According to this \ninformation, it appears his monthly net income should reflect $6,894. In this scenario, after \npaying his monthly expenses, to include listed payments on the four SOR delinquent \ndebts, his monthly net remainder was over $4,500. (Item 4) \nSOR \u00b6 1.a alleges that Applicant is indebted to a federal credit union in the \napproximate amounts of $14,337, for a charged-off account that became delinquent in \n2019. In his July 2022 PFS, he listed that he was making monthly payments of $200 on \nthis account, however, the July 2023 credit report shows that this account had not \nreceived payments and remains unpaid in the amount of $14,337. Applicant has not \nprovided sufficient documentation to show the current status of this account or what \nefforts, if any, he is making to pay this account. This debt remains unresolved. (Item 1, \nItem 4, Item 5, Item 6, Item 7) \nSOR \u00b6 1.b alleges that Applicant is indebted to a federal credit union in the \napproximate amount of $5,627, for a charged-off account that became delinquent in 2019. \nIn his July 2022 PFS, he listed that he was making monthly payments of $100 on this \naccount, however, the December 2022 repayment agreement showed that he had not \nmade any payments on the account until December 2022. Since that time, Applicant has \nmade monthly payments in accordance with the repayment agreement through July 2023. \nThis debt is being resolved. (Item 1, Item 4, Item 5, Item 6, Item 7; AE A, AE C) \nSOR \u00b6 1.c alleges that Applicant is indebted to a federal credit union in the \napproximate amount of $500, for a charged-off account that became delinquent in 2019. \nIn his July 2022 PFS, he listed that he was making monthly payments of $50 on this \naccount, however, the December 2022 repayment agreement showed that he had not \nmade any payments on the account until December 2022. Since that time, Applicant has \nmade monthly payments in accordance with the repayment agreement through July 2023. \nThis debt is being resolved. (Item 1, Item 4, Item 5, Item 6, Item 7; AE B, AE D) \nSOR \u00b6 1.d alleges that Applicant is indebted to a collection agency in the \napproximate amount of $255 for an account referred for collection in 2018 by a bank. He \nhas not provided sufficient documentation to show the current status of this account or \nwhat efforts, if any, he is making to pay this account. This debt remains unresolved. (Item \n1, Item 4, Item 5, Item 6) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines.

Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. . . . \nThe Government and the record established that Applicant has four delinquent \naccounts totaling approximately $20,719. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) (inability to satisfy debts) and 19(c) \n(a history of not meeting financial obligations) apply. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce, or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant bears the burdens of production and persuasion in mitigation. An \napplicant is not held to a standard of perfection in his or her debt-resolution efforts or \nrequired to be debt-free. \u201cRather, all that is required is than an applicant act responsibly \ngiven his circumstances and develop a reasonable plan for repayment, accompanied by \n\u2018concomitant conduct,\u2019 that is, actions which evidence a serious intent to effectuate the \nplan.\u201d ISCR Case No. 15-02903 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 9, 2017). See, e.g., ISCR Case No. \n13-00987 at 3, n. 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 14, 2014). \nAlthough Applicant\u2019s delinquencies arose several years ago, they have persisted \nwith little evidence of debt-resolution efforts by him, even though he had the financial \nresources to do so. An individual entrusted to safeguard sensitive and classified \ninformation is expected to act in a financially responsible manner. During his November \n2021 security interview, Applicant acknowledged his financial delinquencies and \nexpressed his intent to make payment arrangements to resolve his debts; however, there \nis no evidence that he followed through on his stated intent. Also contributing to my \nassessment of Applicant\u2019s intent and credibility is the fact that he claimed he was making \nmonthly payments to his delinquent creditors on his July 2022 PFS, however, the record \nevidence showed that this was not the case. It was only after the SOR was issued in \nDecember 2022 when Applicant finally took action to begin resolving two out of the four \nSOR debts.

To receive full credit under Mitigating Condition 20(d), an \napplicant must initiate and adhere \u201cto a good faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts.\u201d Directive, Encl. 2, App. A \u00b6 20(d). The Appeal Board has \nconsistently held that a \u201cgood-faith effort\u201d generally requires that an applicant has \nestablished a meaningful financial track record of payments, to include evidence of actual \ndebt reduction. See, e.g., ISCR Case 05-01920 at 5 (App. Bd. Mar. 1, 2007). Promises \nof future repayment are not a substitute for a history of payment. See, e.g., ISCR Case \nNo. 14-04565 at 2 (App. Bd. Sep. 18, 2015). Moreover, an applicant who begins to resolve \nsecurity concerns only after having been placed on notice that his clearance is in jeopardy \nmay lack the judgment and willingness to follow rules and regulations when his personal \ninterests are not threatened. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-01256 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 3, \n2018). Given the facts that Applicant had made no payments to his four delinquent \ncreditors, as promised during his November 2021 background interview, or made monthly \npayments as claimed on his July 2021 PFS, I find that his finances continue to cast doubt \non his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. Financial considerations \nsecurity concerns are not mitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances \nsurrounding this case.

Although Applicant expressed \nhis intent to initiate debt-resolution efforts, there is no evidence that he has acted upon \nhis stated intent until the SOR was issued in December 2022. He failed to establish that \nhe acted responsibly under the circumstances after his PFS showed he had sufficient \nincome to establish payment plans and resolve his delinquent debts. Repaying these \ncreditors was not a priority until Applicant\u2019s security clearance was in peril. Given the \nentirety of the record evidence, I conclude that Applicant did not mitigate the financial \nconsiderations security concerns. \nThis decision should not be construed as a determination that Applicant cannot or \nwill not attain the state of true reform and rehabilitation necessary to be eligible for a \nsecurity clearance. The determination of an individual\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a \nsecurity clearance is not a once in a lifetime occurrence, but is based on applying the \nfactors, both disqualifying and mitigating, to the evidence presented. Applicant setting up \nrepayment plans and making payments in accordance with the plans is a positive step. \nUnder his current circumstances, a clearance is not warranted. In the future, he may well \ndemonstrate persuasive evidence of his security worthiness. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.d: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, I conclude \nthat it is not clearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant or continue \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance.

The \nDepartment of Defense (DoD) sent him a Statement of Reasons (SOR) dated November \n23, 2022, alleging security concerns under Guideline I and Guideline G. The DoD acted \nunder Executive Order (Exec.

SOR \u00b6 \n1.b: After the 2018 suicide attempt, he underwent psychiatric treatment and was \ndiagnosed with major depression, recurrent, severe, without psychosis, and alcohol use \ndisorder, severe.

(Item \n4 at 4.) He notes in his Answer his doctor is aware of his continued alcohol use. In his \n2020 security clearance interview he told the investigator as of July 2018 he no longer \nused alcohol. (Item 7 at 8.) During his July 2022 psychological evaluation, he told the \nDoD psychologist he consumed \u201calcohol approximately four times weekly, drinking \nbetween two and five alcoholic beverages each setting, and only drinking more than six \nalcoholic drinks approximately monthly.\u201d (Item 4 at 7.) \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.d-2.f allege alcohol-related arrests. Applicant admits to each incident: \nthe 2015 incident resulted in him being charged with fourth-degree assault; the 2009 \nincident resulted in an arrest for fourth-degree assault and second-degree disorderly \nconduct; and the 2004 DUI arrest. (Item 3 at 29-32, Item 6, and Item 7 at 4-5.) \nSOR \u00b6 2.b states Applicant has experienced adverse personal, professional, and \nfinancial consequences because of alcohol consumption since at least 2003. In addition \nto the three alcohol-related arrests discussed in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.d-2.f, the record shows several \nother professional and personal consequences. He attributes alcohol consumption to \nmissing work due to being hungover; his two suicide attempts in 2005 and 2018; his \nsecond divorce; and his financial problems, including a 2014 foreclosure.

Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec.

These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \nAnalysis \nGuideline I, Psychological Conditions \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 27: \nCertain emotional, mental, and personality conditions can impair judgment, \nreliability, or trustworthiness.

The following disqualifying conditions are applicable in this case: \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under \nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other \nincidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the individual's alcohol \nuse or whether the individual has been diagnosed with alcohol use disorder; \n(c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired \njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed with alcohol \nuse disorder; and \n(d) diagnosis by a duly qualified medical or mental health professional (e.g., \nphysician, clinical psychologist; psychiatrist, or licensed clinical social \nworker) or alcohol use disorder. \nSOR \u00b6 2.a cross-alleges the Guideline I concerns, SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.d, under \nGuideline G. Applicant\u2019s DoD psychological evaluation is the basis for SOR \u00b6 1.a. In this \nevaluation, he acknowledges alcohol abuse in the early 2000s, again in 2012, and in \n2018, as well as associated alcohol-related incidents away from work.

AG \u00b6 22(d) \napplies. \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 23 are applicable: \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or \njudgment; \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive alcohol \nuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and has \ndemonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or \nabstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations; and \n(c) the individual is participating in counseling or a treatment program has \nno previous history of treatment and relapse, and is making satisfactory \nprogress in a treatment program. \nAG \u00b6 23(a) is partially established as noted below. Applicant\u2019s history shows \nnumerous alcohol-related incidents between 2003 and 2018. Insufficient time has passed \nto demonstrate that the behavior is unlikely to recur. The specific conduct concerns \ndetailed in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.d through 2.f are mitigated as a duplication of SOR \u00b6 2.b. The portion \nof SOR \u00b6 2.a that cross-refences SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c and 1.d is mitigated for Applicant as \nduplicative of information also included in SOR \u00b6 2.b. \nAG \u00b6 23(b) is not established. Applicant admits the incidents and acknowledges \nbut he continues to consume alcohol. He provided no statements from his treating doctors \nshowing he has overcome this problem. Insufficient time has passed to demonstrate he \nhas overcome this problem. \nAG \u00b6 23(c) is not established. Insufficient time has passed to demonstrate he has \nmade satisfactory progress in a treatment program. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n   \n \n \n \n         \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n         \n \n         \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guidelines I and G in my whole-person \nanalysis and applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). Because Applicant requested \na determination on the record without a hearing, I had no opportunity to evaluate his \ncredibility and sincerity based on demeanor. See ISCR Case No. 01-12350 at 3-4 (App. \nBd. Jul. 23, 2003). \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guidelines I and \nG, and evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant \nhas not met his burden to establish he has mitigated the security concerns raised by his \npsychological conditions and alcohol consumption. Eligibility for access to classified \ninformation is denied. \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline I:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.f: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline G:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a-1.c: \nAgainst Applicant  \nSubparagraphs 2.d-1.f: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.

In \nMarch 2023, the DOE granted his application for the ICR Plan. Pursuant to the ICR \nPlan, he has been required to pay at least $405.01 per month since April 2023. Since \nMarch 2023, he has paid at least that monthly amount and has paid off one of the seven \nstudent loans listed in the SOR. His plan is to pay his student loan accounts pursuant to \nthe ICR Plan until they are paid in full. He claimed that he will pay these loans off in two \nto three years, which is far earlier than the timeline envisioned by the DOE. After March \n2023, the accounts remained in good standing through the end of the Deferment, and \nthere is no evidence that they are delinquent. The Government\u2019s and Applicant\u2019s 2023 \ncredit reports reflect that the student loans are in good standing.

As of April 2023, he had paid approximately $38,000 to pay off this auto \nloan. He acknowledged that he knew his mother had not been paying his student loans \nin about May 2022 when a DoD investigator referenced them being delinquent. Despite \nthis realization, he continued to concentrate on paying the auto loan because of its \nhigher interest rate and because of the Deferment.

He has been contributing about \n15 percent of his salary to a retirement account that had a balance of about $118,000, \nbut plans on reducing that amount to about 12 percent to have more money to pay \ndown his student loans.

(Tr 23-27, \n37-41, 52-54, 57, 61; AE A, C, E, F, G) \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective within DOD on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR.

This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant\u2019s seven student loans, totaling approximately $37,000, became \ndelinquent in 2019. The loans were delinquent at the onset of the Deferment. The \nDeferment does not excuse previously delinquent student loans. See ISCR Case No. \n20-01527 at 2 (App. Bd. June 7, 2021).

An applicant is not required to show that every debt in the SOR has \nbeen paid, and there is no requirement that a plan provide for payments on all \noutstanding debts simultaneously. ISCR Case No. 14-00504 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, \n2014). Rather, an applicant is required to demonstrate that he or she has \u201cestablished a \nplan to resolve his [or her] financial problems and taken significant actions to implement \nthat plan.\u201d There is also no requirement that the first debts paid in furtherance of a \nreasonable debt plan are the SOR debts. ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2 (App. Bd. May \n21, 2008). Guideline F mitigation does not require the payment of all the SOR debts. \nInstead, it requires that Applicant remove trustworthiness and reliability concerns raised \nby those debts. ISCR Case No. 14-00504 at 3. \nDuring the Deferment, Applicant contacted the DOE to set up a repayment plan \nand has made payments pursuant to that plan. He credibly testified that he would \ncontinue to make the required payments and provided evidence that he has the income \nand funds to make his payments. He also planned to reduce the percentage of his \nincome which he contributes to his retirement account so that he has more income to \ndevote to his student loans. His student loan accounts are in good standing. He credibly \ntestified that he understands that he made a mistake regarding his student loans and \nthat he will not do so again. He paid approximately $38,000 to satisfy another account \nwith a higher interest rate. He acted in good faith to resolve the student loan accounts \nand bring them current. He has no financial delinquencies. Both the above-referenced \nmitigating conditions apply. The financial considerations security concern is mitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. I have also considered his good work \nperformance, his continuing effort to better himself through education, and his volunteer \nactivities. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant \nmitigated the financial considerations security concern. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.g: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance.

In addition, \nApplicant\u2019s program manager attested to Applicant\u2019s trustworthiness, reliability, and \njudgment. (Item 2; FORM Response) \nPolicies \nThe Under Secretary of Defense\u2019s Memorandum of November 19, 2004, treats \nADP positions as sensitive positions, and it entitles applicants for ADP positions to the \nprocedural protections in the Directive before any final unfavorable access \ndetermination may be made. The standard set out in the adjudicative guidelines for \nassignment to sensitive duties is that the person\u2019s loyalty, reliability, and trustworthiness \nare such that assigning the person to sensitive duties is clearly consistent with the \ninterests of national security. AG \u00b6 2.b. \nA person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. \nDecisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the applicant may \ndeliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard sensitive information. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a public trust position, the \nadministrative judge must consider the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the AG. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of \nhuman behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the \nwhole person. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, \nimpartial and commonsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. Under AG \n\u00b6 2(b), \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to [sensitive] \ninformation will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d The Government must present \nsubstantial evidence to establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nE3.1.14. Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). An applicant has the ultimate burden of \ndemonstrating that it is clearly consistent with national security to grant or continue \neligibility for access to sensitive information.   \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe trustworthiness concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial\nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to\nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be\ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other\nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental\nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An\nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to\nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . . . \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise trustworthiness concerns \nunder AG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income tax \nreturns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as required. \nApplicant has a history of being unable to pay her debts. She also failed to file \nher federal and state income tax returns, and pay her taxes, for TY 2015 through 2018, \nas required. The evidence is sufficient to raise AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), 19(c), and 19(f) as \ndisqualifying conditions. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations trustworthiness \nconcerns are provided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay  \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nConditions beyond Applicant\u2019s control contributed to her financial problems. \nThus, the first prong of AG \u00b6 20(b) applies. For the full application of AG \u00b6 20(b), she \nmust provide evidence that she acted responsibly under the circumstances. Although \nshe stated that she has met with an IRS agent to resolve her outstanding tax issues, \nshe has not demonstrated that she filed her relevant federal and state income tax \nreturns or made any arrangements with the IRS or the state tax authority to pay her \noutstanding taxes. She has not yet made efforts to address her delinquent student \nloans, and there is no evidence in the record about whether her payments are paused \nunder the COVID-19 relief for federal student loans. There is also no evidence in the \nrecord that she received financial counseling. I find that Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties \ncontinue to cast doubt on her current reliability, trustworthiness, and judgment. AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n20(a), 20(b), 20(c), 20(d), and 20(g) do not apply. \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse  \nAG \u00b6 24 expresses the security concern pertaining to drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse as: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. \nAG \u00b6 25 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. I considered the following relevant: \u201c(a) any substance misuse . . .\u201d; \u201c(c) \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nillegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, processing, \nmanufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of drug paraphernalia\u201d; and \n\u201c(g) expressed intent to continue drug involvement and substance misuse, or failure to \nclearly and convincingly commit to discontinue such misuse.\u201d \nApplicant used and purchased THC with varying frequency from 2018 to 2022. \nAlthough she stated in her FORM response that she expected to wean herself off THC, \nshe had yet to find a medication effective at controlling her symptoms for her to no \nlonger use THC. AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a), 25(c), and 25(g) apply. \nAG \u00b6 26 provides the following potentially relevant mitigating conditions: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: . . . \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug\ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future\ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security\neligibility. \n \n \n \nApplicant has not established a pattern of abstinence, as she used THC from \n2018 to as recently as 2022, and only began transitioning from cannabis to her recently \napproved prescription medication for her chronic migraines as of her FORM Response. \nShe did not provide a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement \nand substance misuse. She also kept open the possibility of using THC again in the \nfuture if her prescription medication was ineffective at managing her symptoms. I find \nthat AG \u00b6\u00b6 26(a) and 26(b)(3) are not established. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a public trust position by considering the totality of the \napplicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should \nconsider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \npublic trust position must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline H and Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Overall, the record evidence \nleaves me with questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to sensitive \ninformation. I conclude Applicant did not mitigate the drug involvement and financial \nconsiderations trustworthiness concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.c: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline H: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a public trust \nposition. Eligibility for access to sensitive information is denied. \nCandace Le\u2019i Garcia \nAdministrative Judge \n7 \n",

As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. \nAdministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n  \n \n \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02- \n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01- \n20700 at 3 (App. Bd.

The record reflects Applicant had been residing \nand working in Z for approximately nine months when she stopped making payments on \nher debts in the Spring of 2021, which was at the same time she hired the Firm. Hiring \nthe Firm demonstrated she was trying to act responsibly under the circumstances. The \nbankruptcy of the Firm was a condition largely beyond her control, which partially \nimpacted her ability to resolve her debts. She promptly pivoted after the Firm\u2019s bankruptcy \nand initiated settlement agreements, but she has not established a track record of debt \npayments on the settlement agreements. Those SOR debts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.j, 1.k, 1.l, 1.m, \n1.u, and 1.v) with a documented payment history have been mitigated. \nAG \u00b6 20(c) is not established.

Prior to the Firm filing for bankruptcy in March 2023 \nthere had been no debts settled by the Firm. After the Firm\u2019s bankruptcy Applicant sought \nsettlement agreements, but she has not established a track record of debt payments. Her \nresolution of the debts at SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.k and 1.l occurred only because of legal action against \nher by the creditor. \nAfter approximately a year in her new position Applicant had delinquent debts \ntotaling over $184,000 (See AG \u00b6 20(e) reduction) and has mitigated or resolved by court \naction just over $16,500 of the total debt. Even if an applicant has paid his or her debts, \nan administrative judge may still consider the circumstances underlying the debts for what \nthey may reveal about the applicant\u2019s eligibility for a clearance. ISCR Case No. 14-02394 \n(App. Bd. Aug. 17, 2015.) \nAG \u00b6 20(e) is established for SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f-1i, and 1.q. As an authorized user she is \nnot responsible for the debts. \nAG \u00b6 20(g) is established for SOR \u00b6 1.v. Applicant filed her tax returns on time, \nand she is resolving her tax debt through a payment plan. The record reflects she was \nresolving her tax debt before she received the SOR. \nWhole-Person Concept \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n         \n   \n \n    \n                   \n    \n                     \n                   \n              \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis \nand applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). Because Applicant requested a \ndetermination on the record without a hearing, I had no opportunity to evaluate her \ncredibility and sincerity based on demeanor. See ISCR Case No. 01-12350 at 3-4 (App. \nBd. Jul. 23, 2003). After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under \nGuideline F and evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude \nApplicant has not mitigated the security concerns raised by her delinquent debts. \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \n Paragraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a, 1.f-1.j, 1.m, 1.q, and 1.u-1.v: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.b-1.e, 1.n-1p, and 1.r-1.t: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nEligibility for access to classified information is denied \nCharles C.

Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 \n2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set out, \nin relevant part, in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . .  \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified \ninformation. ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and  \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant incurred a variety of consumer and other delinquencies in recent years. \nThe debts are admitted and established by credit reports in the record. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and \n19(c) apply. \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant\u2019s delinquent debts are ongoing and unresolved. She did not establish \nthat they occurred due to isolated circumstances or that they no longer cast doubt on her \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. AG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply. \nApplicant refers to a variety of circumstances that impacted her family\u2019s finances, \nincluding job and salary changes, family changes, and a health situation in 2015. \nHowever, she did not provide enough details for me to find that her finances were \nimpacted by circumstances beyond her control. Moreover, she did not establish that she \ntook reasonable action under the circumstances to address her debts.

She asserted that some of the debts in the SOR (and in the debt \nservice) are now current. Yet she provided no details and no corroborating documentation \nabout the debt service, nor did she provide sufficient information to establish that her \ndebts are being resolved or are under control. AG \u00b6 20(c) does not apply. \nWhether through the debt-relief service or otherwise, Applicant did not establish \nthat she has undertaken good-faith efforts to pay or resolve her delinquent debts. This is \ntypically accomplished by documentary evidence of a track record of steady payments \ntowards her debts. Applicant did not provide sufficient evidence of such information. AG \n\u00b6 20(d) does not apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(a), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances \nsurrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-\nperson analysis. \nSince Applicant did not request a hearing, I did not have the opportunity to question \nher about her debts, her efforts and ability to resolve them, or about her overall financial \nstability. I also did not have the opportunity to view her demeanor and thus to assess her \ncredibility. She did not provide any documentation with her SOR response and did not \nrespond to the FORM, so she provided no additional evidence in mitigation. Applicant did \nnot provide sufficient evidence to mitigate the security concern shown by her delinquent \ndebts. This does not mean that she cannot show such evidence in the future should she \nreapply for access to classified information. Overall, the record evidence leaves me with \nquestions and doubts as to her eligibility for a security clearance. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.l:  \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented, it is not clearly consistent with the \ninterests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified \ninformation.

Administrative Judge \nBased upon a review of the case file, pleadings, and exhibits, Applicant did not \nmitigate drug and personal conduct concerns. Eligibility for access to classified \ninformation or to hold a sensitive position is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn September 26, 2022, the Department of Defense (DoD) Consolidated \nAdjudications Facility (CAF) issued a statement of reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing \nreasons why under the drug involvement and substance misuse and personal conduct \nguidelines the DoD could not make the preliminary affirmative determination of eligibility \nfor granting a security clearance, and recommended referral to an administrative judge to \ndetermine whether a security clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or \nrevoked. The action was taken under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960); Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program, DoD Directive 5220.6 (January 2, 1992) \n(Directive); and Security Executive Agent Directive 4, establishing in Appendix A the \nNational Security Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to \nClassified Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AGs), effective June 8, \n2017. \n1 \n\n \n \n                                                                                                                                             \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n                                           \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                                                                                \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant responded to the SOR on October 7, 2022, and elected to have his case \ndecided on the written record, in lieu of a hearing. Applicant received the file of Relevant \nmaterial (FORM) on December 1, 2022 and interposed no objections to the materials in \nthe FORM. Applicant timely submitted information to supplement the FORM within the \ntime period In his response to the FORM, Applicant incorporated his explanations from \nhis SOR response. To support his claims, he cited his SOR answer with updates through \nDecember 1, 2022, and documented his September 2019 certificate of completion of his \nintensive treatment, his updated December 2022 diagnosis of major depressive disorder \nand Attention Deficit Disorder (ADD), with a stable prognosis with continuing treatment, \nan updated diagnosis and prognosis with a noted history of drugs and alcohol abuse in \nfull sustained remission, and character references. Applicant\u2019s post-FORM submissions \nwere admitted as Items 9-15. The case was assigned to me on January 26, 2023. \n  Summary of Pleadings \nUnder Guideline H, Applicant allegedly (a) used Methamphetamine with varying \nfrequency from about May 2015 to about May 2019; (b) purchased Methamphetamine \nwith varying frequency from about June 2015 to about May 2019; (c) used \nMethamphetamine with varying frequency from about May 2015 to about September \n2019, while granted access to classified information or holding a sensitive position; and \n(d) received treatment at a substance abuse clinic (A Clinic) from about August 2019 to \nthe present, for a condition diagnosed as moderate to severe substance abuse disorder. \nThe allegations covered by Guideline H were cross-alleged under Guideline E.  \nIn Applicant\u2019s response to the Guideline H and the incorporated Guideline E \nallegations, he admitted each of the allegations with explanations and clarifications. He \nclaimed he completed his five-week treatment program for substance abuse in \nSeptember 2019, and continued his treatment sessions until July 2021. He claimed he \nhas cut ties with all drug-using associates and has surrounded himself with others who \nare clean and in recovery. He also claimed to have been clean and sober from drugs and \nalcohol for three years and four and a half months, and attends one to three 12-step \nmeetings a day. He claimed his willingness to submit to random drug testing. And, he \nclaimed to have maintained a security clearance since approximately 1984 with no \ninfractions or issues. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is a 63-year-old civilian for a defense contractor who seeks a security \nclearance.

(Item 8) He confirmed he as bean \nusing Crystal Meth since the Spring of 2015 to help him with his Attention Deficit \nDisorder (ADD). (Item 8) Soon after his introduction to the drug, he became addicted to it \nand experienced health issues he believed were exasperated by his use of Crystal Meth. \n(GE 8) He assured that his last use of the drug was in September 2019. To obtain his \nCrystal Meth, he furnished funds three or four times a month to sources he found on-line. \n(Item 8) Some of his sources joined him in smoking in his home; while others did not. \n(Item 8) \nAsked for more information about his use of Methamphetamines by the OPM \ninvestigator who interviewed him, Applicant responded that the drug enhanced his \nsexual experiences, which further contributed to his addiction. (Item 8) While he knew it \nwas wrong to use the drug, he became so addicted to using it that he could not abstain. \n(Item 8) Because the Crystal Meth he used helped him focus, he was able to avert \ndetection and defer his obtaining prescribed medications to address his health issues. \n(Item 8) \nUnable to control his use of Crystal Meth, Applicant turned to drug counseling and \ntreatment with A Clinic in August 2019 (Items 3 and 11) As a part of his intensive \noutpatient treatment program, beginning in September 2019, Applicant was treated with \ncomprehensive detoxification, rehabilitation, and continuing care services in a structured, \nintensive outpatient setting. (Item 11) His rehabilitation phase consisted of 20 to 30 \nsessions, spread out over a period of two months, and included group psychotherapy, \nindividual therapy sessions, and daily administration of Antabuse. (Items 11 and 12) \nAfter completing his intensive care outpatient program in September 2019, \nApplicant entered a continuing care phase with the same A Clinic. (Item 11) This phase \nconsisted of at least 20 sessions of group therapy, in addition to Alcoholics Anonymous \n(AA), Controlled Anonymous (CA), and Narcotics Anonymous (NA) meetings. (Item 11) \nApplicant was credited with successfully completing his substance abuse program \nin July 2021 with a discharge diagnosis of amphetamine disorder moderately severe and \nwas urged to continue with individual therapy and participate in community-based \nrecovery support groups.

(Item 9) Applicant has been fully forthcoming with his \nemployer about his past use of Methamphetamines to address his ADD.

(Item 14) \nHealth dangers from Methamphetamine use \nMethamphetamine is a powerful, highly addictive stimulant that affects the central \nnervous system. (Item 4) Crystal Meth is a form of the drug that looks like glass \nfragmented or shiny, bluish-white rocks. Chemically, it is similar to amphetamines, a drug \nused to treat Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHA), as well as narcolepsy, a \nsleep disorder. (Items 4-6) Meth users are at increased risk of contracting infectious \ndiseases, such as HIV and Hepatitis B and C. (Item 4) Methamphetamine uss is known \nto alter decision-making, and it can create cognitive problems in thinking, understanding, \nlearning, and hearing loss. (Item 14) Withdrawal symptoms from Methamphetamine \ncessation include anxiety, fatigue, severe depression, psychosis, and intense drug \ncravings. (Items 4-6) \nApplicant\u2019s updated diagnosis and prognosis \nIn an updated diagnosis and prognosis from a licensed physician affiliated with A \nClinic, this physician diagnosed Applicant with a major depressive disorder and ADD for \nwhich he has been receiving treatment at the A Clinic. (Item 13) This physician noted \nApplicant\u2019s \u201cremote history of drugs and alcohol but is in sustained remission.\u201d (Item 13) \nThe A Clinic physician offered no comments on what continuing treatment and \nmedications Applicant might require to sustain his abstinence from Methamphetamine \nand other illegal drugs for the foreseeable future. Applicant\u2019 supplied no documentation \nof any continuing participation in AA, CA, and NA, or with any continuing care he may \nstill be receiving from substance abuse specialists to ensure his continuing recovery. \nAlthough, he did provide a character reference from his sponsor who has worked with \nApplicant in a 12-Step Book Study group on Zoom.

Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of \nlaw. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe AGs list guidelines to be considered by judges in the decision-making \nprocess covering DOHA cases. These AG guidelines take into account factors that could \ncreate a potential conflict of interest for the individual applicant, as well as considerations \nthat could affect the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified \ninformation. The AG guidelines include conditions that could raise a security concern and \nmay be disqualifying (disqualifying conditions), if any, and all of the conditions that could \nmitigate security concerns, if any. \nThese guidelines must be considered before deciding whether or not a security \nclearance should be granted, continued, or denied. Although, the guidelines do not \nrequire judges to place exclusive reliance on the enumerated disqualifying and mitigating \nconditions in the guidelines in arriving at a decision. \nIn addition to the relevant AGs, judges must take into account the pertinent \nconsiderations for assessing extenuation and mitigation set forth in \u00b6 2(a) of the AGs, \nwhich are intended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and impartial, commonsense \ndecision based on a careful consideration of the pertinent guidelines within the context of \nthe whole person. The adjudicative process is designed to examine a sufficient period of \nan applicant\u2019s life to enable predictive judgments to be made about whether the applicant \nis an acceptable security risk. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s conduct, the relevant guidelines are to be \nconsidered together with the following \u00b6 2(d) factors: (1) the nature, extent, and \nseriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other \npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation of the conduct; (8) the potential for \n5 \n\n \n \n                                                                                                                                             \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \nViewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following individual \nguidelines are pertinent herein: \n   Drug Involvement \n \n           \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n       \n \n \n \n                                                        \nThe Concern: The illegal use of controlled substances, to include \nthe misuse of prescription drugs, and the use of other substances that \ncause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner inconsistent \nwith their intended purpose can raise questions about an individual\u2019s \nreliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may lead to \nphysical or psychological impairment and because it raises questions \nabout a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and \nregulations. Controlled substance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d as \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. 802.

Applicant\u2019s involvement with \nillegal drugs raise security concerns over whether Applicant\u2019s actions reflect pattern \nMethamphetamine use and involvement incompatible with the judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness requirements for gaining access to classified information. \nDrug involvement concerns \nApplicant\u2019s admissions of using Methamphetamine raise security concerns over \nrisks of recurrence as well as judgment issues. On the strength of the evidence \npresented, three disqualifying conditions (DCs) of the AGs for drug involvement apply to \nApplicant\u2019s situation: DC \u00b6\u00b6 25(a), \u201dany substance misuse\u201d; 25(c), \u201cillegal possession of \na controlled substance, including cultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or \ndistribution; or possession of Illegal drugs or drug paraphernalia\u201d; and 25(f), \u201cany illegal \ndrug use while granted access to classified information or holding a sensitive position.\u201d \nTo his credit, Applicant has committed to abandoning all involvement with \nMethamphetamine and has committed to intensive outpatient treatment and participation \nin support groups (AA, CA, and NA meetings) with the support of his sponsor. For over \nthree \nyears, \nhe \nhas \nremained \nabstinent \nfrom \nillegal \ndrugs \n(inclusive \nof \nMethamphetamine) and exhibits no manifest signs or indications of succumbing to any \nrisks or pressures he might encounter to return to illegal drug use in the foreseeable \nfuture. To help him with his focus issues in the future, he will continue to look other types \nof medications to address his ADD issues and avoid any recurrent returns to self-\nmedicating with \nMethamphetamine. Applicant\u2019s \nefforts and commitments are \nencouraging. \nRecognizing his need to set a better example for himself, his coworkers, and his \nfamily he has abandoned illegal drugs and charted a sustained recovery course that \nhopefully will enable him to sustain his abstinence from Methamphetamine. Overall, he \n7 \n\n \n \n                                                                                                                                             \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nhas shown marked improvement in his judgment and maturity level in the three-plus \nyears he has abstained from Methamphetamine use and purchases and disassociated \nfrom individuals known for their involvement in illegal drugs. \nApplicant\u2019s \nassurances \nof \nsustained \nabstinence \nfrom \nillegal \ndrugs \n(Methamphetamine) are welcomed. And, his efforts warrant partial application of three \nmitigating conditions (MCs) of the drug involvement guideline: MC \u00b6\u00b6 26(a), \u201cthe \nbehavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened under such unusual \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current \nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment\u201d; 26(b), \n\u201cthe individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, \nand has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; (2) changing \nor avoiding the environment where drugs were used; and (3) providing a \nsigned statement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, acknowledging that any future involvement or misuse \nis grounds for revocation of national security eligibility .  .  .\u201d; and  \n26(d), \u201csatisfactory completion of a prescribed drug treatment program, including, but \nnot limited to, rehabilitation and aftercare requirements, without recurrence of and \nfavorable prognosis by a duly qualified medical professional.\u201d \nStill, with the combination of addictive use of Chrystal Meth over an extended \nperiod (over four years) while holding a security clearance and his constructive \nawareness of the federal ban on the use of illegal drugs during his years of usage, it is \nstill too soon to absolve Applicant of risks of recurrent use of illegal drugs in the \nforeseeable future. Without additional time to establish a more probative pattern of \nsustained abstinence from the use and purchase of Methamphetamine, none of the \npertinent mitigating conditions are fully available to Applicant at this time. \nWith only three-plus years of demonstrated abstinence from a very addictive drug \n(Methamphetamine), Applicant will require additional time with more corroborating \nevidentiary sources to support his continued abstinence before he can be absolved of \nrecurrence risks. Potentially helpful to Applicant in making his case for sustained \nremission would be earned chips from his AA, CA, NA networks commemorating his \nsustained commitments to long-term recovery from Methamphetamine addiction. \nBecause Applicant\u2019s addictive use of Crystal Meth for many years (2015-2019) \nwhile holding a security clearance violated federally controlled bans on the use and \npossession of the substance, his involvement with the drug falls within the applicable \ncontours of Guideline E as well. Applicant\u2019s habitual use of Crystal Meth while holding a \nsecurity clearance is clearly incompatible with the general concerns expressed in \nGuideline E about an applicant\u2019s failure to comply with rules and regulations, and how \nsuch failed compliance can create questions about the applicant\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive information.

His laudatory endorsements from his group leader and friends while impressive, \nare not enough to counter his history of addictive drug use while holding a security \nclearance. While this is not a close case, even close cases must be resolved in the favor \nof the national security. See Dept. of Navy v. Egan, supra. Quite apart from any illegal \ndrug concerns the Government may have for the clearance holder employed by a \ndefense contractor, the Government has the right to expect good judgment and \ntrustworthy behavior or sustained periods of time from the trust relationship it has with \nthe clearance holder. See Snepp v. United States, 444 U.S. 507, 511n.6 (1980) \nWhole-person assessment \nFrom a whole-person perspective, Applicant has failed to establish enough \nindependent probative evidence of his overall maturity, good judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness required of those who seek eligibility to hold a security clearance or \nsensitive position. \nWhile Applicant presents with many positive reinforcements from his group leader \nand friends, of his overall reliability and trustworthiness, he lacks a sufficient track record \nof sustained avoidance of recurrent illegal use and purchases of Crystal Meth to facilitate \nsafe predictions he is at no risk of recurrence. \nConsidering the record as a whole at this time, including Applicant\u2019s recognized \ncontributions to the nation\u2019s defense efforts, and granting due weight to the positive \nsteps Applicant has taken to sustain his commitments to avoidance of illegal drug \ninvolvement, there is insufficient probative evidence of sustainable mitigation in the \nrecord at this time to make safe predictable judgments about Applicant\u2019s ability to avoid \nillegal drugs and drug activities in the foreseeable future. \nI have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518 (1988), Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, and the AGs, to the facts and \ncircumstances in the context of the whole person, I conclude drug involvement and \npersonal conduct security concerns are not mitigated.

He failed to address the allegations under Guideline E, which are cross allegations previously alleged. I will adopt Applicant\u2019s admissions to the cross-alleged allegations as his response to the Guideline E allegations as well. His admissions are adopted as findings of fact. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following additional findings of fact. Applicant is 27 years old. He is married for the second time. He served in the U.S. Marine Corps from approximately 2015 to 2019 when he was administratively separated with a general discharge as further explained, infra. He has worked for a defense contractor since June 2020. He has two biological children and a stepchild. He is a high school graduate and has taken some college courses. (Tr. 6, 25-27; GE 1) Under Guideline J, the SOR alleged Applicant was charged in January 2021, with illegal discharge of a firearm, intoxication, and with carrying a dangerous firearm under the influence of alcohol. He entered a plea in abeyance agreement and was sentenced to pay fines and fees, and a term of 12 months\u2019 probation. He was required to abstain from alcohol consumption during his probation. In about September 2018, Applicant, while serving in the Marine Corps, was charged with wrongful use of controlled substances under the Uniform Code of Military J",

The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals \n(DOHA) issued a notice of hearing on May 10, 2023, and the hearing was held as \nscheduled on May 24, 2023. The Government offered exhibits (GE) 1-7, which were \nadmitted into evidence without objection. The Government\u2019s exhibit list and discovery \nletter were marked as HE I and II. Applicant testified and offered two exhibits (AE A-B), \nwhich were admitted without objection. His transmittal email was marked as HE III. \nDOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on June 5, 2023. \nFindings of Fact \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer, he admitted all the allegations under Guidelines J, G, and \nH, in the SOR with some explanation. He failed to address the allegations under \nGuideline E, which are cross allegations previously alleged. I will adopt Applicant\u2019s \nadmissions to the cross-alleged allegations as his response to the Guideline E \nallegations as well. His admissions are adopted as findings of fact. After a thorough and \ncareful review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following additional \nfindings of fact. \nApplicant is 27 years old. He is married for the second time. He served in the \nU.S. Marine Corps from approximately 2015 to 2019 when he was administratively \nseparated with a general discharge as further explained, infra. He has worked for a \ndefense contractor since June 2020. He has two biological children and a stepchild. He \nis a high school graduate and has taken some college courses. (Tr. 6, 25-27; GE 1)  \nUnder Guideline J, the SOR alleged Applicant was charged in January 2021, with \nillegal discharge of a firearm, intoxication, and with carrying a dangerous firearm under \nthe influence of alcohol. He entered a plea in abeyance agreement and was sentenced \nto pay fines and fees, and a term of 12 months\u2019 probation. He was required to abstain \nfrom alcohol consumption during his probation. In about September 2018, Applicant, \nwhile serving in the Marine Corps, was charged with wrongful use of controlled \nsubstances under the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ). As a result of this \ninvestigation, he was administratively separated from the Marine Corps and received a \ngeneral discharge. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.b) \nUnder Guideline G, the SOR alleged Applicant was required to attend an alcohol \neducation class in March 2019. It also cross-alleged the firearm-alcohol arrest from \nJanuary 2021. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a-2.b) \nUnder Guideline H, the SOR alleged Applicant used steroids from September \n2016 to April 2017, while holding a security clearance. It also cross-alleged the \nSeptember 2018 UCMJ offense. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 3.a-3.b) \nUnder Guideline E, the SOR cross-alleged the allegations from SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, \nand 3.a.

He testified that he had access to classified \ninformation at the time of his use. He admitted in his August 2020 security clearance \napplication (SCA) that he used steroids from September 2016 to April 2017. He \nobtained the steroids from another Marine. He claimed that he began using steroids \nbecause he was concerned about being able to meet the required physical fitness \nstandards of the Marine Corps. He also received advice from former Marines whom he \nconsidered mentors. They recommended using steroids. He stated that he has not used \nsteroids since this time frame. (Tr. 24-25, 31, 33-35, 40; GE 1) \nWhile Applicant was investigated and interviewed by the Naval Criminal \nInvestigative Service (NCIS) for his steroid involvement, there is no evidence that he \nwas charged under the UCMJ. He admitted receiving an administrative discharge with a \ngeneral discharge under honorable conditions characterization related to his steroid \ninvolvement. (Tr. 25; GE 1, 4) \nAlcohol Consumption. \nWhen Applicant was interviewed by NCIS regarding his steroid abuse, he also \nadmitted drinking approximately 10 beers the previous weekend at a housewarming \nparty. This information was related to Applicant\u2019s command who ordered him to attend \nalcohol-education classes. Applicant attended the classes. (GE 2; Answer to SOR). \nThe second alcohol-related allegation involves Applicant\u2019s criminal arrest in \nJanuary 2021. He stated that he and his family were at a friend\u2019s apartment complex to \ncelebrate New Year\u2019s Eve. The apartment complex was in a residential area. There was \na vacant field close to the apartment complex that Applicant described as about three \nmiles long. He and his friend had been drinking alcohol that evening. At approximately \nmidnight, Applicant and his friend fired a small caliber rifle into the air three to four times \nto celebrate the new year. A neighbor called the police and Applicant was cited for gun \nand alcohol violations, upon which he later entered a plea agreement, supra. (Tr. 36-37; \nGE 1-3, 6-7) \nDrug Involvement and Substance Misuse. \nAs stated supra, Applicant admitted illegal steroid use sometime between \nSeptember 2016 and April 2017. He was an active-duty Marine then and had access to \nclassified information. His use, while a Marine, resulted in his administrative discharge \nwith a general discharge. He stopped using steroids in 2017.

He is described as an effective team player. He makes an outstanding \ncontribution to the team\u2019s productivity. He documented that he complied with the terms \nof his probation and his 2021 gun and alcohol charges were dismissed. He testified that \nhe has had no further involvement with law enforcement since his January 2021 arrest. \n(Tr. 44; AE A-B) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(a), the entire process is a careful weighing of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours.

Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for criminal conduct is set out in AG \n\u00b6 30: \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability \nor willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations. \nAG \u00b6 31 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) a pattern of minor offenses, any one of which on its own would be \nunlikely to affect a national security eligibility decision, but which in \ncombination cast doubt on the individual\u2019s judgment, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness; and \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the person was formally charged, formally prosecuted or \nconvicted. \nApplicant was investigated for and admitted illegal steroid abuse while in the \nMarine Corps. He was arrested in 2021 on gun and alcohol charges. Both of the above \nconditions apply. \nI have also considered all of the mitigating conditions for criminal conduct under \nAG \u00b6 32 and considered the following relevant: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nand does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment; and \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited \nto the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \nApplicant\u2019s steroid abuse happened in 2018, and might otherwise be mitigated \nbecause of the passage of time, except for his 2021 arrest, which makes his 2018 \nactions relevant. The common theme with both incidents was Applicant\u2019s bad judgment. \nHe admitted he let others, whom he considered mentors, convince him to use steroids. \nThis demonstrates his poor judgment. He continued to show poor judgment when he \nand a friend engaged in celebratory gunfire, in a residential area, while consuming \nalcohol as recently as 2021. While he successfully completed his probation term in July \n2022, it is too soon to say whether he has been successfully rehabilitated. I cannot \nconclude that additional crimes are not likely to recur in the future. His actions cast \ndoubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. AG \u00b6\u00b6 32(a) and \n32(d) do not fully apply. \nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption \nAG \u00b6 21 expresses the security concern pertaining to alcohol consumption: \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about \nan individual's reliability and trustworthiness. \nAG \u00b6 22 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under \nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or \nother incidents of concern, regardless of whether the individual is \ndiagnosed with alcohol use disorder. \nThe allegation stating Applicant was required to attend an alcohol education \nclass does not state a disqualifying condition and SOR \u00b6 2.a is resolved in favor of him. \nApplicant\u2019s arrest in 2021 on gun charges also involved his use of alcohol at the time. \nAG \u00b6 22(a) applies to SOR \u00b6 2.b. \nI have also considered all of the mitigating conditions for alcohol consumption \nunder AG \u00b6 23 and found the following relevant: \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, \nor judgment.  \nApplicant had no further alcohol incidents after his 2021 arrest. He successfully \ncompleted his one year probation, which included abstention from alcohol. AG \u00b6 23 (a) \napplies to SOR \u00b6 2.b. \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Abuse \nAG \u00b6 24 expresses the security concern pertaining to drug involvement: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" \nas defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term \nadopted in this guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nAG \u00b6 25 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. Those that are potentially applicable in this case include: \n(a) any substance misuse; and \n(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or \nholding a sensitive position. \nApplicant used illegal steroids at various times between 2016 and 2017, while in \nthe Marine Corps and having access to classified information. AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a) and AG 25(f) \napply. \nAG \u00b6 26 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. One \npotentially apply in this case: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. \nApplicant used illegal steroids anywhere from six weeks to several months \nbetween 2016 and 2017. He was discharged from the Marine Corps because of his use. \nHe has not used illegal steroids since 2017. His use of steroids was infrequent and he \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nno longer needs to meet Marine fitness standards, so there is no reason for him to start \nusing steroids again. AG \u00b6 26(a) applies. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct  \nThe security concern for personal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 15, as follows: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying condition is potentially applicable: \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-\nperson \nassessment \nof \nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual may not \nproperly safeguard classified or sensitive information. \nApplicant\u2019s steroid involvement and arrest on gun charges demonstrate his poor \njudgment over time. His administrative discharge from the Marine Corps should have \nsent a powerful message that he needed to use better judgment. His arrest in 2021 is \nevidence that he did not respond to that message. His conduct reflects questionable \njudgment and an unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations. AG \u00b6 16(c) is not \nperfectly applicable because that conduct is sufficient for an adverse determination \nunder the criminal conduct guideline. However, the general concerns about \nquestionable judgment and an unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations \ncontained in AG \u00b6\u00b6 15 and 16(c) are established. \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following \nis potentially applicable: \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment. \nThe analysis under Guideline J applies equally here.

The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I considered Applicant\u2019s military \nservice and his performance appraisals. However, I also considered that he repeatedly \nexercised poor judgment and failed to follow established rules and laws. Applicant failed \nto provide sufficient evidence to mitigate the criminal conduct and personal conduct \nsecurity concerns. \nOverall the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns under Guidelines J and E. \nHe mitigated the concerns under Guidelines G and H, or those concerns were not \nestablished. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline J: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline G: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a - 2.b: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 3, Guideline H:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 3.a - 3.b: \nFor Applicant \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nParagraph 4, Guideline E:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 4.a - 4.c: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

This is his first application for a security clearance. \nHe earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2009. He has never married, and he has no children. \n(Transcript (Tr.) at 14-18, 51-52; GE 1) \nIn 2009, Applicant uploaded his resume on a job-search website. He received an \nemail from what he thought was a financial consulting company. He responded and a \ntelephonic interview was arranged. During the telephonic discussion, the caller (Ms. C) \nasked Applicant to set up a limited liability company (LLC) and open a bank account in \nthe LLC\u2019s name. Ms. C or someone she represented would deposit $15,000 into the \nbank account. Applicant would keep $500, withdraw the rest, and send it by Western \nUnion to an unidentified location. Applicant would also receive an additional $2,000 per \nmonth. Ms. C told him to withdraw the money from different branches and send the \nmoney through different Western Union locations. (Tr. at 19-53; Applicant\u2019s response to \nSOR; GE 2) \nWhen he initially responded to the email, Applicant thought it was legitimate. By \nthe time he agreed to the plan, he realized it was an illegal money laundering scheme. \nHe did not know if the money was going to terrorists, a drug cartel, organized crime, or \nsome other illegal entity, and he did not care. He admitted that he was greedy and did \nnot care who benefitted from the scheme. (Tr. at 21-24, 53; Applicant\u2019s response to \nSOR; GE 2) \nApplicant submitted a Questionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86) in \nAugust 2020. He answered \u201cNo\u201d to a question under Section 29 that asked, \u201cHave you \nEVER associated with anyone involved in activities to further terrorism?\u201d (GE 1) \nApplicant was interviewed for his background investigation on February 23, 2021, \nand again on February 26, 2021. He was asked if he conducted any wire transfers. He \ndiscussed his telephone conversation with Ms. C. He described the wire transfers as \npart of a legitimate business venture, when he knew it was not. After being confronted \nby the investigator with inconsistencies, Applicant admitted that he had attempted to \nconceal the actual nature of his conversation with Ms. C. He admitted to the investigator \nthat he quickly realized that it was not a legitimate business venture, but rather an \nunscrupulous or illegal money wiring scheme. He told the investigator that he did not \nhave concrete proof, but he thought the money was going to ISIS. He admitted that his \nactions were solely motivated by greed.

He attempted to call Ms. C and alert her to the \ndevelopments, but her phone had been disconnected. He had no further \ncommunications with her. (GE 2) \nApplicant told the background investigator in February 2021 that he was \ncontacted by the U.S. Secret Service about three to four months after the last attempted \ntransfer. He stated that the Secret Service told him that the funds went to ISIS. He \ndownplayed his involvement in the scheme to the Secret Service, and he was never \ncharged with anything. (GE 2) \nApplicant contacted the background investigator and indicated he had additional \ninformation. On February 26, 2021, he told the investigator that the Secret Service \nnever actually told him the money went to ISIS, and that the only thing the Secret \nService would confirm is that the money went to an Eastern European country. \nApplicant reaffirmed that it was only a \u201cgut\u201d feeling that the money went to ISIS. (Ge 2) \nThe two interviews in February 2021 were summarized in reports of investigation \n(ROIs). Applicant certified the ROIs were accurate in September 2022. He initially \ntestified that the Secret Service provided some indication to him that Ms. C represented \nsomeone in \u201cthe Middle East and overseas.\u201d (Tr. at 27) He later testified that the Secret \nService did not inform him that the money went to the Middle East, and that it went to an \nEastern European country. He stated that he surmised the funds might have gone to \nISIS or the Middle East because the Secret Service was investigating the transactions. \nHe stated that he was honest to the bank manager, in the police report, and to the \nSecret Service. He also stated that he provided the Secret Service with all his emails \nand electronic communications with Ms. C. (Tr. at 29-40, 46-47, 52-53; GE 2) \nApplicant admitted, without explanation, all the SOR allegations. His testimony \nwas inconsistent with parts of the ROIs. He testified that he did not intentionally provide \nfalse information on his SF 86 or during his background interview. He stated that he told \nthe interviewer that the information that Applicant received was false, and the \ninterviewer misinterpreted his statements to mean that Applicant intentionally provided \nfalse information.

Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline A, Allegiance to the United States \nThe security concern for allegiance to the United States is set out in AG \u00b6 3: \nThe willingness to safeguard classified or sensitive information is in doubt \nif there is any reason to suspect an individual\u2019s allegiance to the United \nStates. There is no positive test for allegiance, but there are negative \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nindicators. These include participation in or support for acts against the \nUnited States or placing the welfare or interests of another country above \nthose of the United States. Finally, the failure to adhere to the laws of the \nUnited States may be relevant if the violation of law is harmful to stated \nU.S. interests. An individual who engages in acts against the United States \nor provides support or encouragement to those who do has already \ndemonstrated willingness to compromise national security. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 4. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) involvement in, support of, training to commit, or advocacy of any act \nof sabotage, espionage, treason, terrorism, or sedition against the United \nStates; \n(b) association or sympathy with persons who are attempting to commit, or \nwho are committing, any of the above acts; and \n(c) association or sympathy with persons or organizations that advocate, \nthreaten, or use force or violence, or use any other illegal or \nunconstitutional means, in an effort to: \n(1) overthrow or influence the U.S. Government or any state or \nlocal government; \n(2) prevent Federal, state, or local government personnel from \nperforming their official duties; \n(3) gain retribution for perceived wrongs caused by the Federal, \nstate, or local government; and \n(4) prevent others from exercising their rights under the Constitution \nor laws of the United States or of any state. \nI am not convinced by substantial evidence that the transferred funds went to a \nterrorist organization. I am convinced that Applicant knew he was involved in an illegal \nmoney laundering scheme. He did not know if the money was going to terrorists, a drug \ncartel, organized crime, or some other illegal entity, and he did not care. He admitted \nthat he was greedy and did not care who benefitted from the scheme. It is unnecessary \nto establish that the money went to a terrorist organization and that Applicant knew at \nthe time that it went to a terrorist organization. It is sufficient that Applicant believed it \nwas a real possibility that he was helping to fund a terrorist organization, and he did it \nanyway.

Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \nclearance investigative or adjudicative processes. The following will \nnormally result in an unfavorable national security eligibility determination, \nsecurity clearance action, or cancellation of further processing for national \nsecurity eligibility: \n(a) refusal, or failure without reasonable cause, to undergo or cooperate \nwith security processing, including but not limited to meeting with a \nsecurity investigator for subject interview, completing security forms or \nreleases, cooperation with medical or psychological evaluation, or \npolygraph examination, if authorized and required; and \n(b) refusal to provide full, frank, and truthful answers to lawful questions of \ninvestigators, security officials, or other official representatives in \nconnection with a personnel security or trustworthiness determination. \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying.

Such conduct \nincludes: \n(1) engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the person\u2019s \npersonal, professional, or community standing. \nSOR \u00b6 2.a cross-alleges the allegiance to the United States allegation. \nApplicant\u2019s conduct reflects questionable judgment and an unwillingness to comply with \nrules and regulations. The conduct also created vulnerability to exploitation, \nmanipulation, and duress. AG \u00b6 16(e) is applicable. AG \u00b6 16(c) is not perfectly \napplicable because Applicant\u2019s conduct is sufficient for an adverse determination under \nthe allegiance to the United States guideline. However, the general concerns about \nquestionable judgment and an unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations \ncontained in AG \u00b6\u00b6 15 and 16(c) are established. \nApplicant answered \u201cNo\u201d to a question under Section 29 of his August 2020 SF \n86 that asked, \u201cHave you EVER associated with anyone involved in activities to further \nterrorism?\u201d I am not convinced by substantial evidence that the transferred funds went \nto a terrorist organization. I am therefore not convinced that the answer was false. AG \u00b6 \n16(a) is not established. SOR \u00b6 2.b is concluded for Applicant. \nI am convinced by substantial evidence that Applicant intentionally provided false \ninformation during his background interview when he described the wire transfers as \npart of a legitimate business venture. AG \u00b6 16(b) is applicable. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following \nare potentially applicable: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts;  \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was \ncaused or significantly contributed to by advice of legal counsel or of a \nperson with professional responsibilities for advising or instructing the \nindividual specifically concerning security processes. Upon being made \naware of the requirement to cooperate or provide the information, the \nindividual cooperated fully and truthfully; \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely \nto recur;  \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress; and \n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable \nreliability. \nApplicant provided additional information to the background investigator, but only \nafter he was confronted with the facts. I am not convinced he was completely honest \nduring any stage of these proceedings. \nThe analysis under allegiance to the United States applies equally here. There \nare not many things that carry the same stigma as helping terrorists. Applicant remains \nvulnerable to exploitation, manipulation, and duress. His conduct continues to cast \ndoubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. None of the above \nmitigating conditions are applicable. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guidelines A and E in my whole-person analysis. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant did not \nmitigate the security concerns under Guidelines A and E. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline A: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.a:  \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.b: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.c: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \na security clearance.

The debts are also established by Applicant\u2019s credit reports from \nJanuary 2022, August 2022, and September 2023. After a thorough and careful review \nof the pleadings and evidence submitted, I make the following additional findings of fact. \nApplicant is 61 years old. She is not married, lives with a cohabitant and has \nthree adult children. She completed some community college courses from 1981 \nthrough 1984 and again in 2012, but did not earn a degree. She has been with her \nsponsoring employer since March 2019 and has worked as an inspector since May \n2023. She has never held a security clearance. (GX 1, 6; Tr. 21-25) \nApplicant initially experienced financial difficulties from 2010 through 2015 where, \ndespite consistent employment, she struggled to pay her bills. In April 2016, she \ntransferred from a position with a large company in State A to a new position with the \nsame company in State B. She rented an apartment in State B, but continued to own \nher home in State A. She allowed her son to live in her home in State A at a reduced \nrent. However, the rent and her new salary were not enough to cover the increased \nbills. She withdrew an unrecalled amount from her 401k retirement plan and used credit \ncards in an effort to cover her expenses. (GX 1, 6; Tr. 29-31, 61-62, 76) \nAlthough her financial struggles continued, Applicant was able to purchase a \nvehicle in 2017. Through about February 2018, she continued to work in State B. \nHowever, her monthly bills remained greater than her earnings. She did not like the new \nwork and wanted to be closer to family in State A. She described being overwhelmed \nduring this period. (GX 2-3, 6-7; Tr. 30-32) \nIn about March 2018, Applicant returned to State A. She was unable to transfer \nher position within the company back to State A and resigned. She described being \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nconfident that she could obtain new employment easily. Nevertheless, she experienced \nabout six months of unemployment before securing a part-time position as a substitute \ninstructional aide in about September 2018. This work paid less and was inconsistent, \nresulting in a significant reduction in income. She also lacked health insurance during \nthis period and experienced additional medical expenses. She was unable to pay all of \nher monthly bills. (GX 1, 6; Tr. 27-30, 42-44) \nDuring this time, she withdrew additional funds from her 401k and did not initially \npay the additional taxes and penalties that resulted. (See discussion under SOR \u00b6 1.a \nbelow). By 2019, she could no longer afford the mortgages on her home. Believing the \nbank would seek foreclosure, she abandoned the property, choosing to rent a nearby \napartment instead. No foreclosure actions were ever initiated. (GX 1, 4, 6; AX A; \nTr. 49-52, 79-81) \nEven after Applicant started with her current employer in March 2019, she \ncontinued to struggle to meet her monthly expenditures. Her income was garnished to \npay for taxes on the property that she still owned and personal property taxes for the \nvehicle. Those garnishments were later resolved through the completion of payments. \n(GX 1, 6; Tr. 27-28, 46-47) \nIn August 2022, Applicant accepted a modified loan agreement regarding her first \nmortgage and moved back into her home in State A. However, she has not initiated any \npayments toward the second mortgage. (GX 5, 7; Tr. 80-88) \nThe evidence concerning the specific SOR allegations is summarized below. \nSOR \u00b6 1.a are delinquent federal income taxes totaling approximately \n$9,675. Applicant admitted this debt in her answer to the SOR. She testified that this tax \nrelated to her early withdrawal of 401k funds in 2018 to assist with her move back to \nState A from State B. In late 2021, she initiated a payment plan with the IRS whereby \nan auto-withdrawal of $123 occurs every month. The IRS also offset her refunds from \nsubsequent tax years. Account statements show that, from February 2022 through May \n2023, the balance of her tax debt decreased from $9,675 to $5,467. Applicant stated \nshe intends to continue making monthly payments towards this tax debt. (GX 1, 4, 6; \nAX A; Tr. 49-52) \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.c and 1.f are credit card accounts that were placed for \ncollection or charged off totaling approximately $9,713. Applicant admitted these \ndebts in her Answer to the SOR and stated she would be requesting a settlement \narrangement with each of the creditors. However, she later testified that she had not \nreached out to any of these creditors because she could not afford to make any \npayments.

(Tr. 26-34, 95, 102-105) \nPolicies \nIt is well established that no one has a right to a security clearance. As the \nSupreme Court held in Department of the Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe clearly consistent standard \nindicates that security determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d \n484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988) \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \n\u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have not drawn inferences grounded on \nmere speculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. . . .  \nThe financial security concern is broader than the possibility that an individual \nmight knowingly compromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses \nconcerns about an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to \nprotecting classified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also \nbe irresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified \ninformation. ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) \nThe adjudicative guideline notes several conditions that could raise security \nconcerns under AG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the evidence reflect that she has maintained multiple \ndelinquent accounts and tax debt over several years. All of the above disqualifying \nconditions apply. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nApplicant experienced various financial difficulties since 2010. They increased in \n2016 when she moved to State B and experienced increased monthly bills. After her \nmove back to State A in 2018, she experienced a significant period of unemployment \nand underemployment until starting with her current employer in 2019. Many of her \ndebts alleged within the SOR originate from this period. \nSince securing her current employment, Applicant has made progress toward \nresolving some of her delinquent accounts. She established a payment plan regarding \nher delinquent federal taxes, brought her first mortgage into good standing and resolved \nher utility and cable accounts that were in collection. An additional SOR debt was \nresolved through the completion of a garnishment. \nHowever, Applicant has not issued any payments toward her second mortgage \naccount or communicated with the creditor for over a year. She has also not made any \nrecent effort to resolve her remaining delinquent credit card accounts and medical \ndebts. She testified she lacked funds to resolve these additional accounts, but would \nattempt to resolve these accounts in 2024 when she believed she would have additional \nfunds. Meanwhile, she continued to place a significant amount of her income into her \nretirement. By doing so, she essentially prioritized her retirement over the resolution of \nmany of her long-standing delinquent debts. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), 20(b), and 20(g) are applicable to SOR \u00b6 1.a. Applicant\u2019s tax \nproblems were isolated to 2018 following her early withdrawal of retirement funds. She \nhas since negotiated and maintained a payment plan with the IRS for about two years. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), 20(b), and 20(d) are also applicable to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d, 1.i, 1.k and 1.m. \nThe financial difficulties that followed Applicant\u2019s job change in 2016 and her difficulty in \nobtaining full-time employment in 2018 were conditions largely beyond her control. \nAlthough the resolution of SOR \u00b6 1.d occurred through garnishment, she has since \ntaken responsible action to bring her first mortgage current and resolve these additional \naccounts.  \nHowever, AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), 20(b) and 20(d) are not fully applicable to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, \n1.c, 1.e-h, 1.j, 1.l and 1.n. Although Applicant\u2019s current financial position has sufficiently \nimproved to resolve some of her debts, she has not made any recent attempts to bring \nher second mortgage current or communicate with any of the creditors regarding these \naccounts. Applicant has not shown responsible action in addressing these additional \ndebts. \nAdditionally, while Applicant\u2019s State A tax debt and medical account in collection \nare not alleged in the SOR, they undercut assertions of mitigation as her financial \nissues remain recent and ongoing. After experiencing variable periods of financial \ndifficulties, Applicant has made progress in resolving some of her delinquent debts. \nHowever, those efforts do not fully mitigate the ongoing financial security concerns. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. \nFor over the last decade, Applicant has experienced an extended period of \nfinancial difficulties. She recently made some progress on her debts by resolving her \nfederal tax issues and agreeing to a modification of her first mortgage. She also had a \ncredit card delinquency resolve through garnishment and paid two utility bills. However, \nshe has not communicated with the remaining creditors, including the second mortgage \non her home, for over a year and not established a plan for paying her substantial \nremaining debs. Her statements about intending to pay and actions, to date, are \ninsufficient to establish good-faith, responsible efforts to resolve the financial \nconsiderations security concerns. \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline F and \nevaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has \nnot mitigated the security concerns raised by her ongoing delinquent debts. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.b-1.c: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.e-1.h: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.i: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.j: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.k: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.l: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.m:  \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.n: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant Applicant a security clearance.

After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, testimony, and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant is 37 years old. He completed training as an emergency medical technician in 2005 but was unable to find a job in his field because he did not have experience. He was married from 2005 to 2006, which ended in divorce. He does not have children. He has worked for his current employer, a federal contractor. since January 2022. (Tr. 32-35; GE 1) Applicant testified that in about 2016, after his father passed away, he began consuming alcohol excessively. He would drink to intoxication regularly. He would go to bars and have four to five drinks. He kept a bottle of liquor in his car in case he went out and did not want to pay for expensive drinks at a bar. (Tr. 42-44, 59) Applicant was arrested for driving under the influence of alcohol in March 2021. He took a breathalyzer and recorded .216% and .221%.

I convened the hearing as scheduled on October 26, 2023. The Government \noffered exhibits (GE) 1 through 7. Applicant and two witnesses testified on his behalf. He \noffered Applicant Exhibit (AE) A. There were no objections to any exhibits offered, and \nthey were admitted into evidence. The record was held open until November 7, 2023, to \nallow Applicant to submit additional exhibits. He submitted AE B and C. There were no \nobjections, and they were admitted, and the record closed. DOHA received the hearing \ntranscript on November 2, 2023. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant admitted all of the allegations in the SOR. His admissions have been \nincorporated into the findings of fact. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, \ntestimony, and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact. \nApplicant is 37 years old. He completed training as an emergency medical \ntechnician in 2005 but was unable to find a job in his field because he did not have \nexperience. He was married from 2005 to 2006, which ended in divorce. He does not \nhave children. He has worked for his current employer, a federal contractor. since January \n2022. (Tr. 32-35; GE 1) \nApplicant testified that in about 2016, after his father passed away, he began \nconsuming alcohol excessively. He would drink to intoxication regularly. He would go to \nbars and have four to five drinks. He kept a bottle of liquor in his car in case he went out \nand did not want to pay for expensive drinks at a bar. (Tr. 42-44, 59) \nApplicant was arrested for driving under the influence of alcohol in March 2021. \nHe took a breathalyzer and recorded .216% and .221%. Applicant testified that he had \nconsumed liquor in his vehicle after a difficult day at work. He drank it in a parking lot. \nWhile driving, there was a tire tread in the road, and he swerved and lost control of his \nvehicle. He was told he hit a post but did not recall that he did. He was arrested a short \ntime later at a fast-food restaurant. He admitted he was intoxicated when he was arrested. \nHe also had in his possession some pills that were prescribed to him, but the prescription \nwas expired, and he had put them in a smaller container that was unmarked. (Tr. 44-48; \nGE 1, 2, 3, 4, 5) \nApplicant pled guilty to the DUI offense, and the charge of possession of an \nunmarked expired prescription was withdrawn. He was given 18 months\u2019 probation, a fine, \ncourt-ordered alcohol and drug counseling, and he was required to have an interlock on \nhis vehicle for 12 months. He completed all the terms of the probation. (Tr. 48-49; GE 6; \nAE B) \nApplicant credibly testified that this was a wakeup call for him, and he never wanted \nto spend another day in jail. He essentially stopped consuming alcohol after his arrest \nand has only had three or four drinks since then at family gatherings.

He viewed his arrest \nas a life-changing event. (Tr. 35-40) \nApplicant participated and completed alcohol and drug counseling as mandated \nby the court. He was an outpatient and participated in group therapy. He found it very \nhelpful and was provided alternatives to handing stress. He does not crave alcohol. (Tr. \n57-58; GE 5, 6) \nApplicant testified that he was in a toxic relationship with his fianc\u00e9e during the \ntime he was drinking. His mother was ill and passed away in May 2022. He and his fianc\u00e9e \nbroke up and that has had a positive effect on him. He is an only child, and he inherited \nhis mother\u2019s house. He spends his time working on the house. He also has been in a \nstable relationship for the past six months. His girlfriend does not consume alcohol or \ndrugs. Through his commitment to moderate his consumption he has not had any \nproblems related to alcohol. He does not have any in his house, except some cooking \nwine. He has had no other alcohol-related incidents and does not foresee any in his future \nbecause of his abstinence. (Tr. 38-40, 49-52, 54) \nIn about June 2021, Applicant was prescribed medical marijuana, which is legal in \nthe state where he lives. He would purchase it about twice a month. When he completed \nhis security clearance application (SCA), he did not disclose his use because he viewed \nit as a prescription drug, and it was not illegal in his state. When he was confronted by \nthe investigator, he readily admitted he used medical marijuana and was unaware that it \nwas illegal under federal law. He believed he was answering the drug questions on his \nSCA truthfully. I find he did not deliberately fail to disclose his illegal drug use under \nfederal law. (Tr. 40-42, 50-52; GE 1, 2) \nApplicant testified that he had been using medical marijuana regularly for \nrelaxation, anxiety, to help him sleep, and pain management. He explained that at one \ntime he weighed more than 500 pounds and lost weight through surgery. He developed \nback pain due to his weight and that was one of the reasons for his marijuana use. He \nadmitted he did not stop using it immediately after learning it was illegal because he was \nweaning himself off it. During this March 2022 interview with a government investigator, \nhe said he would prefer not to relinquish his medical marijuana card, and he intended to \nuse marijuana in the future. He also said that he was willing to cease using it to keep his \njob. At his hearing, he credibly stated that he will not use marijuana in the future and will \nfind alternative means for controlling his issues. He stopped using it about six months \nago. He said he is willing to destroy his medical marijuana card and not renew it. He fully \nunderstands the importance of remaining drug free. Applicant credibly testified that his \nlife has turned around, and he is ready to move forward. Post-hearing, he provided a \nshredded copy of his medical marijuana card to show in good faith he did not intend to \nuse marijuana again or renew his prescription. (Tr. 42, 50-51, 54-57; GE 2; AE C) \nTwo witnesses testified on behalf of Applicant. Both have served extensively in law \nenforcement for more than 27 years each, including as detectives, investigators, and \npolice officers. Both have extensive experience in investigating narcotics and alcohol-\nrelated offenses. One was his former supervisor before her retirement and the other is \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \nthe current supervisor of security where he works. They were both aware of his DUI \nconviction. They describe Applicant as a model employee. He was never observed being \nunder the influence of drugs or alcohol. He is a punctual, responsible, reliable, \ndependable, and trustworthy employee. They have seen his commitment to his lifestyle \nchange. He has taken full responsibility for his conduct and has learned from it. They \nbelieve that he made a mistake, and he is worthy of a second chance. (Tr. 17-30) \nApplicant provided a letter from a coworker. She believes Applicant is professional, \nreliable, punctual, honest, friendly, and trustworthy. He is serious and conscientious about \nsecurity and following the rules and policies of the employer. He willingly goes above and \nbeyond what is required in his duties. (AE A) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility, the administrative judge \nmust consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, \nthe adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating \nconditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concerns for personal conduct: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.  \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. I find the following potentially applicable: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \naware benefits or status, determine national security eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \nApplicant testified that when he completed his SCA, he believed that because he \nhad a medical marijuana card issued in a state where it is legal, he did not have to disclose \nthis information on his SCA. He later learned during his background interview that use of \nmarijuana is illegal under federal law. I found his testimony credible and find he did not \ndeliberately provide false information on his SCA. None of the disqualifying conditions \napply and I find in his favor under Guideline E, personal conduct. \nGuideline H: Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for drug involvement and substance \nmisuse is set out in AG \u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations.  \nAG \u00b6 25 provides conditions that could raise security concerns. The following are \npotentially applicable: \n(a) any substance misuse;  \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia; and \n(g) expressed intent to continue drug involvement and substance misuse, \nor failure to clearly and convincingly commit to discontinue such misuse. \nApplicant began using marijuana regularly beginning in about June 2021 after he \nobtained a medical marijuana card. He purchased marijuana about twice a month. At the \ntime he was interviewed by a government investigator in March 2022, he intended to \ncontinue to use marijuana. The above disqualifying conditions apply. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 26 are potentially \napplicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions to overcome the problem, and has \nestablished a pattern of abstinence . . .. \nApplicant credibly testified that he no longer uses marijuana. He is using alternative \nmethods to deal with his anxiety and back issues. He said he did not stop using marijuana \nimmediately when he learned it was illegal under federal law because he was weaning \nhimself off it. He stopped using it about six months ago. I am convinced he will not use it \nin the future. He has shredded his medical marijuana card. Obviously, he could obtain a \nnew one, but I believe Applicant fully understands the importance of remaining drug free. \nApplicant credibly testified that his life has turned around, and he is ready to move \nforward. I have considered all of the evidence and find AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a) and 20(b) apply. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nGuideline G: Alcohol Consumption \nAG \u00b6 21 expresses the security concern for alcohol consumption: \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about \nan individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness.  \nAG \u00b6 22 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. I find the following to be potentially applicable: \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving under the \ninfluence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other \nincidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the individual\u2019s alcohol \nuse or whether the individual has been diagnosed with alcohol use disorder; \nand \n(c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired \njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed with alcohol \nuse disorder. \nAfter Applicant father passed away, he began consuming alcohol in excess and to \nthe point of intoxication frequently from about 2016 to March 2021, when he was arrested \nfor DUI. He pleaded guilty to the DUI. The above disqualifying conditions apply. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom alcohol consumption. I have considered the following mitigating conditions under AG \n\u00b6 23: \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or \njudgment;  \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive alcohol \nuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and has \ndemonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or \nabstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations;  \n(c) the individual is participating in counseling or a treatment program, has \nno previous history of treatment or relapse, and is making satisfactory \nprogress in a treatment program; and  \n(d) the individual has successfully completed a treatment program along \nwith nay required aftercare, and has demonstrated a clear and established \npattern of modified consumption or abstinence in accordance with treatment \nrecommendations. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant credibly testified that his DUI arrest and conviction served as a wakeup \ncall for him, and he never wanted to spend another day in jail.

He does not have any in his house, \nexcept some cooking wine. He has had no other alcohol-related incidents and does not \nforesee any in his future because of his abstinence. I found Applicant\u2019s testimony credible, \nand the above mitigating conditions apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuidelines E, G, and H in my whole-person analysis. \nApplicant met his burden of persuasion. The record evidence does not leave me \nwith questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nFor all these reasons, I conclude Applicant mitigated the security concerns arising under \nGuideline G, alcohol consumption, Guideline H, drug involvement and substance misuse, \nand Guideline E, personal conduct. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline G: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.c: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline H:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.c: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 3, Guideline E:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 3.a: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national security to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance. \nEligibility for access to classified information is granted. \nCarol G.

He \nintends to continue using marijuana in the future. Applicant admitted in his SOR response \nthat he used marijuana during the specified period but denied that he ever stated he had \na clear intention to use marijuana in the future. \nSOR \u00b6 1.b alleges Applicant purchased marijuana on various occasions from \napproximately July 2012 to January 2017.

He did not plan to use marijuana while employed by the government \nand while it remained unacceptable by law. (GE 2) \nApplicant participated in a background interview in November 2017, with a DOD \nauthorized investigator during the course of his security clearance investigation. Applicant \ndiscussed his use and purchase of marijuana from 2012 through 2017. He stated that he \nwill not use illegal drugs in the future because he did not want to jeopardize his security \nclearance and employment with a DOD contractor. He was issued a DOD security \nclearance in February 2018. In October 2022, he reviewed the investigator\u2019s report and \nconfirmed the recounted information was true and accurate. (GE 3; Tr. 14, 18-19) \nIn August 2021, Applicant completed another SCA, and he disclosed that he had \nused marijuana randomly for recreation from July 2012 through August 2020. He listed: \nI do plan to randomly smoke marijuana for recreation in the future, only if it \nbecomes legal and acceptable to do so. I do not plan to partake in marijuana \nuse while unacceptable by law. (GE 1) \nIn October 2021, Applicant participated in another background interview. The DOD \nauthorized investigator asked him what his future intentions were for smoking marijuana \nwhich is illegal under federal law. Applicant stated that he does not plan to use marijuana \nin the future, but he might if he feels like smoking it in the moment. He has smoked \nmarijuana recreationally and casually. He could not state with certainty what he may or \nmay not do in the future. He enjoys creating music and being involved in musical projects \nwhere marijuana is usually involved, and he usually partakes in this type of environment. \nIn October 2022, Applicant reviewed the investigator\u2019s report and confirmed the \nrecounted information was true and accurate. (GE 3; Tr. 14, 19-20) \nDOHA sent Applicant interrogatories about his illegal drug involvement. In October \n2022, Applicant responded to the interrogatories, and he listed that from January 2002 \nthrough October 2022, he had used marijuana on approximately four or five occasions. \nDuring the October 2023 hearing, Applicant stated that he last used marijuana in October \n2022, and he does not intend to use marijuana in the future. (GE 4; Tr. 15-18) \nApplicant testified during the hearing that he has matured over the past few years \nby focusing more on his education and career. He does not intend to use marijuana in the \nfuture. He admitted that he is still involved in the music scene and is frequently around \ncolleagues who use marijuana. Although he may not be able to avoid marijuana in that \nenvironment, he has made his boundaries clear to his colleagues and he does not intend \nto participate in the use of marijuana. (Tr. 20-22) \nApplicant admitted that his employer provided annual security briefings, but he \ncould not recall specifically if there was any information provided about illegal drug use. \nHe acknowledged that he had learned from the training that if he were ever arrested for \nviolating the law, for example, he would need to report that adverse information to the \nfacility security officer (FSO).

Sir, in your subject interview in November \n2017, you said you would not use marijuana in the future because you did \nnot want to jeopardize your security clearance or your job. But you used it \nafter 2017, you used it every year up until October 2022, is that correct? \nAPPLICANT: Yes, based on what I reported there, yes. And what I reported \nis true. \nADMIN. JUDGE BENSON: So, every time you used it after that statement \nyou made, you knew it was wrong, correct? \nAPPLICANT: Yeah, after that statement, yeah, I have to take accountability \nfor any use that happened whether I initiated it or not. (Tr. 25) \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The President \nhas authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicant\u2019s eligibility for \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Clearance \ndecisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \n4 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \nThus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that it is based, in whole or \nin part, on any express or implied determination about applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or \npatriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the \nPresident, Secretary of Defense, and Director of National Intelligence have established \nfor issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 \n(App. Bd. May 2, 1996). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of disproving a \nmitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 \n(App. Bd.

Controlled substance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d as \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in \nthis guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nAG \u00b6 25 provides conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \u201c(a) any substance misuse (see above definition)\u201d; \u201c(c) illegal \npossession of a controlled substance. . ..\u201d; \u201c(f) any illegal drug use while granted access \n5 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n        \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nto classified information or holding a sensitive position\u201d; and \u201c(g) expressed intent to \ncontinue drug involvement and substance misuse, or failure to clearly and convincingly \ncommit to discontinue such misuse.\u201d The record establishes AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a), 25(c), and \n25(g). \nAG \u00b6 25(f) is not established. Applicant held a security clearance; however, there \nis no evidence that he actually had access to classified information. ISCR Case No. 20-\n03111 (App. Bd. Aug. 10, 2022) (discussing access to classified information). There is no \ndefinition in the Directive defining a sensitive position, and the evidence did not establish \nApplicant\u2019s position was sensitive at the time he was possessing and using marijuana.\n \n \nAG \u00b6 26 lists three conditions that could mitigate security concerns: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility; and \n(d) satisfactory completion of a prescribed drug treatment program, \nincluding, but not limited to, rehabilitation and aftercare requirements, \nwithout recurrence of abuse, and a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified \nmedical professional. \nNone of the mitigating conditions fully apply. To his credit, Applicant voluntarily and \ncandidly disclosed his marijuana possession and use during the security clearance \nprocess. In 2017 he could not state with certainty whether he would, or would not, use \nmarijuana in the future. His indecision is especially troubling because he was aware that \nmarijuana use was prohibited by federal law and could jeopardize his security clearance \nand job. During the hearing, however, Applicant stated that he does not intend to use \nmarijuana in the future because he has matured, and he is more focused on his education \nand career. Although his response provides encouraging and positive information, the \nevidence against mitigation is more persuasive at this time. An individual who acts only \nwhen they have been placed on notice that their security clearance is in jeopardy may be \nlacking the judgment and self-discipline in the long term that is expected of security \nclearance holders when they are not facing an immediate threat. \n6 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nPossession of a Schedule I controlled substance is a federal criminal offense. \nSchedules I, II, III, IV, and V, as referred to in the Controlled Substances Act are contained \nin 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 812(c).

An individual\u2019s disregard of federal law pertaining to the use, \nsale, or manufacture of marijuana remains adjudicatively relevant in \nnational security determinations. As always, adjudicative authorities are \nexpected to evaluate claimed or developed use of, or involvement with, \nmarijuana using the current adjudicative criteria.

Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. . . . \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying conditions are potentially applicable: \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single guideline, \nbut which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-person \nassessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack \nof candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other \ncharacteristics indicating that the individual may not properly safeguard \nclassified or sensitive information; \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information, \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with \nrules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual \nmay not properly safeguard classified or sensitive information. This \nincludes, but is not limited to, consideration of: . . . \n(3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations; and \n(e) personal conduct \u2026that creates a vulnerability to exploitation, \nmanipulation, or duress by a foreign intelligence entity or other individual or \ngroup. Such conduct includes: \n(1) engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the \nperson\u2019s personal, professional, or community standing. \nGuideline H allegations \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b are cross-alleged under Guideline E \u00b6 2.a. \nEach of them is established by the record evidence. Applicant\u2019s drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse reflect questionable judgment and an unwillingness to comply with \nrules and regulations. The conduct also created vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, \nand duress. AG \u00b6 16(e) is applicable. AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(c) and 16(d) are not fully applicable \nbecause the alleged conduct is sufficient and is explicitly covered for an adverse \ndetermination under the drug involvement and substance misuse guideline.

He \nacknowledged his misconduct and is remorseful. I find that Applicant is intelligent, candid, \nand unlikely to use marijuana in the future, but his behavior is too recent to overcome the \npersonal conduct security concerns. AG \u00b6\u00b6 17(c) and 17(d) do not apply for the same \nreasons as set forth in the analysis under Guideline H, above. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), \u201c[t]he ultimate determination\u201d of whether to grant a security \nclearance \u201cmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines\u201d and the whole-person concept. My comments under Guidelines H and \nE are incorporated in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under those guidelines but some warrant additional comment. \nApplicant has been fully candid about his involvement with marijuana, and he has \nstated that he does not intend to use marijuana in the future.

Applicant\u2019s lengthy \nperiod of marijuana use while holding a security clearance showed poor judgment and \nunreliability. Despite knowing that marijuana use was illegal under federal law, he made \nthe personal choice to ignore the law in effect which prohibited such use. It is \ndisconcerting that Applicant broke the commitment he made in his 2017 SCA to not use \nmarijuana in the future while it is unacceptable by law. \nIt is well settled that once a concern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s security \nclearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption against granting a security clearance. \nSee Dorfmont, 913 F. 2d at 1401. \u201c[A] favorable clearance decision means that the record \ndiscloses no basis for doubt about an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation.\u201d ISCR Case No. 18-02085 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan. 3, 2020) (citing ISCR Case \nNo. 12-00270 at 3 (App. Bd. Jan. 17, 2014)). \nThis decision should not be construed as a determination that Applicant cannot or \nwill not attain the state of reform necessary for award of a security clearance in the future. \nWith more time without possession or use of marijuana or any other conduct of security \nconcern, and a longer track record of behavior consistent with his obligations, he may be \nable to demonstrate persuasive evidence of his security clearance worthiness. I have \ncarefully applied the law, as set forth in Egan, Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, the AGs, \nand the Appeal Board\u2019s jurisprudence to the facts and circumstances in the context of the \nwhole person. Drug involvement and substance misuse and personal conduct security \nconcerns are not mitigated. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a and 1.b:  \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility \nfor access to classified information.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is 62 years old and he resides with his partner. He has a Master\u2019s in Business Administration. He is employed by a defense contractor as a Senior Facilities Planner. He is seeking to obtain a security clearance in connection with his employment. The SOR alleges that Applicant is indebted to five creditors involving credit card debt totaling approximately $28,434. In his Answer, Applicant admits each of the allegations and provides explanations. A credit report of the Applicant dated December 20, 2022, reflects that each of these debts were at one-time owing. (Government Exhibit 3.) Applicant began working for his current employer in September 2021. Prior to 2014, Applicant was committed to his financial obligations, never overextended himself financially, and he paid his bills on time. Beginning in 2014, and continuing off and on until at least 2021, Applicant encountered extraordinary life events that hindered his ability to meet his financial obligations. To sum up his situation, he experienced a number of serious medical issues that prevented him from working and caused additional financial indebtedness. As a result, he was unable to pay his debts. In August 2014, Applicant suffered from his third hernia injury, a bilateral hernia causing him to be out of work for nearly six months due to the healing process. In February 2015, he suffered complications from his surgery forcing him to be hospitalized for five days, which was diagnosed as an intest",

Applicant submitted five \nPost-Hearing Exhibits, referred to as Applicant\u2019s Post-Hearing Exhibits 41 through 45 \nwhich were admitted into evidence without objection. DOHA received the transcript of \nthe hearing (Tr.) on March 21, 2023. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is 62 years old and he resides with his partner. He has a Master\u2019s in \nBusiness Administration. He is employed by a defense contractor as a Senior Facilities \nPlanner. \nHe is seeking to obtain a security clearance in connection with his \nemployment. \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant is indebted to five creditors involving credit card \ndebt totaling approximately $28,434. \nIn his Answer, Applicant admits each of the \nallegations and provides explanations. A credit report of the Applicant dated December \n20, 2022, reflects that each of these debts were at one-time owing. (Government \nExhibit 3.) \nApplicant began working for his current employer in September 2021. Prior to \n2014, Applicant was committed to his financial obligations, never overextended himself \nfinancially, and he paid his bills on time. \nBeginning in 2014, and continuing off and on until at least 2021, Applicant \nencountered extraordinary life events that hindered his ability to meet his financial \nobligations. To sum up his situation, he experienced a number of serious medical \nissues that prevented him from working and caused additional financial indebtedness. \nAs a result, he was unable to pay his debts. \nIn August 2014, Applicant suffered from his third hernia injury, a bilateral hernia \ncausing him to be out of work for nearly six months due to the healing process. In \nFebruary 2015, he suffered complications from his surgery forcing him to be \nhospitalized for five days, which was diagnosed as an intestinal obstruction. This time \nhe was off work, and without medical insurance, which led him to apply for state \nassistance. He was released from the hospital but was not given an explanation for his \ncondition. He still needed medical treatment. (Applicant\u2019s Exhibits 3A, 3B, 3C, and 4.) \nIn May 2015, Applicant experienced another intestinal obstruction complication \nand was in the hospital emergency room for 12 hours and still the doctors were \nuncertain as to why he was experiencing the condition. From May to June 2015, \nApplicant saw three surgeons who tried to determine the cause and prevention of these \nintestinal obstructions. Applicant underwent a number of tests and scans and two of the \nthree surgeons were unable to find a cause for his condition. Applicant was still unable \nto work. He felt ill all of the time, he could not eat properly, and he lost 55 pounds. He \ndepleted his savings account to pay for some of his financial obligations.

During the surgery he discovered that the \noriginal hernia was done incorrectly, the mesh had come loose and was strangling the \nsmall intestine. For about six months following surgery, Applicant underwent physical \ntherapy, received multiple injections for pain, and managed his PTSD from the traumatic \nevent. (Applicant\u2019s Exhibits 10, 11, and 12.) \nFrom 2016 to 2018, Applicant went back to work but still faced residual pain and \nsuffered from PTSD. \nHe was unable to recover financially, but managed to live \npaycheck to paycheck and paid all of his monthly expenses with minimum payments. \nIn November 2017, Applicant was laid-off of his job due to company downsizing \nand he moved back in with his family who lived out of state. His partner was also laid \noff from her job. By moving back in with his family, Applicant was able to help take care \nof his mother who had breast cancer and went through surgery. She also fell and broke \nher hip. About this same time, Applicant\u2019s partner\u2019s mother was going in for double \nknee surgery. (Tr. p. 55.) At this point, Applicant was soley living on his credit cards. \nMoney was scarce and Applicant used it to buy food, gas, car insurance, utilities, and \nother necessary living expenses. The debts listed in the SOR were last paid in 2017 or \nearly 2018. (Tr. p. 53.) Applicant could not afford to make payments towards these \ndebts. (Applicant\u2019s Exhibits 16 and 17.) \nIn 2019, Applicant moved back to California after securing employment. He \nstated that he had planned to start addressing his debts when COVID hit. As a result, \nhe lost his job, and his partner lost her job. From September 2020 to September 2021, \nApplicant was unemployed. (Applicant\u2019s Exhibits 18A, 18B, and 19.) \nIn September 2021, post-COVID, Applicant was able to secure a job with his \ncurrent employer. He stated that he is now finally getting re-established and has every \nintention of resolving his delinquent debts. In March 2023, Applicant contacted his \ncreditors to set up payment arrangements to resolve his debts. (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit 20.) \nThe following delinquent credit card debt is of security concern: \n1.a. Applicant is indebted to a creditor in the amount of $10,347 for an account \nthat was placed for collection. Applicant used this credit card for living expenses and \nrelated matters. In March 2023, he set up a payment arrangement to settle the debt. \nThe agreement requires that he make six monthly payments of $517.38 to resolve the \ndebt. He stated that he may resolve it sooner when he receives his tax rebate, which \nhe plans to use to pay off the remainder of the debt owing. Applicant made his first \npayment towards the debt on March 6, 2023. (Tr. pp. 67-70, and Applicant\u2019s Exhibits \n25, 26, and 31.) \n1.b.  Applicant is indebted to a creditor in the amount of $8,635 for an account \nthat was placed for collection.  Applicant used this credit card for living expenses and \nrelated matters.

In March 2023, he set up a payment arrangement to settle the debt. \nThe agreement requires that he make three monthly payments of $248.24.

Applicant is indebted to a creditor in the amount of $2,838 for an account \nthat was placed for collection. Applicant used this credit card for living expenses and \nrelated matters. In March 2023, he set up a payment arrangement to settle the debt. \nThe agreement requires that he make six monthly payments of $307.50. He made his \nfirst payment towards the debt on March 6, 2023. (Tr. p. 74-75, and Applicant\u2019s Exhibits \n25 and 30.) \nApplicant\u2019s partner does not work outside the home. She recently underwent \nfoot surgery and incurred costs of $1,900. (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit 24.) She is scheduled \nfor another foot surgery next week. Applicant states that he will pay the costs totaling \napproximately $5,000. He states that he has money to cover these expenses. \nA letter of recommendation from Applicant\u2019s supervisor states that he is a great \nasset to the team who demonstrates great character through his honesty, reliability, \nrespectfulness, trustworthiness, and integrity. (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit 42.) \nLetters of recommendation from professional associates and friends of the \nApplicant attest to his professional nature. They describe him as a man of excellent \ncharacter, who is dependable, courteous, caring, helpful, trustworthy, and responsible. \n(Applicant\u2019s Exhibits 35, 36, 37 and 38.) \nApplicant\u2019s 2022 year-end performance review reflects that he has been a \n\u201cSuccessful Performer\u201d on the job. (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit 41.) \nApplicant\u2019s income tax returns for tax year 2022 shows that he is expecting to \nreceive a refund for a total of $8,242.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for Financial Considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18, as \nfollows: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. Two are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant incurred debt he could not afford to pay. The evidence is sufficient to \nraise the above disqualifying conditions. \nFour Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are \npotentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation, clear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity \ntheft), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n        \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nCircumstances largely beyond the Applicant\u2019s control were responsible for his \nexcessive delinquent indebtedness, namely his major medical issues, numerous doctor \nappointments, multiple surgeries, and a significant period of downtime in order to heal \nthat took several years to resolve, coupled with the consequences of COVID 19 and its \nrestrictions, and his loss of employment. These devastating events significantly set \nback the Applicant\u2019s financial situation and impacted his ability to pay his debts. Until \nrecently, he has not had stable full-time employment and been able to afford to pay his \ndebts. He is now gainfully employed and focused on resolving his debts. He plans to \nuse his 2022 income tax refund to pay his debts. All of his delinquent debts will be paid \noff fairly soon. He has acted reasonably and responsibly under the circumstances. \nApplicant has shown good judgment and reliability. There are clear indications that his \nfinancial problems of the past are being resolved and are under control. \nHe has \ndemonstrated a good-faith effort to resolve his debts. The Financial Considerations \nconcern has been mitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. Over the years, \nApplicant has encountered a series of medical problems that have significantly \nimpacted his indebtedness, his ability to work, and to pay his debts. Through no fault of \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   Conclusion \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nhis own, he was also confronted with Covid and the loss of his employment and was \nunable to afford to resolve his past financial obligations. Since becoming gainfully \nemployed, he has recently set up payment arrangements with each of the creditors set \nforth in the SOR. He has already made his first payment, and he plans to follow through \nwith his commitment each month to move closer to fully resolving his debts. In the \nevent that he does not follow through with his commitment, his security clearance will be \nin immediate jeopardy. However, he has demonstrated that he is responsible and uses \ngood judgment. He meets the eligibility requirement for access to classified information. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has mitigated the Financial Considerations security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a. through 1.e.:  \nFor Applicant \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility \nfor a security clearance.

Department Counsel was ready to proceed on April 26, 2023. The \ncase was assigned to me on May 1, 2023. DOHA issued a Notice of Hearing on June 21, \n2023, scheduling the case to be heard via video teleconference on July 24, 2023. \nI convened the hearing as scheduled. Department Counsel offered Government \nExhibits (GE) 1 and 2, which were admitted without objection. She also provided a \nRequest for Administrative Notice (AN), which is discussed below. Applicant and three \ncharacter witnesses testified. Applicant offered no documentary evidence. (Tr. at 17-20, \n93-94.) \nI kept the record open until August 4, 2023, to give Department Counsel the \nopportunity to brief the issue of whether the country conditions of South Korea raise a \nheightened risk security concern. On July 25, 2023, Department Counsel submitted the \nGovernment\u2019s position on the heightened-risk issue summarizing certain facts set forth in \nAN. I marked her submission as Hearing Exhibit I. On the same day, Applicant submitted \na reply in which he restated his position regarding his employment for a DoD contractor \nand his ties to the United States. I marked his submission as Hearing Exhibit II. DOHA \nreceived the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on July 31, 2023. \nProcedural Ruling \nDepartment Counsel requested in its AN that I take administrative notice of certain \nfacts relating to the Republic of Korea (South Korea). She provided a six-page summary \nof those facts, supported by three U.S. Government documents pertaining to South \nKorea. The documents elaborate upon and provide context for the factual summary set \nforth in the AN. I take administrative notice of certain facts included in the Government \ndocuments attached to AN. These facts are limited to matters of general knowledge, not \nsubject to reasonable dispute. They are set forth in the Findings of Fact, below.

He explained that the Army needed him to serve in South \nKorea. In 1996, he married his high school girlfriend, a South Korean citizen and resident, \nin South Korea. They have three children who were born in South Korea in 1999 and \n2004 (twins). Applicant wrote in the e-QIP that his children are U.S. citizens. In April 2001, \nApplicant was honorably discharged from the Army. He has lived in South Korea since \nthen. In 2011 he began working as an aircraft mechanic for a DoD contractor in South \nKorea. He has not previously held a security clearance. He is seeking national security \neligibility in connection with his employment. (Tr. at 24-26, 32-35, 43-45, 50-51, 56; 79; \nGE 1 at 7-19, 24-27, 35.) \nFor a period, Applicant returned to the United States for an Army Medical Board \ndue to a back injury, but then he returned to continue his service in South Korea in about \n1998 to be with his wife. Applicant became a U.S. citizen in 2000. He claimed in the e-\nQIP that he is not a dual citizen of the U.S. and South Korea, but rather is only a U.S \ncitizen. He claimed that he signed a paper to renounce his South Korean citizenship. He \nand his wife has traveled to the United States for three short periods so that she may \nqualify for a resident alien card. (Tr. at 46-49; GE 1 at 8-9.) \nApplicant\u2019s work commute takes about 90 minutes to two hours each way. He gets \nup at 4:30 am and returns home at 6:30 or 7:00 pm. He describes himself as \u201cjust a normal \ndaddy, 51 years old, overweight, and losing hair.\u201d As a result of his work and commuting \nschedule, he does not socialize with anyone at work. He admitted that, with English as \nhis secondary language, he has difficulty with certain words and struggles sometimes \nwith an English dictionary. (Tr. at 26-27.) \nApplicant commented that one reason he would be reluctant to leave South Korea \nand reside in the United States is that there is no gun violence in South Korea, whereas \nhe believes that the United States has significant safety issues with guns. He also noted \nthat he has no family other than his oldest son in the United States. He testified that at \nhis age, it would be difficult for him to adjust to living in a different country. (Tr. at 85.) \nParagraph 1 - Guideline B, Foreign Influence \nIn his Answer, Applicant admitted without explanation each of the allegations in \nthis paragraph of the SOR. His testimony regarding the allegations was as follows: \nSOR \u00b6 1.a. Applicant, Resident of South Korea Since at least 2001. Applicant has \nonly returned to the United States since 1995 on four brief occasions. (Tr. at 43-49.) \nSOR \u00b6 1.b. Applicant\u2019s Wife, Citizen and Resident of South Korea.

His father-in-law is \ndeceased. Applicant speaks with his mother-in-law by telephone every other month and \nsees her in person once a year. His wife speaks with her mother almost daily. His mother-\nin-law lives about a four-hour drive from Applicant\u2019s home. (Tr. at 26, 55, 91-92; GE 1 at \n27-29.) \nSOR \u00b6 1.e South Korean Bank Account of Applicant\u2019s Wife. Applicant has two U.S. \nbank accounts. He has one account in the United States. He has a second bank account \nthrough DoD, which is overseas. His paycheck is deposited in the DoD bank account as \nU.S. dollars. He withdraws the deposit as cash. His wife then converts the U.S. dollars to \nSouth Korea\u2019s currency and deposits the cash in her South Korean bank account. His \nwife also manages their household finances. The funds in his wife\u2019s account represent \nalmost all of their assets. (Tr. at 57-59, 63.) \nApplicant also has a South Korean bank account, but he has limited funds in that \naccount and intends to close it. He opened this account before he became a U.S. citizen. \nHe has no retirement accounts, but he does pay U.S. Social Security taxes. He does not \nown his home in South Korea. (Tr. at 59-62.) \nParagraph 2 \u2013 Guideline E, Personal Conduct \nSOR \u00b6 2.a Falsification in e-QIP for Failure to Disclose South Korean Bank \nAccount of Applicant\u2019s Wife. Section 20A of the e-QIP asks, \u201cHave you, your spouse, or \nlegally recognized civil union/domestic partner, cohabitant, or dependent children EVER \nhad any foreign financial interests that someone controlled on your behalf?\u201d (Emphasis \nin originally.) Applicant incorrectly answered \u201cNo\u201d to this question. The Government \nalleged in the SOR that his negative response was a deliberate falsification. In the \nAnswer, Applicant admitted this allegation with an explanation. He wrote that he did not \nanswer the e-QIP question correctly because he did not read the question carefully. He \nfurther explained that a South Korean bank account was necessary in his country \nbecause U.S. credit cards and U.S. dollars are not acceptable forms of payments for any \ntransaction in the country. (Answer at 3.) \nAt the hearing, Applicant testified that he did not intend to omit the information \nabout the bank account. He believes that he did not read the entire question and \nmisunderstood what the question was seeking. When the investigator who conducted \nApplicant\u2019s background interview explained the question to Applicant, he understood and \nvoluntarily disclosed his wife\u2019s South Korean bank account.

Applicant\u2019s immediate supervisor has known Applicant for about 15 \nyears. They have a professional and a personal relationship. He believes that Applicant \nis trustworthy and reliable. He does not believe that Applicant has any conflicting loyalties \nbetween the United States and South Korea. Applicant\u2019s higher-level supervisor testified \nthat he has known Applicant for about 15 years. They also have a professional and a \npersonal relationship. He testified that, although Applicant lives in South Korea, his \nallegiance is to the United States. A third witness, a work colleague, stated that he has \nknown Applicant for about 15 years. He testified that Applicant is \u201can outstanding guy\u201d \nand is dedicated and trustworthy. (Tr. at 35-42, 65-69, 79-83.) \nSouth Korea \nApplicant and his wife have significant contact with South Korea. Accordingly, it is \nappropriate to look at the current conditions in that country. North Korea and South Korea \nremain technically at war following a 1953 armistice agreement. Bilateral tensions remain \nmoderately high and have escalated to limited confrontations in the past. In the last \ndecade, provocations by North Korea have included ballistic missile tests, nuclear tests, \nand attacks on South Korea-held territory. In 2022 North Korea has test-launched almost \n40 missiles. Industrial espionage remains a high-profile concern relating to South Korea \nand South Korean companies. North Korean actors have increased their cyber \ncapabilities and efforts in targeting South Korea in recent years. \nSouth Korea is overwhelmingly pro-United States. There are approximately 28,500 \nU.S. troops stationed in the country. Nevertheless, there have been periods of increased \nanti-U.S. sentiment due to high-profile accidents and crimes committed by U.S. service \nmembers. Some incidents have resulted in anti-U.S. protest activity. \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines (AG) list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14 requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants national \nsecurity eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as \nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or sensitive information. \nFinally, as emphasized in Section 7 of Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under \nthis order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest \nand shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d \nSee also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information.) \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration.

I have not drawn inferences based on mere speculation or \nconjecture.  \nAnalysis \nParagraph 1 - Guideline B, Foreign Influence \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Foreign Influence is set out in AG \n\u00b6 6: \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they result \nin divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern if they \ncreate circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or induced \nto help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way \ninconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to pressure \nor coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign contacts and \ninterests should consider the country in which the foreign contact or interest \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nis located, including, but not limited to, considerations such as whether it is \nknown to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or sensitive information or \nis associated with a risk of terrorism. \nGuideline B sets forth nine conditions in AG \u00b6 7 that could raise security concerns \nand may be disqualifying in this case. The following four conditions are potentially \napplicable: \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the individual's \ndesire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing that \ninformation or technology; \n(e) shared living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of citizenship \nstatus, if that relationship creates a heightened risk of foreign inducement, \nmanipulation, pressure, or coercion; and \n(f) substantial business, financial, or property interests in a foreign country, \nor in any foreign-owned or foreign-operated business that could subject the \nindividual to a heightened risk of foreign influence or exploitation or personal \nconflict of interest. \nI note that the mere possession of close family ties with a person in a foreign \ncountry is not, as a matter of law, disqualifying under Guideline B. However, if only one \nrelative is a citizen of a foreign country and an applicant has contacts with that relative, \nthis factor alone is sufficient to create the potential for foreign influence and could \npotentially result in the compromise of classified information. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. \n03-02382 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 15, 2006); ISCR Case No. 99-0424 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 8, \n2001). \nIn this case, Applicant not only has a wife and mother-in-law who are citizens and \nresidents of South Korea, he also has resided there for most of his life. He also has twin \nchildren who are U.S. citizens, but who reside in South Korea with Applicant and his wife. \nHis wife also has a South Korean bank account that holds most of Applicant\u2019s assets. In \naddition, the facts of which I have taken administrative notice regarding the country \nconditions in South Korea also establish that Applicant\u2019s foreign contacts create a \nheightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion. \nThis evidence is sufficient to establish the above potentially disqualifying conditions and \nshifts the burden of persuasion to Applicant to mitigate the security concerns. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 8 provides six conditions that could mitigate security concerns under \nGuideline B, including the following four conditions, which are potentially applicable: \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which \nthese persons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in \nthat country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a \nposition of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, \ngroup, organization, or government and the interests of the United States; \nand \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest; \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation; and \n(f) the value or routine nature of the foreign business, financial, or property \ninterests is such that they are unlikely to result in a conflict and could not be \nused effectively to influence, manipulate, or pressure the individual. \nNone of the above conditions have been established. Applicant currently faces a \nrealistic risk of being placed in a position of having to choose between foreign individuals \nand government and the interests of the United States. His loyalties to his wife and family \nin South Korea are significant and his ties to the United States are limited by the brief \nperiods of time he has lived in the United States and had the opportunity to develop \nrelationships and loyalties there. It is not established that he can be expected to resolve \nany conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest. Applicant\u2019s contacts and \ncommunications with foreign citizens are neither casual nor infrequent. Applicant\u2019s wife\u2019s \nSouth Korean bank account is routine in nature; however, it represents the nearly the \nentirety of their funds, such that it could be used effectively to influence, manipulate, or \npressure Applicant. \nParagraph 2 - Guideline E, Personal Contact \nThe security concerns relating to the guideline for personal conduct are set out in \nAG \u00b6 15, which states: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. \nAG \u00b6 16 describes the following condition that may raise security concerns and \npotentially be disqualifying in this case. \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \naward benefits or status, determine national security eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \nThe Government has not met its burden to prove that Applicant\u2019s omission in the \ne-QIP of his wife\u2019s South Korean bank account in his response to a question about his \nfamily\u2019s foreign financial interests was deliberate. Applicant convincingly established that \nhe misunderstood the question due to his poor English language skills, particularly his \ninability to carefully read and comprehend the lengthy form in English. Most of his \neducation was in South Korean schools and his use of the English language is limited to \nhis work activities. The Guideline E SOR allegation is resolved in favor of Applicant. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s potential for national security eligibility by considering the totality of the \napplicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should \nconsider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national security \neligibility for a security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon \ncareful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \npertinent facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have given significant weight \nto Applicant\u2019s desire as a 20-year-old to immigrate to the United States and to enlist and \nserve in the U.S. Army. I have also weighed his many years of service working for a DoD \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ncontractor using his skills as an aviation mechanic in service of the U.S. military. I have \nalso considered the highly supportive testimony of his superiors and a co-worker. \nHowever, Applicant\u2019s connections to South Korean are extensive. He admitted that he \npromised his then-girlfriend when he immigrated to the U.S. seeking his U.S. citizenship \nthat he would return to be with her. Fortunately for him and his future wife, the U.S. Army \nhad a need for his skills in South Korea, and he was able to return to South Korea as a \nsoldier. At this time, his only connection with the United States is his oldest son, who lives \nand works there. Applicant has not carried his burden of persuasion to mitigate the \nsecurity concerns raised by his personal and family connections to South Korea. Overall, \nthe record evidence raises significant questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s suitability \nfor national security eligibility. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.e:  \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility \nfor a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nJOHN BAYARD GLENDON \nAdministrative Judge \n10 \n",

The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant has a history of financial problems and delinquent debts. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) \nand 19(c) are applicable. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; and \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; \nApplicant had a sales job from 2008 to 2018 in which commissions were a large \npart of his compensation. His sales declined as did his compensation, and he had to \nfind another job. He was unable to pay all of his bills and several debts became \ndelinquent, most prominently the loan that he used to buy a boat. Applicant is credited \nwith resolving several debts before the SOR was issued, and he settled the $416 \ncellular telephone services debt on December 27, 2022. That debt is mitigated. \nThe credit union debt is more problematic. Applicant sold the boat for $18,000, \nbut he did not use any of the proceeds to make a payment to the credit union. His \nfinances are better, but it took him to August 2022 to file his 2018 federal and state tax \nreturns, and he is still paying the state the past-due taxes owed for that tax year. \nAG \u00b6 2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for \nnational security eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d There is \ninsufficient evidence for a determination that Applicant\u2019s financial problems will be \nresolved within a reasonable period. I am unable to find that he acted responsibly under \nthe circumstances or that he made a good-faith effort to pay his debts. His financial \nissues are recent and ongoing. They continue to cast doubt on his current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and good judgment. The above mitigating conditions, individually or \ncollectively, are insufficient to eliminate concerns about Applicant\u2019s finances. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance.

Items 1 through 3 will \nhereinafter be referred to as Government Exhibits 1 through 3. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is 41 years old. He is married and has two children. He is currently \nattending on-line college courses working towards obtaining his Bachelor\u2019s degree. He \nis employed by a defense contractor as an Inspector. He is seeking to obtain a security \nclearance in connection with his employment. \nThe SOR alleges that: a. from July 1998 to about August 2021, Applicant used \nmarijuana with varying frequency; b. from about 2000 to August 2021, Applicant \npurchased marijuana with varying frequency; c. from about April 2018 to about August \n2021, Applicant purchased and used marijuana after having been granted access to \nclassified information; d. in about August 2001, Applicant was charged with possession \nof marijuana. \nApplicant admitted each of the allegations set forth in the SOR. \n(Government Exhibit 1, Applicant\u2019s Answer to SOR.) \nApplicant began using marijuana in high school. Over the years, he has used it \nfor a period, and then stopped for a period, and then started using it again. He has also \npurchased marijuana both in the edible and smoking forms. Applicant normally uses \nmarijuana at home to relax, as he stated that he does not consume alcohol. Applicant \nstated that between 2009 and 2018, he completely abstained from using marijuana. He \nstated that he has stopped using marijuana and last used it in August 2021. \n(Government Exhibit 3.) \nApplicant has worked in the defense industry for about twenty years. He has \nused marijuana with varying frequency for recreational purposes for over twenty years. \nHe began working for his current employer in September 2008. He has also purchased \nmarijuana many times over the course of these years. In 2001, he was charged with \nthe illegal possession of marijuana. On this occasion Applicant was driving home when \nhe was pulled over by the police for not wearing his seatbelt. Applicant had a marijuana \ncigarette in his glove box and was issued a citation. He pled guilty to a misdemeanor \nand was fined $300. (Government Exhibit 3.) \nApplicant first applied for a security clearance in 2009. He was denied a security \nclearance in September 2009, as his interim Secret clearance was revoked. \nHe \nbelieves that he was denied his clearance because he did not turn in the additional \ninformation requested as part of the investigation by the due date. He stated that he \nwas afraid that he would be terminated from his job because of his history, but he was \nnot. Applicant re-applied for a security clearance a year later.

(Government Exhibits 2 and 3.) \nApplicant stated that while working for his current employer, and at times using \nmarijuana, he has had access to classified information, and for about the past eleven \nyears there have been no repercussions from this misconduct. He has maintained \nexcellent credit, and is a homeowner, an active member of his church community, and \nis a soon to be graduate with a bachelor\u2019s degree in Computer Science. (Applicant\u2019s \nResponse to the FORM.) \nTwo letters of recommendation were submitted on behalf of the Applicant, one \nfrom the Vice President of Human Resources, who is also the Facility Security Officer, \nand the other from the President of the company. Both individuals acknowledge that \nApplicant is an excellent and hard-working employee. \nCollectively, they state that \nApplicant has worked for the company for fifteen years. From the beginning, he has \nshown initiative to learn additional job responsibilities and an interest in advancing with \nthe company. He is dependable, punctual, and maintains a heavy caseload. He goes \nabove and beyond to train others in the department, while keeping up with his workload. \nHe started as a machinist and has been promoted to a management position. He has \ndone an outstanding job in his new position, and is well respected by his colleagues. \n(Attachments to Applicant\u2019s Response to the FORM.) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the whole-person concept. The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14, requires the Government to present evidence that \nestablishes controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the \n\u201capplicant is responsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, \nextenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, \nand has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance \ndecision.\u201d \nA person who applies for access to classified information seeks to enter into a \nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline H: Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Drug Involvement and \nSubstance Misuse is set forth at AG \u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" \nas defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term \nadopted in this guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 25 contains three conditions that could raise a security \nconcern and may be disqualifying: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia; and \n(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or \nholding a sensitive position. \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 26 contains conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns. None of the conditions are applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \nand \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were \nused; and \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all \ndrug involvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that \nany future involvement or misuse is grounds for revocation \nof national security eligibility. \nNone of the mitigating conditions are applicable here. It is noted that Applicant \nhas signed a statement of intent to abstain from marijuana use in the future. \nHis \nstatement is not convincing considering the fact that his last use of marijuana occurred \nless than two years ago while having access to classified information. Furthermore, \nApplicant\u2019s history reveals that he has used and purchased marijuana off and on from \nJuly 1998 to about August 2021, a period of well over 20 years. His recent use and \npurchase of marijuana from about April 2018 to about August 2021, after being granted \naccess to classified information shows a character defect. He completely disregarded \nFederal law that prohibits the use of illegal drugs, including marijuana. Given his long \nwork history with defense contractors he knew or should have known that his conduct \nwas illegal and against DoD rules and regulations. His conduct shows immaturity and \nraises questions about his ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and \nregulations. \nHe has not shown the requisite good judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness necessary to be eligible for access to classified information. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nGuideline E- Personal Conduct \nThe security concern for Personal Conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 15: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information.  Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 16. Two are potentially applicable in this case: \n(d) Credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information, \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply \nwith rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the \nindividual may not properly safeguard classified or sensitive information.  \nThis includes, but is not limited to, consideration of: \n(3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations. \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, or duress by a foreign \nintelligence entity or other individual or group. Such conduct includes: \n(1) engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the person\u2019s personal, \nprofessional, or community standing. \nThere are conditions mitigating security concerns under AG \u00b6 17. However, \nnone of them are applicable here. \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely \nto recur; and \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n          \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress. \nApplicant claims that he has now stopped using marijuana. However, in the past, \nhe has stopped using marijuana, and then returned to using it again.  Based upon his \nlong history of drug use, and the fact he has ignored DoD policy and procedure for over \n20 years, there is no strong evidence in the record to show that he will be committed to \na drug-free life-style.  Also, the fact that he has used marijuana after having been \ngranted access to classified information is egregious.  None of the mitigating conditions \nare applicable here. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent \nto which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the \nmotivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, \nexploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuidelines H, and E in my whole-person analysis. Based upon the facts and analysis \nset forth above, Applicant has failed to provide sufficient evidence to demonstrate that \nhe meets the qualifications for a security clearance. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant failed to mitigate the Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse, and \nPersonal Conduct security concerns. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline J: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.d. \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a  \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility \nfor a security clearance.

He pleaded guilty and served a week in jail. He completed the terms of his \nsentence. (Items 3, 4) \nApplicant was interviewed under oath by a government investigator in March 2022. \nIn his response to government interrogatories in November 2022, he authenticated his \nstatement to the government investigator. (Item 4) \nApplicant told the investigator that he began using marijuana in May 2001 and has \nused it almost daily since then. He likes the way it makes him feel. From May 2001 to \n2010 he used it with a friend and other random people at parties. From 2010 to the date \nof his interview, he used it by himself or with his wife or half-brother. His mother also \nsmokes marijuana, and he uses it with her. He does not use it with any others. He \nexplained he uses it nightly to relax and aid with sleep. He believes it helps him sleep and \nalleviates some of his asthma symptoms. (Item 4) \nApplicant further disclosed that he purchases about an ounce of marijuana from \nhis half-brother every two months for about $200. His last purchase, at the time of the \ninterview, was February 2022. He explained his half-brother is not a marijuana dealer but \nbuys it for personal use and sells it to him. (Item 4) \nApplicant does not believe he experiences any specific stressors that cause \ntension and does not believe he suffers from any anxiety or other condition which could \nbe treated by a medical professional in lieu of marijuana. He has not attempted to try \nother techniques to help him relax because marijuana is effective. He is not specifically \nanxious without using marijuana but enjoys the relaxation he gets from using it. (Item 4) \nApplicant explained that his prior place of employment conducted a random drug \ntest in February 2019, and he tested positive for marijuana use. He admitted his use when \nthe positive results were reported. His supervisor expressed surprise at the positive \nresults. He took an online drug education course required by his employer because he \nwas worried he would be fired. He completed the course, and no further action was taken \nby his employer. He has never received any drug treatment. The course he took did not \ninclude a drug assessment, counseling, or treatment. (Item 4) \nApplicant told the investigator that he does not use any other illegal drugs, except \nmarijuana. He does not associate with any other illegal drug users, except his family \nmembers. Marijuana use has not negatively impacted his work, even when he tested \npositive at his work. It does not impact his physical or emotional health, judgment, or \nreliability.

If he was required to choose, he would cease using it to obtain \na security clearance. He said his wife would also stop using it, as she only occasionally \nsmokes marijuana with him.

He said he stopped \npurchasing marijuana over the summer for three and a half months because he did not \nwant to make illegal purchases anymore. A question asked if he had in his possession \nany marijuana? His response was that he had \u201csome flower and a bowl in my garage.\u201d \nHe confirmed that he has been with his wife, mother, and half-brother, who all continued \nto smoke marijuana.

(Item 4) \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he said he stopped smoking marijuana in \nNovember 2022. He disputed that he had access to classified information. He stated at \nthat time a decision had not been made about his security clearance eligibility. If he had \nbeen granted a clearance, he would have stopped smoking immediately. He stated he \nhad stopped smoking for four months and did not plan to continue to use marijuana in the \nfuture. He further stated he made marijuana purchases over the years and the last was \nin September 2022 from a legal dispensary. He said he did not intend to purchase \nmarijuana in the future.

([State] Revised Code Section 3780) \nIn Applicant\u2019s response to the FORM, he denied having access to classified \ninformation. He stated he has been open and honest about his past marijuana use. He \nsaid that during his interview process he expressed that he would stop smoking marijuana \nas a condition of his security clearance decision. He stated that he stopped using \nmarijuana in November 2022. He stated, \u201cThe combination of this process and my kids \ngetting older has brought much-needed awareness to my use. Also, not smoking for \nseveral months has made me realize I don\u2019t need it.\u201d He further stated, \u201cI feel my past \nuse will not affect the future of my ability to handle secure information or my allegiance to \nmy country.\u201d (AE A) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility, the administrative judge \nmust consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, \nthe adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating \nconditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline H: Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for drug involvement and substance \nmisuse is set out in AG \u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of\nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances\nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner\ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an\nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may\nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises\nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules,\nand regulations. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 25 provides conditions that could raise security concerns. The following are \npotentially applicable: \n(a) any substance misuse; \n(b) testing positive for an illegal drug; \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution, or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia; \n(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or \nholding a sensitive position; and \n(g) expressed intent to continue drug involvement and substance misuse, \nor failure to clearly and convincingly commit to discontinue such misuse. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant possessed and used marijuana with varying frequency from about May \n2001 to November 2022. In his SF 86 and in his background interview, he expressed his \nintention to continue to use marijuana. In February 2019, he tested positive for marijuana \nduring a random drug screen by his employer. He was charged with possession of \nmarijuana in 2005, pleaded guilty, and was sentenced. AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a), 25(b), 25(c) and \n25(g) apply. There is insufficient evidence that Applicant had access to classified \ninformation or held a sensitive position while he was using marijuana, as alleged, in part, \nin SOR \u00b6 1.a. AG \u00b6 25(f) does not apply. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate the security concerns \nregarding Applicant\u2019s drug involvement. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 \n26 are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions to overcome the problem, and has \nestablished a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: (1) \ndisassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; (2) changing or \navoiding the environment where drugs were being used; and (3) providing \na signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, acknowledging that any future involvement or misuse is \ngrounds for revocation of national security eligibility; and \n(d) satisfactory completion of a prescribed drug treatment program, \nincluding, but not limited to, rehabilitation and aftercare requirements, \nwithout recurrence of abuse, and a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified \nmedical professional. \nApplicant has a long history of using and purchasing marijuana when it was illegal \nin the state where he lived. I will not consider this fact for disqualifying purposes but may \nconsider it in the application of the mitigating conditions, in making a credibility \ndetermination, and in my whole person analysis. Applicant willingly violated the law for \nmore than 20 years. He also admitted to basically gaming the system by refraining from \nhis regular daily marijuana use before he would start a new job where he knew he would \nbe drug tested. After he took the test, he would resume his marijuana use. This does not \nbode well for considering someone\u2019s trustworthiness for eligibility for access to classified \ninformation or a sensitive position. After completing his SF 86 in January 2022, he \ncontinued to use marijuana. After being interviewed by a government investigator in \nMarch 2022, he continued to use marijuana. He last purchased it in September 2022 from \na state where it is legal. Based on his admissions, he continued to use marijuana almost \ndaily until he completed his government interrogatories in November 2022. In his \nresponse to the FORM, he indicated that he stopped using marijuana in November 2022 \nand does not intend to use it in the future. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nApplicant\u2019s long history of use and relatively recent statement of abstinence is \ninsufficient to apply AG \u00b6 26(a). He admitted that in the past, he would stop his marijuana \nuse so he could secure employment and then resume using marijuana. I am not \nconvinced based on his daily use for more than 20 years that it is unlikely he will use \nmarijuana again. In addition, based on his long history of daily marijuana use, even if he \nhas abstained from use since November 2022, it is an insufficient period to conclude that \nhe is totally committed to abstaining from future marijuana use. His conduct casts doubt \non his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. \nApplicant admits his drug involvement and states he does not intend to use \nmarijuana in the future but has not provided evidence of actions to overcome his habitual \nuse of marijuana. He claims to have established a pattern of abstinence, but also admits \nthat his wife, mother, and half-brothers are users with whom he associates. He has not \nprovided any corroborating evidence to conclude that marijuana is no longer part of his \nlife, that he no longer associates with those who use drugs, that he has changed his \nenvironment to avoid where drugs are being used, or that he has participated in a drug \ntreatment program. I understand the obstacles of having close family members who use \ndrugs and the reality of attempting to disassociate with them. However, Applicant has \noffered no independent evidence of any efforts he has made to create a drug-free \nenvironment. Based on his history, I am not confident that when relatives are present and \nusing marijuana, Applicant will not participate. AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(b) and 25(d) do not apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline H in my whole-person analysis. \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nApplicant failed to meet his burden of persuasion. The record evidence leaves me \nwith questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security \nclearance. For these reasons, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns \narising under Guideline H, drug involvement and substance misuse. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nAgainst Applicant except for the \nlanguage \u201cincluding while granted access to classified information\u201d \nSubparagraphs 1.b-1.d: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nCarol G. Ricciardello \nAdministrative Judge \n9 \n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant admitted to the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a.~1.c. and 1.e. He denied SOR allegations \u00b6 1.d. and 1.f., averring that these two past-due debts were charged off. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant is a 35-year-old potential employee of a defense contractor. He is currently unemployed. (TR at page 19 lines 3~17, and at page 26 lines 14~17.) He is unmarried, and has one child. (TR at page 5 line 9 to page 6 line 11, at page 12 line 9 to page 13 line 20, and at page 20 lines 7~18.) Applicant has about $100,000 worth of stock. (TR at page 22 line 13 to page 24 line 7.) Guideline F - Financial Considerations 1.a. Applicant admits a past-due debt to Creditor A in the amount of about $11,915. (TR at page 19 line 19 to page 21 line 10.) As he has done nothing to address this past-due debt, this allegation is found against Applicant. 1.b. Applicant admits a past-due debt to Creditor B in the amount of about $562. (TR at page 21 line 11 to page 22 line 1.) As he has done nothing to address this past- due debt, this allegation is found against Applicant. 1.c. Applicant admits a past-due judgment debt to Creditor C in the amount of about $5,420. (TR at page 24 lines 8~23.) As he has done nothing to address this past- due debt, this allegation is found against Applicant. 1.d. Applicant denies a past-due debt to Creditor D in the amount of about $3,524.

(Answer.) The case was assigned to me on April 6, \n2023. The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing \non April 11, 2023, scheduling the hearing for June 5, 2023.

He denied \nSOR allegations \u00b6 1.d. and 1.f., averring that these two past-due debts were charged \noff. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make \nthe following findings of fact. \nApplicant is a 35-year-old potential employee of a defense contractor. He is \ncurrently unemployed. (TR at page 19 lines 3~17, and at page 26 lines 14~17.) He is \nunmarried, and has one child. (TR at page 5 line 9 to page 6 line 11, at page 12 line 9 to \npage 13 line 20, and at page 20 lines 7~18.) Applicant has about $100,000 worth of \nstock. (TR at page 22 line 13 to page 24 line 7.) \nGuideline F - Financial Considerations \n1.a. Applicant admits a past-due debt to Creditor A in the amount of about \n$11,915. (TR at page 19 line 19 to page 21 line 10.) As he has done nothing to address \nthis past-due debt, this allegation is found against Applicant. \n1.b. Applicant admits a past-due debt to Creditor B in the amount of about $562. \n(TR at page 21 line 11 to page 22 line 1.) As he has done nothing to address this past-\ndue debt, this allegation is found against Applicant. \n1.c. Applicant admits a past-due judgment debt to Creditor C in the amount of \nabout $5,420. (TR at page 24 lines 8~23.) As he has done nothing to address this past-\ndue debt, this allegation is found against Applicant. \n1.d. Applicant denies a past-due debt to Creditor D in the amount of about \n$3,524. (TR at page 24 line 24 to page 25 line 4.) He avers that debt was charged off, \nwhich is reflected in the SOR and on the Government\u2019s most recent March 2023 credit \nreport (CR). (GX 1 at page 6.) Applicant\u2019s lack of action is not a good-faith effort to \naddress this past-due debt; and as such, this allegation is found against Applicant. \n1.e. Applicant admits a past-due mortgage debt to Creditor E in the amount of \nabout $4,578. (TR at page 24 line 25 to page 25 line 22.) He avers that he is \u201ccurrently \non forbearance\u201d as to this mortgage debt. As this mortgage debt appears as \u201cPast Due\u201d \nin the amount of $6,105 on the Government\u2019s most recent March 2023 credit report (GX \n1 at page 4), this allegation is found against Applicant. \n1.f. Applicant denies a past-due debt to Creditor F in the amount of about \n$13,846. (TR at page 24 line 24 to page 25 line 4.) He avers that debt was charged off, \nwhich is reflected in the SOR and on the Government\u2019s most recent March 2023 credit \nreport. (GX 1 at page 8.) Applicant\u2019s lack of action is not a good-faith effort to address \nthis past-due debt; and as such, this allegation is found against Applicant. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility, the administrative \njudge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief introductory \nexplanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying \nconditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s \nnational security eligibility. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the whole-person concept. The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states the \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nA person who applies for access to classified information seeks to enter into a \nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \nSection 7 of Executive Order (EO) 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall \nbe \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the \nloyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information). \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline F - Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. Three are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nDespite having $100,000 in liquid assets, Applicant has done nothing to address \nhis past-due debts totaling about $39,845. The evidence is sufficient to raise these \ndisqualifying conditions. \nAG \u00b6 20 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I considered \nall of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 including: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAlthough Applicant can attribute his current financial difficulties to periods of \nunemployment, his financial problems are ongoing. Despite having the financial \nwherewithal to address them, Applicant has chosen not to do so. He has not \ndemonstrated that future financial problems are unlikely. Mitigation under AG \u00b6 20 has \nnot been established. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. Overall, the record evidence leaves me with \nquestions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. \nFor all these reasons, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the Financial \nConsiderations security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a~1.f: \nAgainst Applicant \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility \nfor a security clearance.

She earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in August 2018. \nShe has never held a security clearance. She has never married. (Item 2 at 12, 17, and \n32.) \nIn her July 2021 SCA, Applicant denied any illegal drug use or drug activity. She \nlisted a single employer from 2011 to the present. During her personal subject interview \n(PSI), she admitted that she voluntarily used marijuana on several occasions in the seven \nyears prior to certifying her SCA, and detailed various employers and breaks in \nemployment not listed in her SCA. \nSOR \u00b6 1.a: Falsified material facts in response to interrogatories dated \nOctober 27, 2022. Applicant asserted in her interrogatory response that the positive \nurinalyses alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a and 2.b were the result of secondhand smoke inhalation. \nShe provided two Federal reports with her Answer to support her assertion, the first from \nNIDA and the second from the CDC. The NIDA found it was possible in an unventilated \nroom to test positive urine assays in the hours directly following exposure and the CDC \nconsidered that someone using marijuana in a child\u2019s home could result in the child having \ndetectable levels of THC but the CDC does not address whether the THC is detectable \nin the child\u2019s blood or urine stating people exposed to secondhand marijuana smoke can \ntest positive on a urinalysis in the hours directly following exposure studies. (Answer at \n13, 17.) She did not detail how her environment was akin to the studies she provided. \nSOR \u00b6 1.b: Falsified material facts on an SCA dated July 14, 2021, pertaining \nto \u201cSection 23-Illegal Use of Drugs or Drug Activity\u201d when you stated \u201cNo\u201d to \nwhether you had illegally used drugs or controlled substances in the last seven \nyears. Applicant in her Response wrote \u201cYes, I said no on my [SCA] because at the time \nI didn't remember doing any kind of drug.\u201d She notes she admitted to two occurrences of \ndrug use in her PSI which details the various instances where she smoked or consumed \nmarijuana. (Item 4 at 8-9.) In her Response she stated \u201cI said no on my [SCA] because \nat the time I didn\u2019t remember doing any kind of drug. At the time of my interview on page \n8 of the interrogatories I did in fact mention 2 different occurrences.\u201d (Response.) She \nalso had tested positive for marijuana on a urinalysis conducted in March 2021.

Applicant \ndenied this allegation. Applicant was employed by Company A from March 2011 until \nSeptember 2020, when she was terminated for having a firearm on company property. \nShe failed to disclose her employment with Company B from October 2020 to March \n2021. (Item 4 at 7.) In March 2021, she was hired by Company C. (Item 4 at 7.)

She states that she was reinstated with Company A without backpay. (Item \n4 at 6.) In her Response she explains that she was told by her union representative that \nher \u201ctime would be bridged, making it look more like a six-month suspension.\u201d \n(Response.) \nSOR \u00b6 1.d: Tested positive for marijuana in March 2021, during a pre-\nemployment drug screening/urinalysis for a job with Company C, an employment \nactivity that you did not disclose on an SCA executed by you on or about July 14, \n2021. In her Response Applicant denied the allegation on the basis it was a not a \ncompany test but an in-house test. (Response at 2.)  She explains in her Answer and PSI \nthat she had tested positive during the preemployment screening process for Company \nC due to exposure to secondhand marijuana smoke and that Company C had let her \n\u201ccome on board with this explanation.\u201d (Answer at 5; Item 4 at 9, 17.) The investigator \nnoted she hesitated when asked if she had a positive urinalysis test and then she \nresponded yes to testing positive for marijuana. She told the investigator she had been \nexposed to secondhand marijuana smoke. (Item 4 at 9.) She explained in her Response \nthat the sample she provided showed a negative result based on the test\u2019s standards, but \nher employer indicated a laboratory test could be positive because of faint presence. (Item \n4 at 9.) \nSOR \u00b6 1.e: Terminated from employment at Company A in October 2021 after \ntesting positive for marijuana during a urinalysis administered by your employer \nimmediately after being involved in a motor vehicle accident on company grounds \nin September 2021. Applicant in her Response discusses the positive urinalysis. She \nstated that she \u201chates the fact that it happened\u201d and her choice to party showed less than \nperfect judgment. (Response.) She offers that she does not party anymore and now she \ngoes to work and goes home but that \u201csometimes [she] might relax with close friends, but \nnot that often.\u201d (Response.) \nSOR \u00b6 2.a: On or about March 2021, you tested positive for marijuana on a \nurinalysis test administered by your employer. Applicant admitted this allegation. In \nher Answer she stated she disclosed to Company C she might test positive and noted the \nurinalysis she took \u201cwas barely a positive.\u201d (Answer at 5.) She claimed that she had tested \npositive due to exposure to secondhand marijuana smoke and that Company C had let \nher \u201ccome on board with this explanation.\u201d (Item 4 at 9, 17; Answer at 5.) She provided a \nstatement from Company C stating: \u201cAs per our organization's policies and procedures, \nall prospective employees are required to undergo a thorough pre-employment screening, \nwhich includes a drug screening. However, in the case of [Applicant] her employment \nduration was exceptionally short, spanning only from March 8, 2021, until March 15, 2021. \nGiven the brevity of her employment [Applicant] did not require or undergo the pre-\nemployment drug screening process.\u201d (Response at 12.)  \nSOR \u00b6 2.b: On or about September 2021, you tested positive for marijuana \non a urinalysis test administered by your employer.

In her Answer she \nstated it was possible that she may have consumed an edible at a party. She explained \nthat \u201cat the party people can bring whatever they want, it's not far-fetched to say that some \nof the desserts and food served had a little extra something in it, l would never know, I \ndidn't feel anything, l was already drinking.\u201d She also cited her \u201csweet tooth\u201d and a \nfondness for brownies and noted that she could \u201cdown a whole cookie tray\u201d (Answer at \n5.)

As of the date of this statement of \nReasons, the taxes remain unpaid. In her Answer, Applicant admitted the allegation, \nand said that she had reduced the debt to about $1,800, that she had an arrangement \nwith the IRS to apply her income tax refunds to the debt, that she expected to significantly \nreduce or resolve the remaining debt with her tax year 2022 refund, and if the refund was \ninsufficient to resolve the debt, that she would pay the remaining balance. (Answer at 2, \n6.) She submitted documentary evidence that her income tax overpayments for tax years \n2019 through 2022 were applied by the IRS to her 2017 tax year debt including accrued \npenalties, and that after the IRS applied her $1,346 overpayment for tax year 2022.

She did not provide documentary \nevidence of voluntary payments or of an arrangement or payment plan with the IRS. \n(Answer at 6, 13; Item 4 at 10; Item 5 at 11; Response at 3, 13.)  Based solely upon the \nsignificant reduction in the tax debt through IRS recoupment of her tax refunds I find for \nApplicant on SOR \u00b6 3.a. \nApplicant cites the actions she has done to get her finances and lifestyle in order. \nShe acknowledges she made \u201ca mistake and got stung\u201d and she is \u201cstill feeling the pain \ntoday.\u201d She has \u201ckicked out\u201d the people who lived in her home that were smoking \nmarijuana.

(Response at 5-11, \n14, 15.) \nPolicies \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro.

An applicant \nwho deliberately fails to give full, frank, and candid answers to the government in \nconnection with a security clearance investigation or adjudication interferes with the \nintegrity of the industrial security program. ISCR Case No. 01-03132 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. \n8, 2002). Applicant's false statements were recent and calculated to give her the most \nfavorable hiring profile because they involved the current adjudication of her application \nfor a security clearance. AG \u00b6 17(c) is not established for SOR \u00b6 1.e. The accident in the \nworkplace while having marijuana in her system casts doubt on her reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and good judgment. \nAG \u00b6 17 (d) and AG \u00b6 17 (e) are not established. Applicant after her second positive \nurinalysis, SOR \u00b6 1.e, may have removed the persons who smoked marijuana from her \nhome and stopped partying but there is insufficient time given her actions and \nassociations prior to her second positive urinalysis to mitigate SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d and 1.e. \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d as \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in \nthis guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nApplicant\u2019s admission in her Answer to the SOR and the information in the FORM \nare sufficient to raise the following disqualifying conditions under this guideline: AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n25(a): \u201cany substance misuse (see above definition)\u201d; and (c) \u201cillegal possession of a \ncontrolled substance, including cultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or \ndistribution; or possession of drug paraphernalia.\u201d \nApplicant has not rebutted lack of knowledge. She admitted using marijuana on at \nleast two occasions, tested positive twice, informed the labor relations representative \npresent at the September 2021 urinalysis it was likely that she would test positive for \nmarijuana, lived and associated with marijuana users, consumed edibles that she had \ngood reason to believe contained controlled substances, lied about using marijuana, and \nher passive inhalation claims are not credible. \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 26(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \nhappened under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and \nAG \u00b6 26(b): the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence including, but not \nlimited to: (1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; (2) \nchanging or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; and (3) \nproviding a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement \nand substance misuse, acknowledging that any future involvement or \nmisuse is grounds for revocation of national security. \nAG \u00b6 26(a) is not established. Applicant admitted using marijuana on at least two \noccasions. Additionally, she acknowledged testing positive on two different urinalysis \ntests for marijuana, March 2021 and September 2021 respectively. The second positive \nurinalysis was the result of an ordered urinalysis after her job site accident. She told a \ninformed the labor relations representative she would likely test positive for marijuana, \nand she did. The urinalysis was administered while her July 2021 SCA was being \nprocessed. Her secondhand smoke exposure and innocent ingestion claims are not \ncredible. The Appeal Board has \u201clong held that applicants who use marijuana after having \nbeen placed on notice of the security significance of such conduct may be lacking in the \njudgment and reliability expected of those with access to classified information.\u201d ISCR \nCase No. 20-01772 at 3 (App. Bd. Sep. 14, 2021). See also ISCR Case No. 21-02534 at \n4 (App. Bd. Feb. 13, 2023) (\u201c[A]fter applying for a security clearance and being adequately \nplaced on notice that such conduct was inconsistent with holding a security clearance, an \napplicant who continues to use marijuana demonstrates a disregard for security clearance \neligibility standards, and such behavior raises substantial questions about the applicant\u2019s \njudgment, reliability, and willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations.\u201d) \nThe Appeal Board has also stated the Administrative Judge is tasked to resolve \napparent conflicts in the evidence. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-00281 at 4 (App. Bd. \nDec. 30, 2014). In this case Applicant raises whether she knowingly used or consumed \nmarijuana. Applicant has admitted using marijuana and not disclosing it on her SCA, \nwhich diminishes her credibility. Before her September 2021 urinalysis she told the labor \nrelations representative present she would likely test positive for marijuana, and after \ntesting positive for marijuana, she said that marijuana may have been in an edible or in \nfood she consumed at a party where people were smoking marijuana. I conclude she \neither knew or reasonably should have known or suspected under the circumstances that \nmarijuana was present in the food she consumed. See ISCR Case No. 22-01176 (App. \nBd. Oct. 24, 2023). \nAG \u00b6 26(b) is not established. Applicant acknowledges her use in her PSI. Her \nsupporting documents allow her to make her Response argument that her two positive \nurinalysis tests could have been from exposure to secondhand marijuana smoke.

She stated her \nintention to no longer be associated with marijuana users and her intent to abstain from \nall drug involvement and substance misuse. She did not offer a letter of intent to abstain. \nor evidence of abstinence or actions taken to overcome the problem, except for a general \nletter about care and concurrent therapy the credibility concerns with this Applicant are \nrelevant to uncorroborated pledges. While she is acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security eligibility, she does \nnot precisely incorporate all the terms of AG \u00b6 26(b)(3). \nSomeone who picks and chooses what laws she will follow is not a good candidate \nfor a security clearance. Applicant does not currently hold a security clearance. Her recent \nacknowledgement of her mistakes and poor judgment and assurance she will do \nwhatever it takes to be granted a security clearance does not generate confidence that \nshe has not continued to use illegal drugs or that she will not use them in the future. None \nof the mitigating conditions are applicable, and Applicant\u2019s illegal drug use is not \nmitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nApplicant in her Response provided various character letters, which attested to her \nintegrity, trustworthiness, resiliency, and positive nature, as well as the correspondence \nfrom her therapist, which I have considered. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuidelines E, H, and F in my whole-person analysis and applied the adjudicative factors \nin AG \u00b6 2(d). Because Applicant requested a determination on the record without a \nhearing, I had no opportunity to evaluate her credibility and sincerity based on demeanor. \nSee ISCR Case No. 01-12350 at 3-4 (App. Bd.

The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nclassified information.

Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set out \nin AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence.

It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handing and safeguarding classified \ninformation. See ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) \nApplicant\u2019s credit reports and admissions establish two disqualifying conditions \nunder this guideline: AG \u00b6 19(a): \u201cinability to satisfy debts\u201d, and AG \u00b6 19(c): \u201ca history of \nnot meeting financial obligations\u201d. \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation, clear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity \ntheft), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nAG \u00b6 20(a) is not established. Applicant's delinquent debts are recent, numerous \nand ongoing. She provided no evidence to support the plan in her Answer to resolve her \nstudent loans or provide evidence of payment concerning the other delinquent debts that \nshe indicated would be resolved on or after a specified date. \nAG \u00b6 20(b) is not established. Applicant cited having to replace her car but there \nis no supporting evidence of any circumstances beyond her control in the record. There \nis no evidence that her former boyfriend was responsible for the delinquent utility debts. \nShe did not provide evidence to support her claims that she acted responsibly under the \ncircumstances to resolve her debts. \nApplicant\u2019s financial delinquencies are ongoing and unresolved.

Applicant provided no documentary \nevidence to support her claims. See ISCR Case No. 20-01527 at 2 (App. Bd. Jun. 7, \n2021) She did not establish that her financial problems are in the past and are unlikely to \nrecur. She cites without evidence that she has established a plan to resolve her financial \nproblems. See ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008). She has failed \nto establish that she has made a good-faith effort to pay or resolve her debts. AG \u00b6 20(d) \ndoes not apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis \nand applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). I considered her statements, which she \nattributed to others, concerning her trustworthiness, good judgment, and reliability in my \nwhole-person analysis. Because Applicant requested a determination on the record \nwithout a hearing, I had no opportunity to evaluate her credibility and sincerity based on \ndemeanor. See ISCR Case No. 01-12350 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Jul. 23, 2003). \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline F, and \nevaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has \nnot mitigated the security concerns raised by Guideline F. \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): AGAINST APPLICANT \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.f: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the interests of \nnational security to grant Applicant a security clearance.

He was told by police that the downloads occurred in December 2020, which \nwas right when he moved out of the home and allowed his daughter and fianc\u00e9 and \ntheir new baby to move in.

He asserted that his daughter\u2019s fianc\u00e9\u2019s \n12-year-old son had admitted downloading the images. (Answer) \nApplicant asserted that he pled guilty because there was a guarantee of no \nprison time, and no further action would be taken. A trial would risk the jury that \u201cwould \nwant to go after him just based off of the charges\u201d and the risk that he would be seen to \nbe \u201ctrying to throw [his grandson] under the bus to stay out of trouble.\u201d (Answer) \nIn his FORM Response, Applicant again said that \u201cI never downloaded any \nmaterial such as I was accused.\u201d He acknowledged downloading adult pornography \nfrom age-verified sites and he would delete any images of any females who looked \nyounger (16-18). He said he would never download \u201csomething that was of a child.\u201d \n(i.e., child pornographic images). He asserted that during the investigation he was \nconcerned that it may have been his son-in-law or grandson (then age 12) who had \ndownloaded the images, and that the grandson admitted weeks later that he had \ndownloaded the images but deleted them for fear of getting into trouble. Applicant said \nhe took a plea because of the risk of jail time and of possible charges against his \ngrandson.

Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988). \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision.

This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nAnalysis \nIn April 2021, Applicant was charged in State 1 with possession of obscene \nmaterial. The exact criminal statute he was charged with violating is not clear from the \nrecord. However, in January 2023, he pled guilty to the offense charged and received a \n10-year jail term. That sentence was suspended, and he was placed on two years of \nprobation, until January 2025. Applicant was also required to register as a sex offender. \n(SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 2.a, 3.a) \nThe doctrine of collateral estoppel generally applies in DOHA hearings and \nprecludes applicants from contending that they did not engage in criminal acts for which \nthey were convicted. ISCR Case No. 95-0817 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Feb. 21, 1997). There \nare exceptions to this general rule, especially with respect to misdemeanor convictions \nbased on guilty pleas. Relying on federal case law, the DOHA Appeal Board has \nadopted a three-part test to determine the appropriateness of applying collateral \nestoppel to criminal convictions. First, the applicant must have been afforded a full and \nfair opportunity to litigate the issue in the criminal trial. Second, the issues presented for \ncollateral estoppel must be the same as those resolved against the applicant in the \ncriminal trial.

Federal courts recognize that an individual may not have an incentive to \nfully litigate a misdemeanor offense because there is less at stake or because a plea \nbargain creates a disincentive to litigate the issues. ISCR Case No. 04-05712 (App. Bd. \nOct. 31, 2006). \nApplicant denies the SOR allegation and the cross-allegations. He also asserts, \nin various ways, that he did not download any child pornography or inappropriate \nimages of minor children. He asserts at various points that his son-in-law or his minor \ngrandson did it, and that the child admitted doing so when asked about it by his parents. \nEven so, Applicant pleaded guilty to a felony, for which he received a 10-year \nsuspended jail term. Having done so, he is barred from claiming in this forum that he did \nnot engage in the felony criminal conduct to which he pleaded guilty. \nIndeed, according to the police report, Applicant was asked about specific photos \nwith sexually explicit descriptions referencing girls aged 9, 11, and 12. According to the \npolice report, Applicant said he \u201cwould download it to see what it was and then delete \nit.\u201d (Item 4 at 3) This admission cuts against his assertions that he did not engage in the \nalleged criminal conduct. \nThe Government has met its burden in this case. Notwithstanding Applicant\u2019s \ndenials, the SOR allegations are established. Specific disqualifying conditions, as \napplicable, are discussed below. \nGuideline D: Sexual Behavior \nAG \u00b6 12 expresses the security concern for sexual conduct: \nSexual behavior that involves a criminal offense; reflects a lack of \njudgment or discretion; or may subject the individual to undue influence of \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress. These issues, together or individually, \nmay \nraise \nquestions \nabout \nan \nindividual's \njudgment, \nreliability, \ntrustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive information. \nSexual behavior includes conduct occurring in person or via audio, visual, \nelectronic, or written transmission. No adverse inference concerning the \nstandards in this Guideline may be raised solely on the basis of the sexual \norientation of the individual. \nAG \u00b6 13 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying conditions are potentially applicable: \n(a) sexual behavior of a criminal nature, whether or not the individual has \nbeen prosecuted; \n(c) sexual behavior that causes an individual to be vulnerable to coercion, \nexploitation, or duress; and \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n(d) sexual behavior of a public nature or that reflects lack of discretion or \njudgment. \nThe definition of sexual behavior under the Guideline D general concern \n\u201cincludes conduct occurring in person or via audio, visual, electronic, or written \ntransmission.\u201d I find that accessing and downloading sexually explicit images of children \nsatisfies this definition. I find that AG \u00b6\u00b613(a) and 13(c) apply, as does AG \u00b6 13(d), \nsince Applicant\u2019s conduct reflects a serious lack of judgment, even though it was not \npublic. \nAG \u00b6 14 sets forth potentially applicable mitigating conditions for sexual conduct, \nincluding: \n(b) the sexual behavior happened so long ago, so infrequently, or under \nsuch unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or judgment; \nand \n(c) the behavior no longer serves as a basis for coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; \nApplicant\u2019s actions put him in position where he might have been subject to \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress. As he notes, however, his employer\u2019s security \ndepartment is aware of the charges, as is his family. The possibility of coercion is also \nlessened by the fact that he pleaded guilty. His arrest is also a matter of public record. \nThus, AG \u00b6 14(c) has some application. \nAG \u00b6 14(b), however, is not applicable. Applicant engaged in the conduct as \ncharged as recently as late 2020 or early 2021, pleaded guilty in January 2023, and \nremains on probation, facing a possible 10-year jail term if his probation is revoked, until \nJanuary 2025. He was also required to register as a sex offender. This means that the \nState 1 criminal authorities do not trust him to be out in society without restrictions. As \nnoted below, being on probation is itself a disqualifying condition under Guideline J. \nApplicant has not established that his conduct \u201chappened so long ago, so infrequently, \nor under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or judgment.\u201d AG \u00b6 14(b) does not \napply. Guideline D security concerns are not mitigated. \nGuideline J: Criminal Conduct: \nAG \u00b6 30 expresses the security concern for criminal conduct: \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness.

He was sentenced to ten years in jail, suspended \nfor two years, and was sentenced to two years of probation. He was also required to \nregister as a sex offender. AG \u00b6\u00b6 31(b) and 31(c) both apply to SOR \u00b6 2.a, the criminal \nconduct cross-allegation of Guideline D \u00b6 1.a in the SOR. \nAG \u00b6 32 sets forth the potentially applicable mitigating conditions: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment; and \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited \nto, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 32(a) and 32(d) do not apply for the same reasons that Guideline D AG \u00b6 \n14(a) does not apply, as discussed above. In addition, Applicant has repeatedly \nasserted that he did not engage in the felony conduct alleged, despite having pleaded \nguilty to that felony conduct in court. His continued denials undercut any evidence of \nreform and rehabilitation. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 details the personal conduct security concern: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. . . \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying condition is potentially applicable: \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-\nperson \nassessment \nof \nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual may not \nproperly safeguard classified or sensitive information. \nSOR \u00b6 3.a is merely an additional cross-allegation, under Guideline E, of conduct \nalready alleged under Guideline D and cross-alleged under Guideline J. AG \u00b6 16(c) is \nnot established, as it requires \u201ccredible adverse information in several adjudicative \nareas that is not sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \nguideline. . . .\u201d Because the conduct is fully addressed and disqualifying under other \nguidelines, as discussed above, I consider the personal conduct cross-allegation to be \nduplicative, and I find SOR \u00b6 3(a) for Applicant on that basis. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuidelines D, J, and E in my whole-person analysis. \nSince Applicant elected a decision on the written record, in lieu of a hearing, I did \nnot have the opportunity to ask him questions about his conduct. I also had no \nopportunity to observe his demeanor during a hearing, and thus, to assess his credibility \nbeyond the documentary record. The fact that I cannot assess his credibility undercuts \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nthe strength of his denials. Further, when balanced against his guilty plea, his denials \nundercut any acceptance of responsibility and any claim of rehabilitation. \nThe simple fact in this case is that Applicant engaged in serious criminal conduct \nfor which he remains on probation and has had to register as a sex offender. It is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant him eligibility for access to classified \ninformation, because the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline D: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline J:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 3: Guideline E:   \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 3.a:  \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented, it is not clearly consistent with the \ninterests of national security to grant Applicant access to classified information. \nEligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nBraden M.

He has worked for the same employer since 2001. He served on \nactive duty in United States Air Force from 1981 to 2001. He retired with an Honorable \ndischarge.

(Item 2) \nThe SOR alleged nine delinquent debts, with a combined approximate total of \n$120,120, to include:  a $40,281 charged-off account (SOR \u00b6 1.a: Item 4 at 5; Item 3 at \n2); a $32,071 charged-off account (SOR \u00b6 1.b: Item 4 at 3; Item 3 at 2); a $19,242 \ncharged-off credit card account (SOR \u00b6 1.c: Item 4 at 4; Item 3 at 2); a $16,919 charged-\noff credit card account (SOR \u00b6 1.d: Item 4 at 4; Item 3 at 3); a $5,505 charged-off credit \ncard account (SOR \u00b6 1.e: Item 4 at 7; Item 3 at 3); a $4,408 charged-off credit card \naccount (SOR \u00b6 1.f: Item 4 at 6; Item 3 at 3); a delinquent telephone account in the amount \nof $1,076 placed for collection (SOR \u00b6 1.g: Item 3 at 4);  a $318 satellite television account \nplaced for collection (SOR \u00b6 1.h: Item 4 at 4; Item 3 at 4); and a $300 cable television \naccount placed for collection  (SOR \u00b6 1.i: Item 3 at 4). \nApplicant indicated in Section 26 - Financial Record of his February 2022 SCA that \nhis debts became delinquent because he earned significantly less income and his \nfinancial situation was complicated by his 2019 divorce. He hopes to improve his income \nso he can satisfy his debts. (Item 2 at 45-54) \nThe SOR also alleges Applicant failed to file his federal income tax returns for tax \nyears 2018 and 2019. (SOR \u00b6 1.j: Item 2 at 46) He failed to file his state income tax returns \nfor tax years 2018 and 2019. . (SOR \u00b6 1.k: Item 2 at 46) Applicant listed his failure to file \nfederal and state income tax returns in response to Section 26 Financial Record \u2013 Taxes \non his February 2022 SCA. Regarding tax year 2018, he commented that he expected a \ntax refund and just forgot to file. He indicated the filing of his 2019 federal and state tax \nreturns were delayed because of COVID 19 filing extensions. He noted that he expected \na refund and payroll withholding was active throughout the year.

(Item 1) \nApplicant did not provide evidence indicating that he is attempting to pay or resolve \nany of the delinquent debts alleged in the SOR. He also did not provide proof that he filed \nhis federal and state income taxes for 2018 and 2019. His approximate monthly income \nis $7,244, His monthly expenses total $7,177. His total net remainder each month is $67. \n(Item 5 at 6) Based on his monthly budget, he is unable to resolve his delinquent \naccounts. \nPolicies \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d (Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988)). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d (Egan at 527). \nThe President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant \napplicants eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d (EO 10865 \u00a7 2) \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the AG. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, \nrecognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies these \nguidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available and reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d (EO 10865 \u00a7 \n7). Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant has \nnot met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established \nfor issuing a clearance. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. (Egan, 484 U.S. at 531). \u201cSubstantial \nevidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d (See v. Washington \nMetro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994)). The guidelines presume a \nnexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria listed \ntherein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 (App. Bd. \nApr. 20, 2016). Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. (Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15). An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. (ISCR Case No. 02-31154 \nat 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005)) \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d (ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002)). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d (Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; AG \u00b6 2(b)) \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. (ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nAG \u00b6 19 notes several disqualifying conditions that could raise security concerns. \nThe disqualifying conditions that are relevant to Applicant\u2019s case include: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \nAG \u00b6 19(a) and AG \u00b6 19(c) apply to Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts alleged in SOR \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.a \u2013 1.i. The total approximate balance of the delinquent debt is $120,120. AG \u00b6 19(f) \napplies to Applicant\u2019s failure to timely file his federal and state income tax returns for tax \nyears 2018 and 2019 as alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.j \u2013 1.k. \nAG \u00b6 20 describes conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following \nare potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non in the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment:  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;   \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and  \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nAG \u00b6 20(b) applies, in part, because Applicant\u2019s 2019 divorce was a circumstance \nbeyond his control. However, the mitigating condition is given less weight because I \ncannot conclude he acted responsibly under the circumstances because Applicant has \nmade no attempts to resolve any of the delinquent debts. \nNone of the other mitigating conditions apply because Applicant\u2019s financial \nproblems are ongoing. He failed to initiate a good-faith effort to resolve his debts. He has \nnot provided documentation that he filed his 2018 and 2019 federal and state tax returns. \nApplicant bears the burden of production and persuasion in mitigation. While \nApplicant disclosed his delinquent debts on his security clearance application, he took no \naction towards resolving these delinquent accounts. He did not mitigate the concerns \nraised under Financial Considerations. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether the granting or continuing \nof national security eligibility is clearly consistent with the interests of national security \nmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nadjudicative guidelines, each of which is to be evaluated in the context of the whole \nperson. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors \nlisted at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis, \nand I have considered the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). I considered Applicant\u2019s honorable active-\nduty service in the United States Air Force. I considered his divorce adversely affected \nhis finances. However, Applicant failed to show that he made any attempts to resolve his \ndelinquent accounts or to file his federal and state income tax returns for 2018 and 2019. \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline F and \nevaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude that Applicant \nhas not mitigated the security concerns raised under financial considerations. \nAccordingly, Applicant has not carried his burden of showing that it is clearly consistent \nwith the interests of national security to grant him eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by Section \nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.k: \nAgainst Applicant \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the interests of national security to \ngrant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.

(Government Exhibits 4 and 5.) Applicant served in the U.S. Air \nForce from July 1979 to September 1988, and received an honorable discharge. From \nSeptember 1988 to May 2012, Applicant was in the FBI and retired as a Supervisory \nSpecial Agent. He began working part time as a 1099 contractor for a Federal defense \ncontractor in October 2016.

A delinquent debt is owed to a creditor for an account that was charged off in the \napproximate amount of $25,933. The debt remains owing. (Government Exhibits 4 and \n5.) \nIn 1988, Applicant\u2019s house was foreclosed upon. He no longer owns this house. \nIn the spring of 2015, another house of Applicant\u2019s was foreclosed upon. Applicant \nstated that he was told by the lender to stop making payments on the loan, to allow it to \ngo delinquent for 90 days, and then he could obtain a \u201cdeed in lieu of foreclosure\u201d which \nwould prevent him from owing anything more on the loan. (Government Exhibit 7.) \nDuring his personal interview on August 18, 2021, Applicant stated that his \nfinancial situation was good, and that he is willing to repay his debts. (Government \nExhibit 7.) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance \ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to \npotential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F -  Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for Financial Considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. Two are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and   \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant incurred delinquent debt he could not afford to pay. The evidence is \nsufficient to raise the above disqualifying conditions. \nThe following mitigating conditions under the Financial Considerations guideline \nare potentially applicable under AG \u00b6 20; \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g. loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce, or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \nand    \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant has been working part-time with his current employer and security \nclearance sponsor since October 2016. Since March 2017, he has also owned and \noperated a security firm and private investigation company. From the limited evidence \npresented, his debts remain delinquent and owing. Applicant\u2019s inaction for so long \nreflects a pattern of unreliability, untrustworthiness, and poor judgment. Accordingly, \nApplicant does not meet the requirements to access classified information. \nThere is nothing in the record to demonstrate that Applicant has made efforts to \nmitigate the Government\u2019s concerns under Guideline F.

The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nWhile Applicant claims that he has paid off two of his debts, he has submitted no \ndocumentary evidence to support his claims. I considered the potentially disqualifying \nand mitigating conditions in light of all relevant facts and circumstances surrounding this \ncase. I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the Financial Considerations security \nconcerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a. through 1.g. \nAgainst Applicant \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s national \nsecurity eligibility for a security clearance.

After serving honorably in the U.S. Navy from 1997 until \nSeptember 2017, he was hired by his sponsor immediately upon retirement. He received \nan associate degree in 2005. He was married to his first spouse from 1999 until 2013. His \nsecond marriage was from 2014 until 2021. He married again in 2022. He has two \nelementary school age children. (Item 3 at 10, 11, 17-18, 20-21; Item 4 at 22.) \nThe SOR alleges six delinquent debts totaling $14,441, reflected in three credit \nreports from the government from October 2022 (Item 5), March 2022 (Item 6), and \nNovember 2020 (Item 7). Two government credit reports show a charged-off automobile \nloan for over $13,000, which was not alleged. (Item 5 at 7; Item 6 at 4.) In his subject \ninterview, he acknowledges the charged-off automobile loan and stated because of the \ndivorce he stopped making payments after his former spouse hid the keys. (Item 4 at 8.) \nThe SOR did not allege this debt. The evidence concerning these debts is summarized \nbelow. The May 2023 credit report he provided with his Response shows just one SOR \ndebt, SOR \u00b6 1.a. (AE C.) \nAny derogatory information that was not alleged in the SOR will not be considered \nfor disqualifying purposes. However, it may be considered in the application of mitigating \nconditions and in a whole-person analysis. \nGuideline F \nSOR \u00b6 1.a: retail account placed for collection in the amount of $2,652. \nApplicant denies the debt. He reported the account to the Federal Trade Commission as \na fraud. He stated the account had been opened by his former spouse after their \nseparation in late 2019. (Answer at 1, 3 and Item 4 at 8.) The account fraud began in \nNovember 2019, and he did not discover it until June 2022. (Answer at 3.)

(Answer at 3\u00ad\n6.) \nSOR \u00b6 1.e: telecommunications account placed for collection in amount -\nof $2,000. Applicant denies the debt on the basis he has a current account with multiple \nlines with the company, which is not delinquent. He argues how could the account be past \ndue when he has a current account with the company. (Answer at 2.) The account was \nopened in December 2019 and was delinquent in November 2020. (Item 7 at 6.) The \naccount does not appear on the May 2023 credit report. (AE C.) \nSOR \u00b6 1.f: utility account charged off in the amount of $504. Applicant admits \nthe debt.

(Item 7 at 6.)  \nSOR \u00b6 1.g: Applicant filed Chapter 7 bankruptcy in 2016. The bankruptcy \ndischarged $73,156 in debt. (Item 8 at 8.) He admits the action. He cites in his Answer \nthe unexpected passing of his mother that triggered his financial issues. (Answer at 2.) \nHe told the investigator the bankruptcy was caused by travel costs to visit his mother and \nher funeral costs, as well as his then-wife\u2019s medical discharge from the military, which \nreduced their income. (Item 4 at 25.) \nApplicant detailed his expenses in his subject interview, which left him \napproximately $3,200 per month in disposable income. (Item 4 at 10.) The credit report \nhe submitted shows three accounts with negative information, SOR \u00b6 1.a, the previously \nreferenced vehicle loan, and an April 2022 charge off for a credit card.

(AE B.) \nPolicies \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability.

Sep. 22, 2005).  \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set out \nin AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handing and safeguarding classified \ninformation. See ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) \nAfter filing for bankruptcy in 2016 Applicant accrued delinquent consumer debts. \nHis admissions and the evidence in the FORM establish two disqualifying conditions \nunder this guideline: AG \u00b6 19(a): inability to satisfy debts; and AG \u00b6 19(c): a history of not \nmeeting financial obligations. \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially applicable: \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a) and 20(d) do not fully apply. Applicant\u2019s financial delinquencies are \nongoing and unresolved. He discharged in bankruptcy over $73,000 in debt in 2016 and \nhas accrued over $14,000 in new debt. He was employed immediately after his retirement \nin 2017 by his sponsor. His second divorce was in 2020. He formally disputed one marital \ndebt based on fraud. In December 2022 he resolved $1,432 of the alleged debt. It is well-\nestablished that the timing of debt payments is a relevant consideration for a judge in \ndeciding whether an applicant has acted in a reasonable and responsible manner in \naddressing financial problems. To receive full credit under Mitigating Condition AG \u00b6 \n20(d), an applicant must initiate and adhere \u201cto a good faith effort to repay overdue \ncreditors or otherwise resolve debts.\u201d His recent action after receiving the FORM showing \na $100 payment on one debt and resolving two debts only after the SOR was issued is \ninsufficient for the application of this mitigating condition does not receive this mitigating \ncredit. See ISCR Case No. 08-06058 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 21, 2009). He did not establish \nthat he has made a good-faith effort to pay or resolve his debts. \nApplicant attributes his debts to his second divorce. The first prong of AG \u00b6 20(b) \ntherefore applies. For full consideration under AG \u00b6 20(b), however, Applicant must \nestablish that he acted responsibly under the circumstances. He has not done so. He \ncompleted his SCA in December 2021. The most recent record evidence (May 2023 credit \nreport) shows only one alleged debt on the credit report. He addressed two debts, SOR \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.c and 1.d, approximately two weeks after the SOR was issued. An applicant who \nwaits until his clearance is in jeopardy before resolving debts may be lacking in the \njudgment expected of those with access to classified information. See ISCR Case No. \n16-01211 (App. Bd. May 30, 2018) citing ISCR Case No. 15-03208 at 5 (App. Bd. Mar. 7, \n2017). The mere evidence that debts no longer appear on a credit report is not a reason \nto believe that they are not legitimate or that they have been paid. See, e.g., ISCR Case \nNo. 14-03612 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 25, 2015). He did not provide sufficient evidence that \nhe acted responsibly under the circumstances to resolve them.

In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. While Applicant\u2019s financial delinquencies after \nhis divorce are largely attributable to circumstances beyond his control, they remain \nlargely unresolved. Overall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as \nto Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. \nBecause Applicant requested a determination on the record without a hearing, I \nhad no opportunity to evaluate his credibility and sincerity based on demeanor. See ISCR \nCase No. 01-12350 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Jul. 23, 2003). After weighing the disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions under Guideline F and evaluating all the evidence in the context of \nthe whole person, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns raised by \nhis delinquent debts. \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): AGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.b and 1.e-1.g: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.c and 1.d: \nFor Applicant \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the interests of \nnational security to grant Applicant a security clearance.

His admissions are adopted as findings of fact. After a \nthorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following \nadditional findings of fact. \nApplicant is 52 years old. He has worked for his current contractor-employer since \nJanuary 2020. He served in the U.S. Army from 1991 until 2001, when he was honorably \ndischarged. He has worked for various government contractors since his Army discharge. \nHe has taken some college courses. He is divorced and has one adult child. He has held \na security clearance or a public trust position in the past. (Tr. 5, 18-19, 22; GE1-2) \nUnder Guideline E, the SOR alleged that Applicant deliberately gave false \ninformation on his March 2022 security clearance application (SCA) when he failed to \ndisclose that he was fired from a job within the past seven years because of a positive \nurinalysis test (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.b) and his illegal drug use (SOR \u00b6 1.c). It also alleged that \nhe was terminated from his job in April 2019 because he tested positive for marijuana \n(SOR \u00b6 1.d). It alleged that he admitted to a background investigator that he intentionally \nomitted information from his SCA (SOR \u00b6 1.e). It also alleged he used marijuana and \ntested positive for its presence in 1995 or 1996, while possessing a security clearance \n(SOR \u00b6 1.f). Applicant admitted all the allegations during his background interview, in his \nSOR answer, and during his testimony. (Tr. 19-22; GE 2; SOR answer) \nUnder Guideline H, the SOR alleged in April 2019 Applicant failed a urinalysis test \nfor marijuana (SOR \u00b6 2.a); and that he was arrested in August 2003 for unlawful use and \npossession of a controlled substance marijuana (SOR \u00b6 2.b). Applicant admitted all the \nallegations during his background interview, in his SOR answer, and during his testimony. \n(Tr. 19-24; GE 2; SOR answer) \nUnder Guideline J, the SOR cross-alleged the drug allegations stated in SOR \u00b6 2 \nabove (SOR \u00b6 3.a and 3.j). It also alleged a series of criminal arrests as follows: a March \n1992 arrest in a foreign country for misuse of privileges (SOR \u00b6 3.i); a July 1992 arrest \nfor theft of government property (SOR \u00b6 3.h); an August 1993 arrest for adultery (SOR \u00b6 \n3.g); a December 1993 arrest for adultery (SOR \u00b6 3.f); a June 2000 arrest for assault \n(SOR \u00b6 3.e); a July 2000 arrest for driving while license under restraint (SOR \u00b6 3.d); an \nApril 2001 arrest for his failure to appear (SOR \u00b6 3.c); and his August 2001 arrest for \ndamaging property, criminal mischief, and making a false police report (SOR \u00b6 3.b). \nApplicant admitted all the allegations, except for SOR \u00b6\u00b6 3.f and 3.h, during his \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nbackground interview, in his SOR answer, and during his testimony.

He knowingly ingested some edible marijuana lozenges \nwhile employed by this company. He consumed two over two days. Three weeks later, \nhe was assigned to drive a company vehicle and was involved in an accident. He was \nrequired to take a urinalysis test because of the accident. It came back with a positive \nresult for the presence of marijuana. His employer immediately terminated him from his \nposition based upon his use of marijuana. He was aware of the company\u2019s drug policy \nand knew he was not allowed to use any illegal drugs during his employment with this \ncontractor. (Tr. 21-22, 45; GE 2) \nIn March 2022, Applicant completed an SCA for his current employer. He gave \nfalse information on his SCA when he deliberately failed to disclose in Section 13A and \n13C that he was fired for cause in 2019 because of his use of marijuana as established \nby a positive urinalysis test. He also deliberately failed to disclose his 2019 marijuana use \nin Section 23 of his 2022 SCA. During his background investigation and at his hearing, \nApplicant admitted knowingly making these false statements because he was afraid that \nrevealing the truth would jeopardize his chances of receiving a security clearance. He \nadmitted his arrest for using and possessing marijuana in 2003 on a military installation. \nHe denied the marijuana was his, or that he used it on that occasion, and there is no \nrecord evidence contradicting his statement. He admitted using marijuana and testing \npositive for it in approximately 1995 or 1996 when he was in the Army. (Tr. 19, 46; GE 2) \nIn August 2001, he was angry with his ex-wife who was storing some furniture at \nhis residence. In his anger, he destroyed several pieces of furniture. He later called the \npolice and reported that someone broke into his house and destroyed the furniture. He \nwas confronted by the officers about submitting false information and admitted that he did \nso. He was charged with destruction of property and filing a false police report. He \nadmitted committing these offenses. (Tr. 30-31; GE 2, 4) \nApplicant admitted his arrest for failing to appear for a court appearance in 2001. \nHe admitted his arrest for driving while his license was under restraint in July 2000. He \nadmitted his arrest for assault in June 2000. He admitted his arrest for adultery in August \n1993. He admitted his arrest in March 1992 for misuse of privileges. There is no additional \nevidence available about these offenses. (SOR answer) \nApplicant denied an arrest for adultery and sodomy in December 1993, and an \narrest for larceny of government property in July 1992. There is no evidence in the record \nto contradict his denials. (Tr. 27, 35; GE 1-4; SOR answer) \nApplicant testified that he has not used marijuana since 2019. He has not been \narrested since 2003. He provided a written statement promising to abstain from using any \nillegal substances in the future.

The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), \nthe entire process is a careful weighing of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-\nperson concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation about potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nAnalysis \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the personal conduct security concern: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. \nUnder AG \u00b6 16, conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying include: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \naward benefits or status, determine national; and    \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information, \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with \nrules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual \nmay not properly safeguard classified or sensitive information. This \nincludes, but is not limited to, consideration of: \n(1) untrustworthy or unreliable behavior to include breach of \nclient confidentiality, release of proprietary information, \nunauthorized release of sensitive corporate or government \nprotected information; \n(2) any disruptive, violent, or other inappropriate behavior; \n(3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations; and \n(4) evidence of significant misuse of Government or other \nemployer's time or resources. \nApplicant admitted that he deliberately provided false information on his 2022 SCA. \nIn 2019, he was fired from his employment for testing positive for marijuana by his \nemployer. In 1995 or 1996, he also tested positive for marijuana when he was in the Army \nwhile holding a security clearance. AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(a) and 16(d) apply.

Lying on his \nSCA, and using marijuana when he knew it was against company policy and was illegal \nin the Army, cast doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. Applicant \nacknowledged his wrongdoing; however, he has a history of such behavior going back to \nhis filing of a false police report in 2001. AG \u00b6\u00b6 17(a), 17(c), and 17(d) do not apply. \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Abuse \nAG \u00b6 24 expresses the security concern pertaining to drug involvement: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" as \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in \nthis guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \n \nAG \u00b6 25 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. Those that are potentially applicable in this case include: \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(a) any substance misuse;  \n(b) testing positive for an illegal drug; and \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia. \nApplicant tested positive for marijuana in 2019, which led to his firing from his \ncontractor position. AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a) and 25(b) apply to SOR \u00b6 2.a. Although he admitted his \narrest for possession and use of marijuana in 2003, he denied the underlying allegations \nthat he used and possessed marijuana. Since there is no record evidence to support the \n2003 allegation. I find in favor of Appellant concerning SOR \u00b6 2.b. \nAG \u00b6 26 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns, two of which \npotentially apply in this case: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; \nand \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility. \nApplicant used marijuana while working for a government contractor. He was in a \nposition of trust at the time of the incident. His claimed abstinence beginning in 2019 is \nnot sufficient to overcome his marijuana use. Although he asserts that he will not use \nmarijuana now, he has a history of use that goes back over almost 30 years to his days \nin the Army when he held a security clearance. His claimed abstinence and promise not \nto use in the future are insufficient to convince me that recurrence is unlikely. His use of \nmarijuana while holding a security clearance and holding a position of trust cast doubt \nupon his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. AG \u00b6 26(a) does not \napply. AG \u00b6 26(b) has some application. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for criminal conduct is set out in AG \n\u00b6 30: \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability or \nwillingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations. \nAG \u00b6 31 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case. The following is potentially applicable: \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the person was formally charged, formally prosecuted or convicted. \nApplicant was charged with multiple offenses including arrests in 2003, two in \n2001, two in 2000, two in 1993, and two in 1992. He also admitted to using marijuana in \n2019. I find that the above disqualifying condition applies, except to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 3.f and 3.g, \nwhich were not established. \nI have also considered all the mitigating conditions for criminal conduct under AG \n\u00b6 32 and considered the following relevant: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited to \nthe passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \nHad Applicant not used marijuana as recently as 2019 or lied on his SCA in 2022, \nhis older criminal record might have been mitigated by the passage of time. However, it \nis clear from his recent actions that he is not rehabilitated and continues to engage in \ncriminal activity. His actions continue to cast doubt on his current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and good judgment. AG \u00b6\u00b6 32(a) and 32(d) do not fully apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances \nsurrounding this case. I considered Applicant\u2019s military service. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns under Guidelines E, H and J. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline E:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.d, 1.f: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.e: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline H: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.b: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 3, Guideline J: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 3.a, 3.f, 3.h: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 3.b-3.e, 3.g, 3.i-3.j: \nAgainst Applicant \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The President \nhas authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicant\u2019s eligibility for \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Clearance \ndecisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \nThus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that it is based, in whole or \nin part, on any express or implied determination about applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or \npatriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the \nPresident, Secretary of Defense, and Director of National Intelligence have established \nfor issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability.

Controlled substance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d as \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in \nthis guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nAG \u00b6 25 provides conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \u201c(a) any substance misuse (see above definition)\u201d; \u201c(b) testing \npositive for an illegal drug\u201d; and \u201c(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance. . . .\u201d The \nrecord establishes AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a), 25(b), and 25(c). Additional discussion is in the mitigation \nsection, infra. \nAG \u00b6 26 lists four conditions that could mitigate security concerns: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; and \n5 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility; \n \n(c) abuse of prescription drugs was after a severe or prolonged illness \nduring which these drugs were prescribed, and abuse has since ended; and \n(d) satisfactory completion of a prescribed drug treatment program, \nincluding, but not limited to, rehabilitation and aftercare requirements, \nwithout recurrence of abuse, and a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified \nmedical professional. \nIn ISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013), the DOHA Appeal \nBoard concisely explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for proving the applicability of \nmitigating conditions as follows: \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of \na security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government \npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the \napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The \nstandard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in \nEgan, supra. \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access \nto classified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nDirective, Enclosure 2, [App. A] \u00b6 2(b).   \nApplicant knowingly used marijuana in November 2020, and his marijuana use was \ndetected when his employer administered a urinalysis test. He possessed marijuana \nbefore he used it. I do not believe Applicant\u2019s claim in his OPM interview that his marijuana \nuse was unknowing or a case of innocent ingestion. \nSchedules I, II, III, IV, and V, as referred to in the Controlled Substances Act, are \ncontained in 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 812(c). Possession of controlled substances without a lawful \nprescription is a federal criminal offense. For marijuana, a lawful prescription is not \nauthorized under federal law. Marijuana is listed on Schedule I. See Drug Enforcement \nAdministration listing of controlled substances on Schedules I through IV at \nhttps://www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/schedules/orangebook/c cs alpha.pdf. \nThe Security Executive Agent (SecEA) promulgated clarifying guidance \nconcerning marijuana-related issues in security clearance adjudications as follows: \n[Federal] agencies are instructed that prior recreational marijuana use by \nan individual may be relevant to adjudications but not determinative. The \nSecEA has provided direction in [the adjudicative guidelines] to agencies \nthat requires them to use a \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d This requires \n6 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nadjudicators to carefully weigh a number of variables in an individual\u2019s life \nto determine whether that individual's behavior raises a security concern, if \nat all, and whether that concern has been mitigated such that the individual \nmay now receive a favorable adjudicative determination. Relevant \nmitigations include, but are not limited to, frequency of use and whether the \nindividual can demonstrate that future use is unlikely to recur, including by \nsigning an attestation or other such appropriate mitigation. Additionally, in \nlight of the long-standing federal law and policy prohibiting illegal drug use \nwhile occupying a sensitive position or holding a security .clearance, \nagencies are encouraged to advise prospective national security workforce \nemployees that they should refrain from any future marijuana use upon \ninitiation of the national security vetting process, which commences once \nthe individual signs the certification contained in the Standard Form 86 (SF-\n86), Questionnaire for National Security Positions. \nSecurity Executive Agent Clarifying Guidance Concerning Marijuana for Agencies \nConducting Adjudications of Persons Proposed for Eligibility for Access to Classified \nInformation or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (Dec. 21, 2021) at 2 (quoted in ISCR \nCase No. 20-02974 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Feb. 1, 2022)). \nApplicant said he used marijuana once in November 2020, and that marijuana use \nwas detected in a urinalysis test. He said he does not intend to use marijuana in the future. \nHowever, Applicant attempted to adulterate his urine sample during the collection of his \nurine sample for urinalysis testing to keep his employer from discovering his marijuana \nuse. He was not honest and candid on his SCA about his marijuana use. \nThe SOR does not allege that Applicant failed to provide accurate information \nduring his May 10, 2022 OPM PSI, when he confirmed information in his SCA that he was \nlaid off from his employment with S due to COVID. He also told the OPM investigator that \nhe was not involved with illegal drugs in the previous seven years. In ISCR Case No. 03-\n20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006), the Appeal Board listed five circumstances in which \nconduct not alleged in an SOR may be considered stating:  \n(a) to assess an applicant\u2019s credibility; (b) to evaluate an applicant\u2019s \nevidence of extenuation, mitigation, or changed circumstances; (c) to \nconsider whether an applicant has demonstrated successful rehabilitation; \n(d) to decide whether a particular provision of the Adjudicative Guidelines is \napplicable; or (e) to provide evidence for whole person analysis under \nDirective Section 6.3.  \nId.

Guideline H security \nconcerns are not mitigated. \nPersonal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 describes the security concern about personal conduct as follows: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. . . .  \nAG \u00b6 16 includes one disqualifying condition that could raise a security concern \nand may be disqualifying in this case: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \naward benefits or status, determine national security eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \nAG \u00b6 16(a) applies and will be addressed in the mitigating section, infra. \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns as follows: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was caused \nor significantly contributed to by advice of legal counsel or of a person with \nprofessional responsibilities for advising or instructing the individual \nspecifically concerning security processes.

His \nprovision of false information during his OPM PSI will not be considered for \ndisqualification purposes; however, it will be considered for the five purposes on page 7, \nsupra. \n9 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n     \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant knowingly and intentionally fabricated his SCA with intent to deceive. \nNone of the mitigating conditions fully apply. Personal conduct security concerns are not \nmitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), \u201c[t]he ultimate determination\u201d of whether to grant a security \nclearance \u201cmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines\u201d and the whole-person concept. My comments under Guidelines H and \nE are incorporated in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under those guidelines but some warrant additional comment. \nApplicant is a 45-year-old senior analyst who is seeking employment with a DOD \ncontractor. In 2014, he was awarded an associate degree, and in 2017, he was awarded \na bachelor\u2019s degree. He did not disclose any arrests, abuse of alcohol, or security \nviolations on his SCA, and there is no evidence to the contrary. \nThe evidence against grant of a security clearance is more persuasive at this time. \nIn November 2020, Applicant unsuccessfully attempted to adulterate his urine sample, \nwhich subsequently tested positive for the presence of the THC metabolite. He lied on his \nApril 7, 2022 SCA and during his initial OPM PSI about why he was terminated from \nemployment with company S and about using marijuana in November 2020. I find that he \ndeliberately provided false information on his SCA and during his initial OPM PSI. \nAn honest and candid self-report of security-relevant personal information is an \nimportant indication that, if granted security clearance eligibility, the individual would \ndisclose any threats to national security, even if the disclosure involves an issue that \nmight damage his or her own career or personal reputation. \nIt is well settled that once a concern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s security \nclearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption against granting a security clearance. \nSee Dorfmont, 913 F. 2d at 1401. \u201c[A] favorable clearance decision means that the record \ndiscloses no basis for doubt about an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \n10 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_________________________ \ninformation.\u201d ISCR Case No. 18-02085 at 7 (App. Bd.

He is 22 years old, \nunmarried, and he does not have any children. He graduated from high school in 2018, \nand he earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in May 2022. He has worked as an associate for his \nemployer, a DOD contractor, since June 2022.

(SOR \u00b6 1.a) He used it recreationally, and he estimated that he \nused it approximately 75 times. He obtained it from and used it with friends. (Items 1-5) \nApplicant also used nitrous oxide, with varying frequency from approximately \nFebruary 2020 to July 2021. (SOR \u00b6 1.b) He used the inhalant, also known as \n\u201cwhippets,\u201d recreationally approximately four to five times over the course of several \nmonths. He used it with his stepbrother, who purchased it. It made him feel semi-\neuphoric. (Items 1-5) \nApplicant stated in his SCA and indicated during his background interview that he \nmay use marijuana again if it becomes legal under federal law. He stated in his May \n2022 security clearance application (SCA), \u201cI do not find myself in a situation where I \nwould want to use this drug [nitrous oxide] in the future.\u201d He indicated during his \nbackground interview that he did not currently use illegal drugs or misuse prescription \ndrugs, but that he might use drugs again if they became legal. He indicated that he did \nnot socialize with individuals who use drugs illegally. (Items 4-5) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the \nGovernment must present evidence to establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and \nother evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by the applicant \nor proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion \nto obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. Section 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse  \nAG \u00b6 24 expresses the security concern pertaining to drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse as: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. \nAG \u00b6 25 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. I considered the following relevant: \u201c(a) any substance misuse . . . ,\u201d and \n\u201c(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, processing, \nmanufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of drug paraphernalia.\u201d \nApplicant used marijuana with varying frequency between 2017 and 2022. He \nalso used nitrous oxide with varying frequency between 2020 and 2021. He stated in his \nSCA and indicated during his background interview that he would likely use marijuana \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nand drugs again in the future if they became legal. AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a) and 25(c) are \nestablished. \nAG \u00b6 26 provides the following potentially relevant mitigating conditions: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were \nused; and \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all \ndrug involvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that \nany future involvement or misuse is grounds for revocation \nof national security eligibility. \nApplicant indicated during his background interview that he no longer associated \nwith the individuals with whom he previously used drugs illegally. AG \u00b6 26(b)(1) is \nestablished. However, he did not provide a signed statement of intent to abstain from all \ndrug involvement and substance misuse. He also kept open the possibility of using \ndrugs again in the future if they were legal. Further, Applicant last used nitrous oxide \nless than two years ago, and last used marijuana as recently as January 2022. His use \nis recent enough that I cannot find that it is unlikely to recur. I find that AG \u00b6\u00b6 26(a), \n26(b)(2), and 26(b)(3) are not established. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline H in this whole-person analysis. Overall, the record evidence leaves me with \nquestions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I \nconclude Applicant failed to mitigate the drug involvement security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance.
