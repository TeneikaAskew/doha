Nagel, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\nJanuary 25, 2010\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nLOKEY ANDERSON, Darlene D., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted his Questionnaire for Sensitive Positions (SF-86) on January\n6, 2009.  (Government Exhibit 1).  On July 22, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings\nand Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense\nDirective 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, (as amended), issued a Statement\nof Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant, which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make\nthe preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the Applicant and\nrecommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether clearance\nshould be denied or revoked.\nThe Applicant responded to the SOR on August 3, 2009, and he requested an\nadministrative decision without a hearing.  Department Counsel requested a hearing\nand the matter was converted from an Administrative decision to a hearing before a\nDOHA Administrative Judge.  This case was assigned to the undersigned on\nSeptember 11, 2009.  A notice of hearing was issued on September 15, 2009, and the\nhearing was scheduled for November 19, 2009.  At the hearing the Government\npresented six exhibits, referred to as Government Exhibits 1 through 6.  The Applicant\npresented six exhibits, referred to as Applicant\u2019s Exhibits A through F.  He also testified\n\n2\non his own behalf.  The record remained open until close of business on November 29,\n2009, to allow the Applicant the opportunity to submit additional documentation.  The\nApplicant submitted one Post-Hearing Exhibit which was admitted without objection, as\nApplicant\u2019s Post-Hearing Exhibit.  The official transcript (Tr.) was received on December\n1, 2009.  Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony,\neligibility for access to classified information is granted.\n FINDINGS OF FACT\nThe Applicant is 34 years old, unmarried, with two children.  He has a Bachelor\nDegree in Computer Science.  He was previously employed with a defense contractor\nas a Systems Engineer and a Storage Internet Architect, and if he obtains a security\nclearance he will be rehired.  He is seeking to obtain a security clearance in connection\nwith this employment.\nThe Government opposes the Applicant's request for a security clearance, on the\nbasis of allegations set forth in the Statement of Reasons (SOR).  The following findings\nof fact are entered as to each paragraph and guideline in the SOR:\nParagraph 1 (Guideline F - Financial Considerations)  The Government alleges that the\nApplicant is ineligible for clearance because he is financially overextended and at risk of\nhaving to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.      \nFrom 1993 to 2003, the Applicant served honorably in the United States Army.\nDuring those ten years, he held a security clearance and was honorably discharged in\n2003, after a stellar career.  Applicant then began doing contract work for various\ndefense contractors, and experienced periods of unemployment between contracts.\nThis caused some financial difficulties.  In July 2009, the Applicant was terminated from\nhis employment because he did not have a security clearance.  In the event that\nApplicant obtains a security clearance and is rehired, he states that it is his priority to\nresolve all of his debts, and he plans to do so within six months.  (Tr. p. 83).     \n       \nThe Applicant admits to eight of the debts set forth in the SOR (allegations 1(a),\n1(e), 1(f), 1(h), 1(i) 1(j), 1(k), and 1(n).  He denies six of the debts (allegations 1(b), 1(c),\n1(d), 1(g), 1(l) and 1(m).  Credit Reports of the Applicant dated May 29, 2008, February\n26, 2009, June 25, 2009, and November 14, 2009, reflect that the Applicant was\nindebted to each of the creditors set forth in the SOR, in an amount totaling\napproximately $25,000.  (Government Exhibits 3, 4, 5, and 6).  Applicant explained that\nhe was not aware of the delinquent debt listed in the SOR until after his interview with\nthe investigator.  At that time, he learned that his partner, who had been living with him\nand handling the household finances, had not been paying the bills, even though the\nApplicant had been bringing home the paycheck.  Applicant was so misled that, among\nother problems, he lost all of his belongings in a storage unit, including his personal and\nchildhood memories, because his partner did not made the payments, when she\nrepresented that she did.  Since then, the Applicant has made progress clearing up his\n\n3\ncredit report, paying off his bills, setting up payment plans, and terminating his\nrelationship with his partner.\nThe following delinquent debts are listed in the SOR;\n \n1(a).  A debt owed to a creditor in the amount of $255.00 has been paid in full.\n(Applicant\u2019s Exhibit B, Applicant\u2019s Post-Hearing Exhibit, and Tr. p. 32).  \n1(b).  A debt owed to a creditor in the amount of $566.00 remains outstanding.\nApplicant is not sure whether the debt is his, as the creditor has been unable to confirm\nthe debt.  If it is determined to be his debt, he will pay it.  (Tr. p. 44).  \n1(c).  A debt owed to a bank for a delinquent credit card account in the amount of\n$19,750.00 has been resolved.  Applicant testified that the debt is not his.  He also\nprovided documentation from the creditor indicating that he is not an authorized user on\nthe account and is therefore not responsible for the debt.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit A, and\nApplicant\u2019s Post-Hearing Exhibit).  \n1(d).  A debt owed to a creditor in the amount of $1,408.00 remains outstanding.\nApplicant believes the debt involves identity theft or the misuse of his personal\ninformation by other parties.  Applicant has filed for identity theft protection.  He has no\nknowledge of the debt and has tried to contact the creditor but they no longer exist.  It\ncould possibly be his former partners debt.  If it turns out that he owes the debt, he will\npay it.  (Tr. p. 40).  \n1(e).  A debt owed to a creditor in the amount of $355.00 remains outstanding.\nApplicant had set up a payment plan of $50.00 per month to satisfy the debt but when\nhe lost his job he was unable to continue with the payments.  (Tr. p. 41).  He will resume\nthe payments when he is rehired.  \n1(f).  A debt owed to a creditor in the amount of $5,340.00 remains outstanding.\nApplicant explained that he co-signed for a vehicle for his mother.  She was supposed\nto make the payments but did not.  Applicant is presently reestablishing a payment plan\nwith the creditor and plans to resolve the debt in full.  (Tr. p. 43-44).  \n1(g).  A debt owed to a creditor in the amount of $2,635.00 is erroneous and has been\nremoved from the Applicant\u2019s credit report.  (Applicant\u2019s Post-Hearing Exhibit,\nApplicant\u2019s Exhibit C, and Tr. p. 46).  \n1(h). and 1(i).  Debts owed to two different creditors in the amount of $1,073.00 and\n$6,339.00 have been combined and Applicant has set up a payment plan of $100.00\nper month.  (Applicant\u2019s Post-Hearing Exhibit).  \n1(j).  A debt to a creditor in the amount of $135.00 has been paid.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit\nC, and Tr. p. 52).  \n\n4\n1(k).  A debt to a creditor in the amount of $513.00 remains outstanding.  Applicant set\nup a payment plan of $50.00 per month and will resume the agreement when he is\nemployed.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit E, and Tr. p. 53).  \n1(l).  A debt to a creditor in the amount of $6,528.00, is actually $528.00.  The account\nwas disputed and has since been deleted from all three credit reporting agencies.\n(Applicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR).    \n1(m).  A debt owed to a creditor in the amount of $512.00 has been resolved.  The\naccount was disputed and has been removed from the Applicant\u2019s credit report.\n(Applicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR).  \n1(n).  A debt originally owed to the IRS in the amount of $10,989.00 has been adjusted\nand Applicant now owes $688.00.  Applicant provided a copy of a release of levy dated\nNovember 18, 2008.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit F).  Applicant plans to contact the IRS and set\nup a payment plan to resolve the debt when he becomes employed.              \nPOLICIES\nEnclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudication policies divided into\n\"Disqualifying Factors\" and \"Mitigating Factors.\"  The following Disqualifying Factors\nand Mitigating Factors are found to be applicable in this case:\nGuideline F (Financial Considerations)\n18.  The Concern.  Failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to\nabide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s\nreliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information.  An individual who\nis financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate\nfunds. \nConditions that could raise a security concern:\n19.(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; \n19.(c) a history of not meeting financial obligation; \nConditions that could mitigate security concerns:\n20.(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond\nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected\nmedical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual acted\nresponsibly under the circumstances;\n\n5\n20.(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or\nthere are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control;\n20.(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or\notherwise resolve debts.\nIn addition, as set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive at pages 18-19,  in\nevaluating the relevance of an individual\u2019s conduct, the Administrative Judge should\nconsider the following general factors:\na.  The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding\ncircumstances;\n     b.  The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation;\nc.  The frequency and recency of the conduct;\nd.  The individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct;\ne.  The extent to which participation is voluntary;\nf.  The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavior\nchanges;\ng.  The motivation for the conduct; \nh. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress; and\n \ni.  The likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nThe eligibility criteria established in the DoD Directive identify personal\ncharacteristics and conduct which are reasonably related to the ultimate question,\nposed in Section 2 of Executive Order 10865, of whether it is \u201cclearly consistent with the\nnational interest\u201d to grant an Applicant\u2019s request for access to classified information.\nThe DoD Directive states, \u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a\nsufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the person is\nan acceptable security risk.  Eligibility for access to classified information is predicted\nupon the individual meeting these personnel security guidelines.  The adjudicative\nprocess is the careful weighing of a number of variables known as the whole person\nconcept.  Available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable\nand unfavorable should be considered in reaching a determination.\u201d The Administrative\nJudge can draw only those inferences or conclusions that have reasonable and logical\nbasis in the evidence of record.  The Judge cannot draw inferences or conclusions\nbased on evidence which is speculative or conjectural in nature.  Finally, as emphasized\n\n6\nby President Eisenhower in Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under this order\n. . . shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a\ndetermination as to the loyalty of the Applicant concerned.\u201d\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn the defense industry, the security of classified industrial secrets is entrusted to\ncivilian workers who must be counted upon to safeguard such sensitive information\ntwenty-four hours per day, seven days per week.  The Government is therefore\nappropriately concerned when available information indicates that an Applicant for\nclearance may be involved in instances of financial irresponsibility which demonstrates\npoor judgment or unreliability.\nIt is the Government\u2019s responsibility to present substantial evidence to support\nthe finding of a nexus, or rational connection, between the Applicant\u2019s conduct and the\nholding of a security clearance.  If such a case has been established, the burden then\nshifts to the Applicant to go forward with evidence in rebuttal, explanation or mitigation\nwhich is sufficient to overcome or outweigh the Government\u2019s case.  The Applicant\nbears the ultimate burden of persuasion in proving that it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant him or her a security clearance.\nIn this case the Government has met its initial burden of proving that the\nApplicant has been financially irresponsible (Guideline F).  This evidence indicates poor\njudgment, unreliability and untrustworthiness on the part of the Applicant.  Because of\nthe scope and nature of the Applicant's conduct, I conclude there is a nexus or\nconnection with his security clearance eligibility.\nThe evidence shows that circumstances largely beyond the Applicant\u2019s control,\nnamely, his ex-partner who misled him into believing the bills were being paid when they\nwere not, coupled with various periods of unemployment, caused his financial\ndifficulties.  Although the Applicant is still unemployed, he has done as much as is\nhumanly possible to inquire into and resolve his financial problems.  First, the Applicant\nis no longer with his deceptive partner, and has learned a harsh lesson from putting\nsomeone other than himself responsible for his debts.  Second, he has contacted his\ncreditors and informed them of his situation.  Third, he has either paid off the delinquent\ndebt or set up a payment plan that he plans to follow once he gains employment.   \nUnder the particular circumstance of this case, the Applicant has made a good\nfaith effort to resolve his past due indebtedness.  He has contacted each of his creditors\nand has either paid off the debt or is setting up a payment plan to do so.  He does not\nplan on incurring any new debt.  He understands the importance of paying his bills on\ntime and living within his means.  He also understands that he must follow his\ncommitment to continue to pay off his delinquent debt.  There is evidence of financial\nrehabilitation.  The Applicant has demonstrated that he can properly handle his financial\naffairs and that he is fiscally responsible.  Considering all of the evidence, the Applicant\n\n7\nhas introduced persuasive evidence in rebuttal, explanation or mitigation that is\nsufficient to overcome the Government's case. \nUnder Guideline F (Financial Considerations), Disqualifying Conditions 19.(a)\ninability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and 19.(c) a history of not meeting financial\nobligation apply.  However, Mitigating Conditions 20.(b) the conditions that resulted in\nthe financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of\nemployment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce\nor separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances, 20.(c) the\nperson has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear\nindications that the problem is being resolved or is under control and, 20.(d) the\nindividual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve\ndebts also apply.  Accordingly, I find for the Applicant under Guideline F (Financial\nConsiderations).    \nI have also considered the \u201cwhole person concept\u201d in evaluating the Applicant\u2019s\neligibility for access to classified information.  Under the particular facts of this case, the\ntotality of the conduct set forth above, when viewed under all of the guidelines as a\nwhole, support a whole person assessment of good judgement, trustworthiness,\nreliability, candor, and a  willingness to comply with rules and regulations, and/or other\ncharacteristics indicating that the person may properly safeguard classified information.\n  \nI have considered all of the evidence presented, including the Applicant\u2019s\nfavorable military history.  They mitigate the negative effects of his financial\nindebtedness and the effects that it can have on his ability to safeguard classified\ninformation.  On balance, it is concluded that the Applicant has overcome the\nGovernment's case opposing his request for a security clearance.  Accordingly, the\nevidence supports a finding for the Applicant as to the factual and conclusionary\nallegations expressed in Paragraph 1 of the SOR.   \n     \nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal findings For or Against the Applicant on the allegations in the SOR, as\nrequired by Paragraph 25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive are:\nParagraph 1: \nFor the Applicant.\n    \n    Subpara.  1.a.:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.b.:\nFor the Applicant.\n \n \n    Subpara.  1.c.:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.d.:\nFor the Applicant.\n \n    Subpara.  1.e.:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.f.:\nFor the Applicant.\n \n \n    Subpara.  1.g.:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.h.:\nFor the Applicant\n    \n    Subpara.  1.i.:\nFor the Applicant.\n\n8\n    Subpara.  1.j.:\nFor the Applicant.\n \n \n    Subpara.  1.k.:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.l.:\nFor the Applicant.\n \n    Subpara.  1.m.:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.n.:\nFor the Applicant.\n \n   \nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the\nApplicant.\n  Darlene Lokey Anderson\nAdministrative Judge\n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact After a thorough review of the pleadings, transcript, and exhibits, I make the following essential findings of fact. Applicant is a 42-year-old field service representative mechanic working on military vehicles for a defense contractor since September 2008. Prior to working for the defense contractor, Applicant was a self-employed truck driver and an automobile mechanic. He is married with three children, two still at home. Applicant is presently receiving workman's compensation of $4,800 monthly. His wife is also employed and contributes about $1,600 monthly to the family income, for a total monthly income of approximately $6,400. Their monthly expenses are about $5,700, leaving about $700 to $800 in monthly discretionary funds (Tr. 33-34, 43-44; Gov. Ex. 1, e-QIP, dated October 2, 2008). Credit reports and Applicant's admission show a charged off debt for a truck repossession of $14,402 (SOR 1.a). His personal financial statement provided to security investigators on March 16, 2009, showed a monthly negative remainder of 3 funds after expenses of $202 (SOR 1.b; Gov. 4, Credit report, dated March 3, 2009; Gov. Ex. 5, Credit report, dated October 15, 2008). In early 2008, Applicant believed he could enter the business of transporting cars to and from car auctions for local automobile dealers.

Blank, Esquire, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro Se \n \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \nCREAN, Thomas M., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations Processing \n(e-QIP) on October 2, 2008, as part of his employment with a defense contractor. On \nApril 24, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement \nof Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns for financial considerations \nunder Guideline F, and personal conduct under Guideline E. The action was taken \nunder Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \n(February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the \nPresident on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for \nSORs issued after September 1, 2006. Since Applicant was serving overseas when the \nSOR was issued, he did not acknowledge receipt of the SOR until June 2, 2009. \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on June 3, 2009. He denied all allegations \nunder both Guideline E and Guideline F. Applicant did not request a hearing. On July 1, \n2009, Department Counsel requested a hearing (Hearing Exhibit 1). The case was \nassigned to me on July 24, 2009. DOHA issued a Notice of Hearing on August 13, \n \n1 \n \n \nNovember 17, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n \n2009, for a hearing on September 3, 2009. Applicant signed for the Notice of Hearing on \nAugust 24, 2009. I convened the hearing as scheduled. Department Counsel offered \nfive exhibits, marked Government Exhibits (Gov. Ex.) 1 through 5, which were received \nwithout objection. Applicant testified on his behalf. The record was held open for \nApplicant to submit documents in support of his position. Applicant timely submitted \nthree documents, marked App. Ex. A through C. Department Counsel had no objection \nto admission of the documents (Gov. Ex. 6). The documents were admitted into the \nrecord. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on September 10, 2009. \nBased on a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for \naccess to classified information is denied. \n \nProcedural Issues \n \n \nApplicant signed for the Notice of Hearing on August 24, 2009. Applicant is \nentitled to 15 days notice of hearing (Directive E3.1.8). Applicant discussed with \nDepartment Counsel the hearing date of September 3, 2009, prior to the mailing of the \nNotice of Hearing. Accordingly, actual notice was given more than 15 days prior to the \nhearing. However, Applicant signed for the Notice of Hearing only 11 days prior to the \nhearing. He waived the 15 days notice requirement (Tr. 6). \n \n \nDepartment Counsel moved to amend the SOR at hearing to add an additional \nallegation under Guideline E for falsification of his e-QIP by failing to note a truck \nrepossession in the last seven years. The motion was denied since Department \nCounsel had adequate time to amend the SOR before the hearing and he had not \nnotified Applicant prior to the hearing of the intended amendment to the SOR (Tr. 11-\n12). \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nAfter a thorough review of the pleadings, transcript, and exhibits, I make the \nfollowing essential findings of fact.   \n \nApplicant is a 42-year-old field service representative mechanic working on \nmilitary vehicles for a defense contractor since September 2008. Prior to working for the \ndefense contractor, Applicant was a self-employed truck driver and an automobile \nmechanic. He is married with three children, two still at home. Applicant is presently \nreceiving workman's compensation of $4,800 monthly. His wife is also employed and \ncontributes about $1,600 monthly to the family income, for a total monthly income of \napproximately $6,400. Their monthly expenses are about $5,700, leaving about $700 to \n$800 in monthly discretionary funds (Tr. 33-34, 43-44; Gov. Ex. 1, e-QIP, dated October \n2, 2008). \n \nCredit reports and Applicant's admission show a charged off debt for a truck \nrepossession of $14,402 (SOR 1.a). His personal financial statement provided to \nsecurity investigators on March 16, 2009, showed a monthly negative remainder of \n\n \n3 \n \n \nfunds after expenses of $202 (SOR 1.b; Gov. 4, Credit report, dated March 3, 2009; \nGov. Ex. 5, Credit report, dated October 15, 2008).  \n \nIn early 2008, Applicant believed he could enter the business of transporting cars \nto and from car auctions for local automobile dealers. He had heard from others that the \nbusiness would be profitable. Applicant had worked for many years as an automobile \nmechanic and knew a number of people in the automobile industry in the area. He \nbelieved he would have sufficient business to make a profit. Applicant did not present \nany information to show he conducted a meaningful evaluation of the profitability of this \ntype of business. Applicant purchased a truck for $40,000 in February 2008. Within a \nshort time, the price of fuel increased and Applicant realized he could not make a profit \nin the business. Applicant's last payment on the truck was in April 2008. In May 2008, \nApplicant voluntarily returned the truck to the dealer prior to the due date for his monthly \npayment. Applicant still owed over $35,000 for the truck. The truck was sold at auction \nfor $21,000 leaving Applicant still owing the creditor $14,402 (Tr. 26-27; 44-47). \n \nApplicant did not immediately receive information from the creditor about the \nauction of the truck or the amount he may still owe on the truck loan. He started working \nfor the defense contractor in September 2008, and completed his security clearance \napplication in October 2008. He was sent to Iraq by his employer to work on military \nvehicles in December 2008. Shortly after arrival in Iraq, Applicant learned from his wife \nthat the creditor had advised them of the auction price received for the truck and the \ndebt still owed of $14,402. Applicant knew he would have a debt from the auction of the \ntruck. However, since the truck had less than 2,000 miles on it, he thought the truck sale \nwould be for at least $30,000, leaving him with a debt of about $5,000 (Tr. 42-50).  \n \nApplicant was injured on the job in Iraq in March 2009 and returned home to the \nUnited States. He is receiving workman's compensation for that injury. After returning \nhome, Applicant contacted the creditor on the truck loan in May 2009 to seek an \nagreement for payment of the debt. The creditor offered a lump sum payment option of \n$9,000 that Applicant was unable to pay. He offered to pay $100 per month until the \ndebt was satisfied. The creditor rejected the offer. Applicant sent a $100 payment to the \ncreditor after the hearing in September 2009 (Tr. 32-34, 38-39, 56-57; App. Ex. A, \nApplicant's letter, undated; App. Ex. B, Money order receipt, dated September 14, 2009; \nApp. Ex. C, Settlement notice, dated September 8, 2009). \n \nApplicant completed a personal financial statement in response to interrogatories \non March 16, 2009. He had just returned from Iraq after being injured. His pay has been \nreduced from what he earned in Iraq. He listed his net monthly salary as $3,244 with \nmonthly expenses of $3,446, leaving a negative monthly remainder of $202. He did not \nlist any income for his wife. Shortly after completing the financial statement, Applicant \nstarted drawing unemployment and his income increased. His wife is also employed \nand contributes to the family income. He now has a net remainder of a positive $700 to \n$800 (Tr. 32-33, 43-44; Gov. Ex. 2, Answers to Interrogatories, dated March 16, 2009). \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \nIn 1989, Applicant was convicted and sentenced for obtaining property by false \npretense (SOR 2.a; Gov. Ex. 3, Federal Bureau of Investigation Criminal Justice \nReport). Applicant responded \"NO' to question 28(a) on his October 2008 security \nclearance application asking if he had debts more than 180 days past due in the last \nseven years, and question 28(b) asking if he had any present debts more than 90 days \npast due (SOR 2.b; Gov. Ex. 4, Credit report, dated March 3, 2009; Gov. Ex. 5, Credit \nreport, dated October 15, 2008).  \n \nApplicant worked for an automobile dealer and repair business in 1989. Part of \nhis job was to purchase parts needed to repair cars at his employer's business using an \nopen account with the parts distributors. Applicant admitted using the open account to \npurchase automobile parts not intended for his use by his employer. He was sentenced \nto a year confinement, which was suspended, and a $2,000 fine. He paid the fine and \ncompleted the period of suspension. He has no other criminal charges or actions (Tr. \n55-56). \n \nApplicant did not list the truck repossession on the e-QIP because he believed \nthat his truck had not been repossessed since he turned it in voluntarily. After he \nreturned the truck to the dealer/creditor, Applicant knew he may owe some money on \nthe truck if the sale of the truck did not cover the amount owed. At the time he \ncompleted the e-QIP in October 2008, he did not know if he owed money on the truck or \nhow much. He did not know he had a debt more than 180 days past due or presently \nmore than 90 days past due. Since the truck was repossessed in May 2008 and he \ncompleted the security clearance application in October 2008, 180 days had not passed \nso he could not have been delinquent on a loan for more than 180 days. \n \nPolicies \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are still requiredl in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \n\n \n5 \n \n \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n \nAnalysis \n \nFinancial Considerations \n \n \nUnder financial considerations, failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, \nsatisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of \njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified \ninformation. An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage \nin illegal acts to generate funds (AG \u00b6 18). Similarly, an individual who is financially \nirresponsible may also be irresponsible, unconcerned, or careless in their obligations to \nprotect classified information. Behaving responsibly or irresponsibly in one aspect of life \nprovides an indication of how a person may behave in other aspects of life.  \n \n \nA person\u2019s relationship with his creditors is a private matter until evidence is \nuncovered demonstrating an inability or unwillingness to repay debts under agreed \nterms. Absent strong evidence of extenuating or mitigating circumstances, an applicant \nwith a history of serious or recurring financial difficulties is in a situation of risk \ninconsistent with the holding of a security clearance. An applicant is not required to be \ndebt free, but is required to manage his finances in such a way as to meet his financial \nobligations. Applicant's delinquent debt from a loan for a truck as listed on credit reports \nand admitted by Applicant is a security concern raising Financial Considerations \nDisqualifying Conditions (FC DC) AG \u00b6 19(a) (inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts), \nand FC DC AG \u00b6 19(c) (a history of not meeting financial obligations). Applicant \ncompleted a personal financial statement shortly after returning early from Iraq because \nof an injury. His pay was reduced, and he had not had time to adjust his expenses to his \n\n \n6 \n \n \nnew lower income. He also did not include his wife's salary on the financial history. \nApplicant demonstrated that his pay has increased since he is now receiving workman's \ncompensation and his wife contributes to the family income. He has a net positive \nremainder each month. His present personal finances do not have a negative monthly \nremainder. Applicant's present income and expense ratio are not now a security \nconcern.  \n \n \nI considered the Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions (FC MC) raised \nby Applicant's testimony. FC MC AG \u00b6 20(a) (the behavior happened so long ago, was \nso infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does \nnot cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment) \ndoes not apply. Applicant has an outstanding debt of $14,402 on a truck loan. The debt \narose in May 2008 and has not been paid. It arose because Applicant's business \nventure did not provide the income he anticipated and his expenses were more than \nanticipated.   \n \n \nI considered FC MC \u00b6 20(b) (the conditions that resulted in the financial problems \nwere largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce, or separation), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances). Applicant purchased a truck to \nenter a new line of business to haul cars to and from auctions. Within two months, he \nrealized that the business would not be profitable. Part of the reason was the increase \nin fuel prices. Applicant entered the new business without carefully analysis of what it \nwould take to make the business profitable. He relied on the word from others that it \nwas a profitable business venture. The fact that he had to return the truck within two \nmonths shows he did not carefully evaluate the business prospects. He entered the \nbusiness without a solid business plan. He did not act responsibly under the \ncircumstances.   \n \n \nI considered FC MC \u00b6 20(d) (the individual has initiated a good-faith effort to \nrepay the overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts). For FC MC \u00b6 20(d) to apply, \nthere must be an \u201cability\u201d to repay the debts, the \u201cdesire\u201d to repay, and \u201cevidence\u201d of a \ngood-faith effort to repay. A systematic, concrete method of handling debts is needed. \nGood-faith means acting in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, honesty, and \nadherence to duty or obligation. Evidence of past irresponsibility is not mitigated by \npayment of debt only under pressure of qualifying for a security clearance. Applicant \nmade one payment to the creditor in September 2009 after the hearing. He does not \nhave a verifiable plan to pay his delinquent debt. One payment after the hearing is not \nevidence of a good-faith effort to resolve the debt. Applicant has not mitigated security \nconcerns based on his finances. \n \nPersonal Conduct \n \n \nA security concern is raised because conduct involving questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations \ncan raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \n\n \n7 \n \n \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful and candid \nanswers during the security clearance process or any other failure to cooperate with the \nsecurity clearance process (AG \u00b6 15). Personal conduct is always a security concern \nbecause it asks the central question does the person\u2019s past conduct justify confidence \nthe person can be entrusted to properly safeguard classified information. The security \nclearance system depends on the individual providing correct and accurate information. \nIf a person conceals or provides false information, the security clearance process \ncannot function properly to ensure that granting access to classified information is in the \nbest interest of the United States Government. Appellant\u2019s incorrect answers to \nquestions on his security clearance application concerning finances and truck \nrepossession raise a security concern under Personal Conduct Disqualifying Condition \n(PC DC) AG \u00b6 16(a) (the deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant \nand material facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, to determine security eligibility or trustworthiness). \n \n \nAppellant denied intentional falsification. While there is a security concern for an \nomission, concealment, or falsification of a material fact in any written document or oral \nstatement to the government when applying for a security clearance, every omission, \nconcealment, or inaccurate statement is not a falsification. A falsification must be \ndeliberate and material. It is deliberate if it is done knowingly and willfully with intent to \ndeceive. Appellant did not believe that when he voluntarily returned the truck to the \ndealer/creditor that it was considered repossession. At the time that he completed the \nsecurity clearance application, he did not know that the truck had not sold for enough to \ncover the remainder on the loan. At best, he thought he may owe a few thousand \ndollars. The creditor may have noted for the credit reporting agencies that a debt was \nowed as early as May 2008, but they did not notify Applicant until December 2008. He \ndid not receive information from the creditor of the amount owed until after he \ncompleted the security clearance applicant. Appellant honestly and reasonably believed \nthe truck was not repossessed, and he did not have other debts more than 180 days or \n90 days past due. His answers to the questions were not deliberately false because of \nhis honest and reasonable belief and his lack of information on the debt. Accordingly, \nhis wrong answers were not a deliberate intent to deceive. \n \n \nApplicant's conviction in 1989 for Obtaining Property by False Pretense raises \nPC DC AG 16(c) (credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue area that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single guideline, but which, \nwhen considered as  a whole, supports a whole-person assessment of questionable \njudgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with \nrules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the person may not \nproperly safeguard protected information). \n \n \nAppellant has raised by his testimony Personal Conduct Mitigating Condition (PC \nMC) AG \u00b6 17(c) (the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances, that it is unlikely to \nrecur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment). The offense happened in 1989, over 20 years ago. Applicant completed the \n\n \n8 \n \n \nsentence of a suspended jail term and paid a fine. He has not been involved in any \nother criminal or adverse conduct since that time. The passage of time and lack of other \nadverse conduct shows that the actions are not likely to recur. These factors also show \nthat his conduct in 1989 does not now impact on his reliability, trustworthiness or good \njudgment. Applicant has mitigated security concerns for personal conduct. \n \nWhole Person Analysis  \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s security eligibility by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all \nthe circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative \nprocess factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant a security clearance \nmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nguidelines and the whole person concept.  \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I considered Applicant's willingness \nto serve the country in Iraq, and the fact he was injured while working there.  \n \nApplicant must establish a \"meaningful track record\" of debt payment, including \nevidence of actual debt reduction through payment of debts. He is not required, as a \nmatter of law, to establish that he paid the debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is \nthat he has a plan to resolve his financial problems and takes significant action to \nimplement that plan. The entirety of his financial situation and his actions can \nreasonably be considered in evaluating the extent to which his plan to reduce his \noutstanding indebtedness is credible and realistic. Available, reliable information about \nthe person's behavior, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be \nconsidered in reaching a determination.   \n \nApplicant has not established a meaningful track record of debt payment. \nApplicant knew of the debt in January 2009 when he was in Iraq making a good salary. \nHe left Iraq in March 2009 after being injured. He suffered a loss of pay for a short time \nuntil he started receiving workman's compensation. He contacted the creditor in May \n2009, but he made only one payments of $100 after the hearing in September 2009. His \nlack of action on the debt until recently is not a good-faith effort to resolve the debt. \n\n \n9 \n \n \nApplicant has not demonstrated a credible and realistic plan to manage his debt under \nthe circumstances. The inability or unwillingness to establish a concrete plan to resolve \nhis financial issues indicates he will not be concerned, responsible, and careful in \nregard to classified information. Overall, the record evidence leaves me with questions \nand doubts as to Applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. He has not \nestablished he is suitable for a security clearance. I conclude Appellant has not \nmitigated the security concerns arising from his financial situation. He has mitigated \nsecurity concerns for personal conduct. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.b:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusions \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

She earned a bachelors degree in 2000. She is single and has no children. She has been employed as a Windows system administrator since April 2008.

Accordingly, her request for a security clearance is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \n \nOn April 4, 2008, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for \nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP) to request a security clearance required as part of her \nemployment with a defense contractor. (Item 4) After reviewing the results of the \nensuing background investigation, adjudicators for the Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals (DOHA) were unable to make a preliminary affirmative finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s request. 1  \n \n1 \n \n \n                                                          \n \n \n1 Required by Executive Order 10865, as amended, and by DoD Directive 5220.6 (Directive), as \namended. \nJuly 26, 2010\n\n \n2 \n \n \n                                                          \nOn December 23, 2009, DOHA issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons \n(SOR) (Item 1) that specified the basis for its decision: security concerns addressed in \nthe Directive under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of the Adjudicative \nGuidelines (AG). Applicant signed her Answer to the SOR on February 9, 2010, and \nrequested a decision without a hearing. In her Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted \neach of the 12 allegations under Guideline F. On March 22, 2010, DOHA Department \nCounsel submitted a file of relevant materials (FORM)2 in support of the government\u2019s \npreliminary decision. Applicant was given 30 days from the date she received the \nFORM to file a response, but did not respond. The case was assigned to me on July 7, \n2010, for an administrative decision based on the record. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions in response to the SOR are incorporated herein as fact. \nAfter a thorough review of the pleadings, Applicant\u2019s response to the SOR, and the \nFORM, I make the following additional findings of fact. \n \n \nApplicant is 33 years old. She earned a bachelors degree in 2000. She is single \nand has no children. She has been employed as a Windows system administrator since \nApril 2008. (Items 4, 5)  \n \n \nDuring her subject interview in June 2008, Applicant stated that her financial \nproblems began in late 2001 when she lived with her boyfriend. She was employed but \nhe was not. Without Applicant's knowledge, he used her credit cards and amassed large \nbalances on them. He died in 2002, and Applicant was unable to pay the bills that he \nhad created. Applicant was unemployed for approximately nine months at about the \nsame time, between 2002 and 2003. (Item 5) \n \n \nApplicant retained a loan consolidation company and consolidated several \nstudent loans. She pays $135 per month on student loans. The SOR lists student loans \namounting to approximately $22,000. It is unclear from the record whether these are \nadditional student loans, or the ones on which Applicant is making monthly payments. \nDuring her interview, Applicant stated that she had no knowledge of nine of the \ndelinquent debts listed in her credit report. There is no record evidence that she filed \ndisputes with the credit reporting agencies in regard to these debts. Applicant stated at \nher security interview that she wants to resolve her debts. (Item 5) \n \n \nApplicant's annual gross salary is $66,349. The personal financial statement \n(PFS) that she completed in June 2009 shows a monthly net income of $3,473. After \npaying expenses of $3,020, her monthly net remainder is $453. She did not list \npayments on any debts in her PFS. Applicant disclosed her debts on her security \nclearance application. (Items 4, 5) \n \n \n2 See Directive, Enclosure 3, Section E3.1.7. The FORM included 7 documents (Items 1 - 7) proffered in \nsupport of the government\u2019s case. \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \n                                                          \n \nThe 12 SOR debts total $93,388. Applicant's oldest delinquency dates from \n2001. In June 2009, she did not have sufficient funds to pay her debts, and was living \n\u201cpaycheck to paycheck.\u201d Other than her monthly payment on some student loans, \nApplicant has made no arrangements to pay any of the listed debts. (Items 5, 6, 7) \n \nPolicies \n \nEach security clearance decision must be a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndetermination based on examination of all available relevant and material information, \nand consideration of the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in the AG.3 Decisions \nmust also reflect consideration of the factors listed in \u00b6 2(a) of the Guidelines, commonly \nreferred to as the \u201cwhole-person\u201d concept.  The presence or absence of a disqualifying \nor mitigating condition is not determinative of a conclusion for or against an applicant. \nHowever, specific applicable guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be \nmeasured against them as they represent policy guidance governing the grant or denial \nof access to classified information. In this case, the pleadings and the information \npresented by the parties require consideration of the security concerns and adjudicative \nfactors addressed under Guideline F (financial considerations). \n \nA security clearance decision is intended only to resolve whether it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest4 for an applicant to either receive or continue to \nhave access to classified information. The Government bears the initial burden of \nproducing admissible information on which it based the preliminary decision to deny or \nrevoke a security clearance for an applicant. Additionally, the Government must be able \nto prove controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If the Government meets its burden, it \nthen falls to applicant to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the Government\u2019s case.  \n \nBecause no one has a \u201cright\u201d to a security clearance, an applicant bears a heavy \nburden of persuasion.5 A person who has access to classified information enters into a \nfiduciary relationship with the Government based on trust and confidence. Therefore, \nthe Government has a compelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the \nrequisite judgment, reliability and trustworthiness of one who will protect the national \ninterests as his or his own. The \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard \ncompels resolution of any reasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in \nfavor of the Government.6 \n \n \n \n \n \n3 Directive. 6.3. \n \n4 See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988). \n \n5 See Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, 531. \n \n6 See Egan; Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 2(b). \n\n \n4 \n \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nAG \u00b618 expresses the security concern pertaining to financial considerations: \n \nFailure or inability to live within one's means, satisfy debts, \nand meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, \nlack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and \nregulations, all of which can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. An individual who is financially over-\nextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to \ngenerate funds. Compulsive gambling is a concern as it may \nlead to financial crimes including espionage. Affluence that \ncannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern. It may indicate proceeds from financially \nprofitable criminal acts. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s history of failing to meet her financial obligations began in 2001. Her \nnine-year history of failing to pay numerous debts supports application of disqualifying \nconditions AG \u00b619(a) (inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts) and AG \u00b619(c) (a \nhistory of not meeting financial obligations). \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 20, I considered the six conditions that can potentially mitigate \nsecurity concerns, and conclude that the following five are relevant:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control;  \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; and  \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \n\n \n5 \n \n \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s failure to resolve her debts did not occur in the distant past, because \nthe debts are still delinquent. Although she stated in 2008 that she wished to resolve her \ndebts, she has made no effort to do so. Her failure to make any effort to deal with her \nlegitimate obligations casts doubt on her reliability and trustworthiness. AG \u00b6 20(a) \ncannot be applied. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b) is relevant because Applicant debts stemmed, in part, from the \nactions of her boyfriend in using her credit cards without her authorization, a \ncircumstance that she could not predict or control. In addition, Applicant was \nunemployed for approximately nine months at about the same time. Although \nunemployment can be mitigating, I cannot determine whether it is mitigating in \nApplicant's case, because I cannot deduce from the written record if this event was \nwithin Applicant's control. To claim mitigation under AG \u00b6 20(b), an applicant must also \nact responsibly under the circumstances. Applicant presented no evidence that she took \nsteps to stop her boyfriend from using her cards, or disputed any of the unauthorized \ncharges with the credit reporting agencies. Applicant failed to act responsibly, and only \npartial mitigation is available under AG \u00b6 20(b).  \n \n \nApplicant receives some mitigation under AG \u00b6 20(c) because she has \nconsolidated some student loans, However, she has not set up a payment plan for any \nother debts, nor brought her substantial debt load under control, despite having more \nthan $400 in discretionary funds each month. For the same reasons, mitigation is \nunavailable under AG \u00b6 20(d), which requires a good-faith effort to resolve debts. \nFinally, Applicant claims that numerous credit card debts were incurred through the \nactions of her boyfriend, implying that she believes she is not liable for them. However, \nshe provided no evidence that she contacted the credit reporting agencies to dispute \nthese credit card debts, nor the debts that she did not recognize during her security \ninterview. AG \u00b6 20(e) cannot be applied. I conclude that the partial mitigation available \nunder AG \u00b6 20(b) and (c) is insufficient to mitigate the security concerns regarding \nfinancial considerations. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate the \napplicant\u2019s security eligibility by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all \nthe circumstances. I have evaluated the facts presented and have applied the \nappropriate adjudicative factors under the cited guideline. I have also reviewed the \nrecord before me in the context of the whole-person factors listed in AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \n\n \n6 \n \n \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \n \nApplicant is presumed to be a mature, responsible adult. She accrued significant \ndebt over the past nine years: the SOR lists debts that total more than $93,000. \nApplicant claims she is unable to pay them because of insufficient funds, despite having \napproximately $400 remaining each month in discretionary funds. Applicant has not \nindicated that she sought financial counseling, and has no payment plans in place. Her \nlack of effort to resolve her legitimate financial obligations raises questions as to her \ngood judgment and reliability, and her suitability to be granted access to classified \ninformation. \n \n \n A fair and common-sense assessment of the available information bearing on \nApplicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance shows she has not satisfied the doubts \nabout her ability or willingness to protect the government\u2019s interests. Because protection \nof the national interest is paramount in these determinations, such doubts must be \nresolved in favor of the government.7 \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by section \nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are as follows: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a: - 1.l.  \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the foregoing, it is not clearly consistent with the national interest \nto allow Applicant access to classified information. Applicant\u2019s request for a security \nclearance is denied. \n \n \n \n \n_\n \nRITA C.

The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the Adjudicative Guidelines\n(AG) implemented in September 2006. \nApplicant timely answered the SOR and requested a decision without a hearing.\nOn June 6, 2011, the Government requested a hearing pursuant to the Directive. DOHA\nassigned the case to me on July 7, 2011. DOHA issued a Notice of Hearing on July 18,\n2011, and I convened the hearing on August 16, 2011. Department Counsel offered\nthree exhibits, which were admitted as Government Exhibits (GE) 1-3. Applicant\ntestified, presented one witness, and submitted six exhibits (AE), A through F, which\nwere admitted into the record. DOHA received the transcript on August 24, 2011. Based\non a review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified\ninformation is granted.\nSeptember 19, 2011\n\n2\nFindings of Fact\nIn her answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the factual allegation under\nGuideline E (Personal Conduct). Applicant is a 48-year-old employee of a defense\ncontractor. She received her undergraduate degree in May 2004. She has never\nmarried and has no children. Applicant has worked for her current employer since 1988.\nShe has held a security clearance for almost 26 years. (Tr. 38)\nApplicant readily acknowledges that she is in a committed relationship with A.G.,\nwho has an extensive history of involvement with criminal activities. He has lived with\nher in a committed relationship for 24 years. She has known him since 1988. (Tr. 22)\nShe is aware of his criminal past and his 2005 conviction for possession of crack\ncocaine, for which he was imprisoned for eight years. However, she did not know all the\ndetails of all the charges and convictions over the years. \nIn July 1998, as part of a security clearance investigation, Applicant told the\nOffice of Personnel (OPM) interviewers about her relationship with A.G. She\nacknowledged that she knew about the bank robbery and his drug problem. Applicant\ntestified that she did not understand that continuing a relationship with A.G. might\njeopardize her security clearance. She knew about his background. She cared for him\nand believed that he would change. She acknowledged that it might not be a good idea\nto continue a relationship with A.G. She also thought about leaving him if his behavior\ndid not change. (Tr. 43) However, she wanted to be a \u201chero\u201d and savior for him. From\n1994 until 2005, A.G. was free of any criminal charges or convictions. (GE 3)\nA.G. had been arrested five times before he met Applicant. In 1971 and 1982,\nhe was convicted of bank robbery. During the relationship, A.G. was in and out of jail\napproximately five times. Applicant visited him once a week while he was in jail. While\nApplicant and A.G. lived together, his criminal record included a 1988 assault with intent\nto maim; a 1989 possession of controlled substance and assault and battery; a 1991\npossession of unregistered ammunition with no permit; a 1991 charges of petty larceny,\ngrand larceny, and burglary; a 1993 breaking and entering; a 1994 possession of\nheroin; a 1994 possession of a pistol; and a 2003 grand larceny. (GE 3):\nAt the hearing, Applicant testified that she has been a faithful employee for 23\nyears and would never risk her security clearance or destroy all that she has achieved\nin her professional life by distributing classified information to her friend. She noted the\nrelationship with him on all security clearance applications.\nShe also submitted documentation that shows A.G. has made great strides in a\npositive direction to put his criminal activities behind him. After his 2005 arrest and\nconviction for possession of crack cocaine, he was confined in prison until 2008. He\ncompleted a residential drug rehabilitation program in 2009. (AE B) A.G. completed the\nDrug Offender Workforce Development Program in 2010. (AE D) He completed a\nmatrix social support program in December 2010. (AE C) She testified that she has\nseen a definite change in A.G since the 2005 drug arrest. She attributes this change to\nhis employment and his drug rehabilitation. He also does not have the same friends.\n\n3\n(Tr. 57) Applicant was credible describing her current relationship with A.G, which now\ninvolves them in family activities with his sister. (Tr. 57)\nAt the hearing, Applicant testified that she never saw AG use drugs and that she\ndid not have drugs in her home. When she first met him, she did not know he had an\nextensive drug problem. She later learned he had a heroin addiction. (Tr. 23) She\nadmitted that she also asked him about property (jewelry) in the house that she thought\nmight be stolen. She saw an unassembled gun in the home. At the time, he was a\nconvicted felon and was not allowed to own a gun. Applicant did not report this to\nauthorities because it was unassembled. (Tr. 31)\nA.G. testified at the hearing that he has lived with Applicant since 1988. He\nconsiders her his fiancee, and describes her as a compassionate and loyal person. He\ndescribed his full-time employment and his certification in HVAC. He completed the\napprentice course in 2011. (AE A) \nA.G. acknowledged that his criminal behavior began in 1971 when he was\nconvicted of bank robbery. He admitted all his other convictions and his drug problems\nwith heroin and cocaine. (Tr. 65) He stated that he never used drugs in Applicant\u2019s\npresence. He testified credibly that he is now working hard to do the right thing as a\ncitizen. He works seven days a week and continues to go to school. He does not\nassociate with the same friends. He has not used drugs since 2005. He was released\nfrom prison in 2008. He continues with drug counseling and attends meetings. He\nmeets with his probation officer once a month and is subject to random urinalysis. (Tr.\n69) He is also subject to random home visits. His probation ends in 2011. A.G. appears\nsincere in his devotion to Applicant and his desire to remain drug free. He has a support\nsystem and has resources to keep him on the right path. \nApplicant\u2019s colleague, who is a lieutenant colonel (retired), and who has known\nher for ten years, praises her professionalism and trustworthiness. He has known her in\na professional and a personal capacity. He describes Applicant\u2019s strong work ethic and\nloyalty. During her long tenure with the company, she has safeguarded classified\ninformation without incident. Applicant is described a successful leader. (AE E)\nAnother character reference presented details about Applicant\u2019s efficiency,\ncompetency, and organization. She is described as an honest and well-balanced\nperson. (AE F)\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, an\nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief\nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially\ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions. These guidelines are not inflexible\nrules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, they are applied\nin conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. An administrative\njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision.\n\n See also ISCR Case No. 94-1075 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Aug. 10, 1995).\n      1\n Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988).\n      2\n ISCR Case No. 93-1390 at 7-8 (App. Bd. Jan. 27, 1995).\n      3\n See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive\n      4\ninformation), and EO 10865 \u00a7 7.\n ISCR Case No. 93-1390 at 7-8 (App. Bd. Jan. 27, 1995).\n      5\n Id.\n      6\n4\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), this process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables\nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d An administrative judge must consider all\navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and\nunfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based\non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nThe Government must present evidence to establish controverted facts alleged\nin the SOR. An applicant is responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to\nrebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by\nDepartment Counsel. . . .\u201d  The burden of proof is something less than a\n1\npreponderance of evidence.  The ultimate burden of persuasion is on the applicant.  \n2\n3\nA person seeking access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government based on trust and confidence. This relationship\ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government\nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk\nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect classified information. Such\ndecisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, rather\nthan actual, risk of compromise of classified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d  \u201cThe clearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance\n4\ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d  Any reasonable doubt\n5\nabout whether an applicant should be allowed access to sensitive information must be\nresolved in favor of protecting such information.  The decision to deny an individual a\n6\nsecurity clearance does not necessarily reflect badly on an applicant\u2019s character. It is\n\n5\nmerely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President\nand the Secretary of Defense established for issuing a clearance.\nAnalysis\nGuideline E, Personal Conduct\nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern pertaining to personal conduct:\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect\nclassified information.\nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be\ndisqualifying:\n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from\nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or\nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment\nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance\neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities;\n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information concerning\nrelevant facts to an employer, investigator, security official, competent\nmedical authority, or other official government representative;\n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is\nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single\nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-\nperson \nassessment \nof \nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness,\nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and\nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the person may not\nproperly safeguard protected information;\n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any\nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse\ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information\nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment,\nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply\nwith rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the\nperson may not properly safeguard protected information. This includes\nbut is not limited to consideration of:\n(1) untrustworthy or unreliable behavior to include breach of\nclient confidentiality, release of proprietary information,\n\n6\nunauthorized release of sensitive corporate or other\ngovernment protected information;\n(2) disruptive, violent, or other inappropriate behavior in the\nworkplace; \n(3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations; and\n(4) evidence of significant misuse of Government or other\nemployer's time or resources;\n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one's conduct,\nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress, such\nas (1) engaging in activities which, if known, may affect the person's\npersonal, professional, or community standing, or (2) while in another\ncountry, engaging in any activity that is illegal in that country or that is\nlegal in that country but illegal in the United States and may serve as a\nbasis for exploitation or pressure by the foreign security or intelligence\nservice or other group;\n(f) violation of a written or recorded commitment made by the individual to\nthe employer as a condition of employment; and\n(g) association with persons involved in criminal activity. \nApplicant has lived with A.G., a person with an extensive criminal history, since\n1989. She disclosed this information on her security clearance applications from the\nstart of her career. She knew of his criminal activities. AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(d) and (g) apply.   \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns:\n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission,\nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts;\n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was\ncaused or significantly contributed to by improper or inadequate advice of\nauthorized personnel or legal counsel advising or instructing the individual\nspecifically concerning the security clearance process. Upon being made\naware of the requirement to cooperate or provide the information, the\nindividual cooperated fully and truthfully;\n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is\nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is\nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability,\ntrustworthiness, or good judgment;\n\n7\n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling\nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the\nstressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable,\nor other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur;\n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate\nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress;\n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable\nreliability; and\n(g) association with persons involved in criminal activity has ceased or\noccurs under circumstances that do not cast doubt upon the individual's\nreliability, trustworthiness, judgment, or willingness to comply with rules\nand regulations.\nApplicant has held a security clearance for almost 26 years. She has received\nhigh praise from her colleagues. When she completed her security clearance\napplications she listed A.G. as the person with whom she lived. Although A.G. had a\ncriminal history before Applicant met him, he continued his criminal behavior during\ntheir relationship. She acknowledged in 1998 that it might not be a good idea to\ncontinue the relationship with him. However, she believed he would change, and she\ncared for him. He had a drug problem, which also contributed to his robbery and theft\ncharges. Applicant remained faithful to him and visited him in jail. From 1994 until 2005,\nA.G. did not have any criminal incidents. However, in 2005, he again was sent to prison\nfor a drug charge. He served his time, completed a drug rehabilitation program, and is\nnow working. Although it may have been more prudent to leave the relationship,\nApplicant did not. Her strong commitment to A.G. may not be totally understandable,\nbut is not untrustworthy behavior. She did not associate with any of his friends. She did\nnot associate with his drug use. She was as loyal and supportive to him as she\napparently has been to her profession. She has a long, unblemished professional and\npersonal record. A.G. has changed his behavior and is on the right track. I do not have\ndoubts about Applicant\u2019s reliability or willingness to comply with rules and regulations. I\nfind that she has mitigated the concerns under personal conduct.\nWhole-Person Concept\nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of an applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\n\n8\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a\nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. As noted above, the\nultimate burden of persuasion is on the applicant seeking a security clearance. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case as well as the \u201cwhole-person\u201d\nfactors. Applicant has held a security clearance for almost 26 years without incident.\nShe has excellent recommendations and a stellar career record. She was forthright and\nhonest in her security investigations from the beginning. She told investigators in 1998\nthat she was living with A.G. She did not dispute his criminal record, but did not realize\nthe relationship might jeopardize her security clearance. She discussed the situation\nwith A.G. and wanted to help him. She did not associate herself with his friends. She\ndid not know all the specifics of his crimes. She did visit him in jail. She knew about his\naddiction to heroin. She at no time believed she had a duty to report him to the\nauthorities. \nFrom 1994 until 2005, A.G. had no criminal incidents. He has had one arrest in\n16 years. After his 2005 charge and time in prison, he appears to have taken his drug\nproblem seriously. He has attended drug rehabilitation. He has been drug free since\n2005. He is employed. He completes his probation this year. He testified at the hearing\nand is aware of the importance of Applicant\u2019s security clearance. He respects her work\nand did not involve Applicant in his criminal activities. He knows the value of Applicant\u2019s\nsecurity clearance and during the relationship with her he did not engage in criminal\nacts in the home. He was sincere in his desire to \u201cdo the right things as a citizen.\u201d He\nnow has resources to keep him on the right path.\nApplicant is not vulnerable to any coercion or pressure. She has disclosed the\nextent of her relationship over the years. She has had no incidents in 26 years while\nholding a security clearance. Applicant has met her burden. She has mitigated the\nsecurity concerns under personal conduct. Clearance is granted.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline E:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\n\n9\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant a security clearance.\nClearance is granted. \n                                                     \nNOREEN A.

Duffy, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nCURRY, Marc E., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant mitigated the government\u2019s financial considerations security concern.\nClearance is granted.\nStatement of the Case\nOn April 13, 2010, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under Guideline\nF, Financial Considerations. DOHA took the action under Executive Order 10865,\nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended;\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the\nadjudicative guidelines (AG).\nApplicant answered the SOR on May 3, 2010. He admitted SOR subparagraphs\n1.b, and 1.e through 1.g, and denied the remainder. He requested a hearing, and the\ncase was assigned to me on May 28, 2010. On June 8, 2010, a notice of hearing was\nAugust 31, 2010   \n\nThey remained legally divorced.\n1\n2\nissued scheduling the case for June 28, 2010. The hearing was conducted as\nscheduled. I received nine Government exhibits, ten Applicant exhibits, and Applicant\u2019s\ntestimony. At the conclusion of the hearing, I left the record open at Applicant\u2019s request,\nto allow him to submit additional exhibits. Within the time allotted, he submitted 13\nadditional exhibits that I received as Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AE) K through W. DOHA\nreceived the transcript on July 7, 2010.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 45-year-old married man with one adult child, age 20. Over the\nyears, he has attended approximately two and a half years of college. (GE 1 at 3) For\nthe past two years, he has worked as a facilities manager for a federal government\ncontractor. (Tr. 19) He has been in this line of work for 19 years.\nApplicant is highly respected on the job. The branch head of the agency where\nhe works characterizes him as \u201can asset to the Command.\u201d (AE L) According to the\nprogram manager, Applicant \u201chas been an asset to [the] team from day one, by tackling\nassignments with dedication and professionalism.\u201d (AE M)\nApplicant married in 1990. (AE A) He and his wife divorced in 1995, then\nreconciled in approximately 2000.  While they were back together, they financed the\n1\npurchase of two cars and opened a joint credit card account. \nSometime in 2001, Applicant and his wife\u2019s relationship again deteriorated,\nprompting Applicant to move out of the home. Enraged, his estranged spouse then\nintentionally overspent the credit limit on their credit card and failed to pay for any of the\npurchases. (AE 8 at 10) In sum, she charged about $7,000 of merchandise to the credit\ncard. (Tr. 48) Over the years, this account remained in delinquent status. By 2008, it\nhad accrued to $9,400, as listed in SOR subparagraph 1.e. \nAfter leaving his wife, Applicant moved into an apartment. In 2003, he subleased\nthe apartment to his roommate. (Tr. 22, 45) Applicant moved from the apartment with\nthree months left on the lease with the understanding that his friend would continue to\nmake the rental payments. His friend did not do so, prompting the property manager to\ninitiate eviction proceedings. After obtaining multiple judgments, as listed in SOR\nsubparagraphs 1.b through 1.d, the property manager evicted Applicant\u2019s friend from\nthe home. Because Applicant\u2019s name was on the lease, the judgments were entered\nagainst him. As of April 2010, the balance on the judgments was $2,821. (AE 10 at 2) \nWhen Applicant and his wife separated the second time, they agreed to split their\ncar payments with Applicant making the payments on the car that he kept and his wife\nmaking the payments on the car she kept. \n\nThe furniture bill, the utility bill, the miscellaneous judgment, and the federal income tax delinquencies are\n2\nnot listed on the SOR.\n3\nApplicant paid off his car note as agreed. Unbeknownst to him, however, his ex-\nwife stopped making payments on her car. In January 2006, the creditor obtained a\njudgment against Applicant and his ex-wife for $13,324, as listed in SOR subparagraph\n1.a.\nBy early 2008, Applicant had accrued approximately $33,000 of delinquent debt.\nIn addition to the debts listed above, his delinquencies included a $238 bill owed to a\nveterinarian, as listed in SOR subparagraph 1.f; a $598 credit card account, as listed in\nSOR subparagraph 1.g; a furniture rental and a two utility bills totalling approximately\n$2,100; a miscellaneous judgment for $623; debt owed to a bank for $3,370; and\n$2,000 in back federal income taxes for tax years 2005 and 2006.  (Tr. 59; GE 3 at 4-5,\n2\nGE 7 at 8)\nIn November 2008, Applicant retained a credit counseling agency to help him\ndevelop a debt satisfaction plan. (Tr. 52) With the help of the credit counselor, he\nsatisfied approximately $6,000 of delinquent debt by the end of 2009 including the\nveterinarian bill, the furniture rental bill, the two utility bills, the miscellaneous judgment,\nand the debt owed to the bank. (AE F; GE 7 at 8-9) \nIn April 2010, Applicant negotiated a reduction in the amount due to the creditor\nlisted in SOR subparagraph 1.a . Under the agreement, the creditor reduced the amount\ndue to $4,000. (AE A) Over an 18-month period, Applicant is to make monthly payments\nof $233. (AE Q) As of the hearing date, Applicant had made one $500 down payment\nand two monthly payments for $233. (AE Q)\nIn June 2010, Applicant arranged to satisfy the judgments listed in SOR\nsubparagraphs 1.b through 1.d with $100 monthly payments. He made the first\npayment, as scheduled, on June 29, 2010. (AE R)\nApplicant had trouble locating the current collection agent for the account listed in\nSOR subparagraph 1.e. After more than a year of research, he located the creditor, and\nnegotiated a balance reduction from $9,400 to $2,468. (AE S) Under the settlement\nagreement, he will pay $100 monthly payments. As of the date of the hearing, he had\npaid the creditor $100, as scheduled. (Id.)\nSOR subparagraph 1.g is a credit card account for approximately $598. Applicant\nhas been unable to locate the current holder of this debt, and it is not listed on the\nrecord\u2019s most recent credit report. (GE 2)\nApplicant still owes the United States Internal Revenue Service (IRS)\napproximately $2,000. He has begun to satisfy this delinquency through monthly $305\npayments. (Tr. 61) It is unclear from the record when Applicant initiated these\npayments.\n\n4\nApplicant maintains a budget. (AE J) It lists approximately $650 remaining after\nexpenses, but does not include his monthly IRS payments. (Id.) Taking into account\nApplicant\u2019s IRS payments, he has approximately $340 remaining after expenses. His\nchecking account balance averages approximately $1,300 and he has approximately\n$250 in a savings account. (Tr. 57) \nApproximately three months before the hearing, Applicant began working at a\npart-time job as a security guard to supplement his income. (Tr. 58) He works 25 to 30\nextra hours per week. (Tr. 59)\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief\nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially\ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in evaluating an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a\nconscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d\nThe administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the\nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion for obtaining a favorable security\ndecision.\nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nUnder this guideline, \u201cfailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts,\nand meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about\nan individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information (AG\n\u00b6 18). Applicant\u2019s history of financial problems triggers the application of AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a),\n\u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts,\u201d and 19(c), \u201ca history of not meeting financial\nobligations.\u201d\n\n5\nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially applicable:\n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely\nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business\ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or\nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;\n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is\nunder control; and\n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or\notherwise resolve debts.\nApplicant\u2019s financial problems were not caused by extravagant spending.\nInstead, they were caused primarily when his disgruntled ex-wife purposely exceeded\nthe credit limit on a credit card for which they were jointly responsible. Applicant\u2019s\nfinancial problems were later exacerbated when his ex-wife failed to honor an\nagreement to make the car payments on a jointly-owned vehicle.\nIn 2008, Applicant consulted a credit counselor to help him confront his\ndelinquent debts. Since then, Applicant satisfied approximately $6,000 of delinquent\ndebt, and negotiated more than $9,000 of balance reductions. He was able to make this\nprogress in part through the extra income generated from a part-time job that he\nobtained as part of his efforts to confront his debt problem.\nAlthough Applicant has been unable to locate the current holder of the debt listed\nin SOR subparagraph 1.g, his income and savings are sufficient to satisfy this debt once\nhe locates the creditor. I was concerned that Applicant did not provide documentary\nevidence corroborating his IRS payments. However, Applicant\u2019s testimony regarding the\nIRS payments was credible in light of the ample corroborating evidence he provided to\nprove that he was satisfying the other debts. I conclude all of the above mitigating\nconditions apply.\nWhole-Person Concept\nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge should consider the\nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\n\n6\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nApplicant is an industrious individual who is respected on the job. His financial\nproblems were largely caused by circumstances beyond his control. Over the past two\nyears, he has addressed them by obtaining a part-time job to generate more income,\nretaining a credit counselor, and methodically satisfying the delinquencies. Upon\nevaluating this case in the context of the whole-person factors, I conclude Applicant has\nrehabilitated his financial situation. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.g:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.\n                                             \nMARC E. CURRY\nAdministrative Judge\n",

(Government Exhibits 1 and 2).  On May 8, 2009,\nthe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order\n10865 (as amended), and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated\nJanuary 2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant, which detailed\nthe reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the\nDirective that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a\nsecurity clearance for the Applicant and recommended referral to an Administrative\nJudge to determine whether a clearance should be denied or revoked.  \nThe Applicant responded to the SOR on June 11, 2009, and he requested a\nhearing before a DOHA Administrative Judge.  This case was assigned to the\nundersigned on July 1, 2009.  A notice of hearing was issued on July 8, 2009, and the\nhearing was scheduled for July 29, 2009.  At the hearing the Government presented six\nexhibits, referred to as Government Exhibits 1 through 6.  The Applicant presented\nthree exhibits, referred to as Applicant\u2019s Exhibits A through C.  He also testified on his\nown behalf.  The record remained open until close of business on August 12, 2009, to\nallow the Applicant the opportunity to submit additional documentation.  The Applicant\n\n2\nsubmitted one Post-Hearing Exhibit referred to as Applicant\u2019s Post-Hearing Exhibit A,\nwhich was admitted without objection.  The official transcript (Tr.) was received on\nAugust 13, 2009.\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nThe following Findings of Fact are based on the Applicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR,\nthe testimony and the exhibits.  The Applicant is 55 years old and has a Bachelor\u2019s\nDegree in Criminal Justice.  He is employed by a defense contractor as a Security\nGuard and is seeking to obtain a security clearance in connection with his employment. \nThe Government opposes the Applicant's request for a security clearance, on the\nbasis of allegations set forth in the Statement of Reasons (SOR).  After a complete and\nthorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of the same,\nthe following findings of fact are entered as to each paragraph and guideline in the\nSOR:\nParagraph 1 (Guideline F - Financial Considerations)  The Government alleges that the\nApplicant is ineligible for a security clearance because he is financially overextended\nand at risk to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nThe Applicant admits each of the allegations set forth in the SOR under this\nguideline.  He is indebted to nineteen separate creditors totalling approximately\n$100,000.00.  Credit reports of the Applicant dated June 19, 2008; February 9, 2009;\nand July 28, 2009, reflect each of these delinquent debts.  (Government Exhibits 3, 4, 5,\nand 6).  \nThe Applicant explained that from 1980 to October 2005, he and his wife owned\nand operated a small silk screen printing business, in a low income minority community.\nThey printed T-shirts for the local churches, schools and other organizations.  Over the\nyears, the business faced fires, floods, riots and other community mishaps, but the\nApplicant was able still able to make a decent living.  In 2005, although he did not want\nto close the business, he was forced to due to economic changes.  The landlord\nincreasingly raised the rent that started at $250.00 to $1,900.00 monthly.  Business\ntaxes were high.  The business equipment became old and outdated, and the Applicant\nwas unable acquire a small business loan to subsidize the needs of the business,\nnamely because of its location.  During difficult periods, he used his credit cards to\nfinance his company in order to stay in business.  This, he could not afford.  \nHe also had some tax problems.  In 2002, business was so bad he did not take\nhome a salary.  He made the mistake of filing his taxes and reporting no income for that\nyear.  The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) estimated his tax liability based on previous\nyears and he remains indebted for back taxes.  When the Applicant closed the\nbusiness, the job market was not good.  He found work as a security guard.  He has\nthought about filing bankruptcy to resolve his indebtedness, but was hesitant about it.\n\n3\nHe wanted to pay his debts, but has not had the money to do so. He contacted his\ncreditors and explained his situation to them, but they wanted to be paid.  His plan is to\ntake care of the IRS first and then address his other creditors.  The debts listed below\nand in the SOR were incurred as a result of his business.  \n1(a).\nThe Applicant is indebted to a creditor in the amount of $2,529.00 as of March\n23, 2009.  The debt remains outstanding.\n1(b).\nThe Applicant is indebted to a creditor in the amount of $847.00 as of March 23,\n2009.  The debt remains outstanding.\n1(c).\nThe Applicant is indebted to a creditor in the amount of $609.00 as of March 23,\n2009.  The debt remains outstanding.\n1(d).\nThe Applicant is indebted to a creditor in the amount of $1,378.00 as of March\n23, 2009.

The debt remains outstanding.\n1(g).\nThe Applicant is indebted to a creditor in the amount of $1,068.00 as of March\n23, 2009.  The debt remains outstanding.\n1(h).\nThe Applicant is indebted to a creditor in the amount of $1,395.00 as of March\n23, 2009.  The debt remains outstanding.\n1(i).\nThe Applicant is indebted to a creditor in the amount of $1,623.00 as of March\n23, 2009.  The debt remains outstanding.\n1(j).\nThe Applicant is indebted to a creditor in the amount of $219.00 as of March 23,\n2009.  The debt remains outstanding.\n1(k).\nIn January 2004, a judgment was entered against the Applicant in the amount of\n$1,787.00 and remains outstanding.  \n1(l).\nIn June 2006, a tax lien was issued against the Applicant in the amount of\n$22,590.00.  The Applicant attempted to make a payment to the IRS concerning this\ndebt.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit A).\n1(m). In August 2004, a judgment was entered against the Applicant in the amount of\n$11,781.00 and remains outstanding.\n\n4\n1(n).\nIn August 2004, a judgment was entered against the Applicant in the amount of\n$12,333.00 and remains outstanding.\n1(o).\nIn March 1996, a judgment was entered against the Applicant in the amount of\n$22,460.00 and remains outstanding.\n1(p).\nThe Applicant is indebted in the amount of $1,173.00 as of March 23, 2009.  The\ndebt remains outstanding. \n1(q).\nThe Applicant is indebted to a creditor in the amount of $932.00 as of March 23,\n2009.  The debt remains outstanding.\n1(r).\nThe Applicant is indebted to a creditor in the amount of $1,308.00 as of March\n23, 2009.  The debt remains outstanding.\n1(s).\nThe Applicant in indebted to a creditor in the amount of $114.00 as of March 23,\n2009.  The debt remains outstanding.   \nApplicant\u2019s Post-Hearing Exhibit A indicates that he has hired a consumer credit\ncounselor and is preparing the schedules to file for Chapter 7 bankruptcy.  He plans to\ninclude each of the debts listed in the SOR that can be discharged.  To reduce\nexpenses, the Applicant\u2019s wife has moved out of town to take care of her ailing parents. \nHer father recently passed away.  The Applicant moved into his elderly father\u2019s house\nand is paying him rent.  Applicant is staying current with his regular monthly expenses.\nHe credibly states that he would never do anything to jeopardize the national security,\nor to injure his company or his position with the defense contractor.    \nParagraph 2 (Guideline E - Personal Conduct).  The Government alleges that the\nApplicant is ineligible for clearance because he intentionally falsified material aspects of\nhis personal background during the clearance screening process.\nThe Applicant denies both of the allegations set forth under this guideline.  (See\nApplicant\u2019s Response to the SOR dated June 11, 2009).  The Applicant completed a\nQuestionnaire for National Security Positions dated October 11, 2007.  (Government\nExhibit 1).  Section 27(c) asked him if he had a lien placed against his property for\nfailing to pay taxes or other debts.  Section 27(d) asked him if in the last seven years\nhas he had any judgment against him that has not been paid.  The Applicant\nresponded, \u201cNO\u201d to both questions.  (Government Exhibit 1).  These were incorrect\nanswers.  The Applicant failed to disclose that he had judgments filed entered against\nhim in June 2008, and a state tax lien filed against him in June 2006.  \nQuestion 28(a) of the same questionnaire asked the Applicant if in the last seven\nyears he has been over 180 days delinquent on any debts.  Applicant failed to disclose\nthe debts set forth in the SOR under Guideline F. \n   \n\n5\nThe Applicant stated that when he completed the security clearance application,\nhe did not have a copy of his credit report.  (Tr. pp. 59 - 60).  He knew that he had\nbusiness related credit card debt, but he did not have a lien that he knew about.  He\nwas unaware of the specifics and/or had forgotten about them at the time he answered\nthe questions.  (See Applicant\u2019s Response to the SOR).  He did not deliberately fail to\ndisclose his indebtedness to the Government or his employer on the application.  He\nbelieved at the time that he was honest and forthright in answering the questions. \nA letter of recommendation from the Applicant\u2019s immediate supervisor indicates\nthat the Applicant is dependable, trustworthy and hardworking.  He is considered to be a\nvaluable asset to the organization and is highly recommended for a position of trust.\n(Applicant\u2019s Exhibit B).\nApplicant has received an award for outstanding performance on the job from the\ndefense contractor.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit C).  \nApplicant testified that from 1974 to 1981, he worked for the FBI.  He started as a\nclerical employee, ended up as a supervisor, and left on good terms.  (Tr. pp. 24 and\n28).     \nPOLICIES\nEnclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudication policies divided into \"Disqualifying\nFactors\" and \"Mitigating Factors.\"  The following Disqualifying Factors and Mitigating\nFactors are found to be applicable in this case:\nGuideline F (Financial Considerations)\n18.  The Concern.  Failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to\nabide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s\nreliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information.  An individual who\nis financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate\nfunds.  Compulsive gambling is a concern as it may lead to financial crimes including\nespionage.  Affluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a\nsecurity concern.  It may indicate proceeds from financially profitable criminal acts.\nConditions that could raise a security concern:\n19.(a)  inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts;\n19.(c)  a history of not meeting financial obligations.\n\n6\nConditions that could mitigate security concerns:\nNone.\nGuideline E (Personal Conduct)\n15.  The Concern.  Conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor,\ndishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified\ninformation.  Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful and candid answers\nduring the security clearance process or any other failure to cooperate with the security\nclearance process.\nConditions that could raise a security concern:\nNone.\nIn addition, as set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive at pages 16-17,  in\nevaluating the relevance of an individual\u2019s conduct, the Administrative Judge should\nconsider the following general factors:\na.  The nature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding circumstances\nb.  The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation\nc.  The frequency and recency of the conduct\nd.  The individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct\ne.  The voluntariness of participation\nf.  The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavior\nchanges\ng.  The motivation for the conduct \nh. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress\n \ni.  The likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nThe eligibility criteria established in the DoD Directive identify personal\ncharacteristics and conduct which are reasonably related to the ultimate question,\nposed in Section 2 of Executive Order 10865, of whether it is \u201cclearly consistent with the\nnational interest\u201d to grant an Applicant\u2019s request for access to classified information.\n\n7\nThe DoD Directive states, \u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a\nsufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the person is\nan acceptable security risk.  Eligibility for access to classified information is predicted\nupon the individual meeting these personnel security guidelines.  The adjudicative\nprocess is the careful weighing of a number of variables known as the whole person\nconcept.  Available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable\nand unfavorable should be considered in reaching a determination.\u201d The Administrative\nJudge can draw only those inferences or conclusions that have reasonable and logical\nbasis in the evidence of record.  The Judge cannot draw inferences or conclusions\nbased on evidence which is speculative or conjectural in nature.  Finally, as emphasized\nby President Eisenhower in Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under this order\n. . . shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a\ndetermination as to the loyalty of the Applicant concerned.\u201d\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn the defense industry, a security clearance is entrusted to civilian workers who\nmust be counted upon to safeguard such sensitive information twenty-four hours per\nday, seven days per week.  The Government is therefore appropriately concerned when\navailable information indicates that an Applicant for such access may be involved in\ninstances of financial irresponsibility and dishonesty which demonstrates poor judgment\nor unreliability.\nIt is the Government\u2019s responsibility to present substantial evidence to support\nthe finding of a nexus, or rational connection, between the Applicant\u2019s conduct and the\nholding of a security clearance.  If such a case has been established, the burden then\nshifts to the Applicant to go forward with evidence in rebuttal, explanation or mitigation\nwhich is sufficient to overcome or outweigh the Government\u2019s case.  The Applicant\nbears the ultimate burden of persuasion in proving that it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant him a security clearance.\nIn this case the Government has met its initial burden of proving that the\nApplicant has been financially irresponsible (Guideline F).  This evidence indicates poor\njudgment, unreliability and untrustworthiness on the part of the Applicant.  Because of\nthe scope and nature of the Applicant's conduct, I conclude there is a nexus or\nconnection with his security clearance eligibility.\nThe evidence shows that circumstances largely beyond his control contributed to\nhis financial difficulties.  After twenty-five years in a successful business, the Applicant\nwas forced to close his doors due to our poor economy.  When business slowed, real\nestate costs increased, small business loans were not available, and he incurred debts\nhe could not afford to pay.  Although he has obtained employment since then, he has\nnot been able to afford to pay his delinquent debt.  Recently, the Applicant has hired a\ncredit counselling company to assist him in resolving his indebtedness. He is currently\nworking on completing the schedules to file bankruptcy under Chapter 7, which should\n\n8\nrelieve him of his debts.  As soon as he is delinquent debt free and demonstrates a\npattern of financial responsibility he will be eligible to apply for access to classified\ninformation.  At the present time, however, the numerous debts listed in the SOR\nremain owing.     \nUpon review of his financial report, it appears that he has little in disposable\nincome at the end of the month to pay his delinquent bills.  Under Guideline F (Financial\nConsiderations), Disqualifying Conditions 19(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy\ndebts, and 19(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations are applicable.  None of\nthe mitigating conditions apply.  His financial problems remain current, they are not\nisolated, and the Applicant has not initiated a prompt, good faith effort to repay his\noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve his debts. \nI have also considered the \u201cwhole person concept\u201d in evaluating the Applicant\u2019s\neligibility for access to classified information.  Under the particular facts of this case, the\ntotality of the conduct set forth under all of the guidelines viewed as a whole, support a\nwhole person assessment of questionable judgement, untrustworthiness, unreliability,\nlack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other\ncharacteristics indicating that the person may not properly safeguard classified\ninformation.  The Applicant has recently begun the process of financial rehabilitation.\nAssuming he follows through with his bankruptcy and continues to demonstrate financial\nresponsibility, he may be eligible for access to classified information in the future, but\nnot at this time.    \nThe evidence further shows that the Applicant did not deliberately fail to disclose\nhis judgments and his tax liens on his security clearance application.  Based upon his\nhonesty, integrity and candid demeanor at the hearing, it was an obvious mistake on his\npart, not done intentionally or to conceal anything from his employer or the Government.\nAccordingly, I find for the Applicant under Guideline E.\n    \nIn total, the Applicant has not demonstrated that he is sufficiently trustworthy to\nmeet the eligibility requirements for access to classified information.  Accordingly, I find\nagainst the Applicant under Guideline F (Financial Considerations).  I find for the\nApplicant under Guideline E (Personal Conduct).  \nOn balance, it is concluded that the Applicant has failed to overcome the\nGovernment's case opposing his request for a security clearance.  Accordingly, the\nevidence supports a finding against the Applicant as to the factual and conclusionary\nallegations expressed in Paragraph 1 of the Government's Statement of Reasons.\nParagraph 2 is found for the Applicant.     \n\n9\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal findings For or Against the Applicant on the allegations in the SOR, as\nrequired by Paragraph 25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive are:\nParagraph 1: Against the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.a.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.b.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.c.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.d.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.e.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.f.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.g.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.h.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.i.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.j.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.k.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.l.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.m.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.n.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.o.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.p.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.q.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.r.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.s.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\nParagraph 2: For the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  2.a.:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  2.b.:\nFor the Applicant.\nDECISION\nIn light of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly\nconsistent with the national interests to grant or continue a security clearance for the\nApplicant.\n  Darlene Lokey Anderson\nAdministrative Judge\n",

On March 11, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns \nunder Guideline F, Financial Considerations, and Guideline E, Personal Conduct, for \nApplicant. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense \nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) \npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the \nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nOn April 1, 2009, Applicant answered the SOR and requested his case be \ndecided on the written record. Department Counsel prepared a File of Relevant Material \n(FORM) on May 5, 2009.  The FORM was forwarded to Applicant on May 6, 2009.  \nApplicant received the FORM on May 12, 2009. He had 30 days from receipt of the \nFORM to submit any additional material. He did not respond. The FORM was forwarded \nto the hearing office on July 7, 2009, and assigned to me on July 9, 2009. Based upon a \nJuly 30, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n \nreview of the case file, pleadings, and exhibits, eligibility for access to classified \ninformation is denied. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, dated April 1, 2009, Applicant admitted all of the SOR \nallegations. (Item 3)  \n \nApplicant is a 57-year-old engineer employed with a Department of Defense \ncontractor seeking to maintain a security clearance.  He has been employed with the \ndefense contractor since October 1987. He is widowed and has two adult children. (Item \n4)   \n \nOn October 2, 2008, Applicant completed an Electronic Questionnaires for \nSecurity Investigations Processing, (e-QIP). He answered \u201cNo\u201d in response to Section \n28.a \u201cIn the last 7 years, have you been over 180 days delinquent on any debt(s)?\u201d and \n\u201cNo\u201d in response to Section 28.b \u201cAre you currently 90 days delinquent on any debt(s)?\u201d \n(Item 4) \n \nApplicant\u2019s background investigation revealed the following delinquent accounts: \na $2,699 account placed for collection in November 2006 (SOR \u00b6 1.a: Item 5 at 5, 7; \nItem 6 at 1); a $1,304 credit card account that was charged off in November 2006 (SOR \n\u00b6 1.b: Item 5 at 4; Item 6 at 2; Item 7 at 1); a $4,735 credit card account that was \ncharged off in November 2006 (SOR \u00b6 1.c: Item 5 at 4; Item 6 at 2; Item 7 at 1); a \n$3,288 credit card account placed for collection in November 2006 (SOR \u00b6 1.d: Item 5 \nat 6; Item 6 at 2; Item 7 at 2); a $7,451 credit card account placed for collection in \nNovember 2006 (SOR \u00b6 1.e: Item 5 at 6; Item 6 at 2; Item 7 at 2); a $4,753 delinquent \naccount with a bank placed for collection in October 2006 (SOR \u00b6 1.f: Item 5 at 7); and \na $4,221 delinquent account with a bank placed for collection in October 2006. (SOR \u00b6 \n1.g: Item 5 at 7)   \n \nIn his response to the SOR, Applicant stated that he requested paperwork to \napply for a hardship withdrawal from his 401(k) savings plan. He did not meet any of the \ncriteria for a hardship withdrawal. He then requested a loan from his 401(k) savings \nplan. He has a pre-existing loan taken out in March 2006 for a period of five years. He \ncannot modify the loan and cannot pay the loan off in one lump sum. The current \nbalance is $4,600.  He claims he has no access to any other commercial or private \nsource to resolve his debts. (Item 3) \n \nApplicant admits that he deliberately omitted his delinquent debts in response to \nquestions 28.a and 28.b on his e-QIP application. He claimed:  \n \nLike I told the investigator, [Investigator\u2019s Name], on October 30, 2008, I \nfelt too embarrassed to acknowledge to anyone, family, friends or work, \nthat I had incurred that much of a financial obligation and was not able to \ncontinue to make payments.  (Item 3 at 1)  \n\n \n3 \n \n \n \nThe record evidence contains no information about Applicant\u2019s current financial \nsituation. There is no information in the record explaining the cause of Applicant\u2019s \nfinancial problems. No information was submitted regarding Applicant\u2019s work \nperformance.  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n  \n\n \n4 \n \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG & 18:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several disqualifying conditions that could raise security \nconcerns. I find Financial Considerations Disqualifying Condition (FC DC) &19(a) (an \ninability or unwillingness to satisfy debts); and FC DC &19(c) (a history of not meeting \nfinancial obligations) apply to Applicant\u2019s case. Applicant has seven delinquent \naccounts, totaling approximately $28,451. All of these debts have been delinquent since \n2006.  \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Financial Considerations Mitigating Condition \n(FC MC) \u00b6 20(a) (the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment) is not applicable. \nApplicant has a history of financial irresponsibility. He did not explain what caused his \nfinancial problems. There is nothing in the record evidence indicating Applicant\u2019s current \nfinancial status.  His delinquent accounts remain unresolved.   \n \n \nBased on the record evidence, I conclude FC MC & 20(b) (the conditions that \nresulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of \nemployment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce \nor separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances) does not \napply. It appears that all of Applicant\u2019s delinquent accounts became delinquent in 2006. \nHowever, Applicant did not explain what caused his financial problems. I cannot \nconclude that there were circumstances beyond Applicant\u2019s control contributed to his \nfinancial problems.  \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \n     \nFC MC \u00b620(c) (the person has received or is receiving counseling for the \nproblem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under \ncontrol) does not apply. There is no evidence that Applicant attended financial \ncounseling.  All of the debts remain delinquent. It is unlikely that his financial problems \nwill be resolved in the near future.  \n \nFC MC &20(d) (the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue \ncreditors or otherwise resolve debts) partially applies. Applicant attempted to obtain a \nhardship withdrawal from his 401(k). He did not qualify for a hardship withdrawal so he \nthen attempted to obtain a loan against his 401(k). He already had borrowed against his \n401(k) and did not qualify for an additional loan. Regardless of these efforts, Applicant \nclaims that he cannot resolve these accounts. For this reason, FC MC \u00b6 20(d) is given \nless weight.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s failure to honor his financial obligations remains a security concern. \nHe has not mitigated the security concerns raised under financial considerations.  \n \nPersonal Conduct \n \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in \nAG &15: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \n \nPersonal conduct concerns are raised because Applicant deliberately omitted his \ndelinquent debts that were over 180 days old in response to section 28.a and his \ndelinquent debts that were currently 90 days old in response to section 28.b on his e-\nQIP application, dated October 2, 2008. Personal Conduct Disqualifying Condition \u00b6 \n16(a) (deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any \npersonnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to \nconduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status, \ndetermine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary \nresponsibilities) applies to this allegation. Applicant admits that he did not list his \ndelinquent accounts because he was too embarrassed to admit that he had incurred \nthat much debt.   \n \n \nNone of the mitigating conditions apply under Guideline E. Guideline E is found \nagainst Applicant.  \n \n \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant provided no information \nabout his work performance. All seven debts alleged in the SOR remain unresolved. \nApplicant did not explain the cause of his financial problems. He claims he is unable to \nresolve his delinquent accounts. Applicant\u2019s deliberate falsification of his security \nclearance application by omitting his delinquent debts raise security concerns under \npersonal conduct. Embarrassment does not excuse Applicant from providing truthful \ninformation on his security clearance application. Applicant failed to mitigate the security \nconcerns arising under financial considerations and personal conduct.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.e:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.f:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.g:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

Goldstein, Esq., Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro se\nJanuary 11, 2010\n______________\nDECISION\n______________\nROSS, Wilford H., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted her Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing\n(e-QIP) on March 18, 2008 (Government Exhibit 1). On April 3, 2009, the Defense\nOffice of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing\nthe security concerns under Guideline F concerning Applicant. The action was taken\nunder Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry\n(February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense\nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as\namended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the\nPresident on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for\nSORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on April 28, 2009, and requested a\nhearing before an administrative judge.  Department Counsel was prepared to proceed\non May 12, 2009.  This case was assigned to me on May 13, 2009.  DOHA issued a\nnotice of hearing on May 29, 2009, and I convened the hearing as scheduled on July 2,\n2009. The Government offered Government Exhibits 1 through 6, which were received\n\nThe records show two Agency B accounts with the number 3018. See \u00b6 1.f., below.\n1\n2\nwithout objection. Applicant testified on her own behalf, called one additional witness,\nand submitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibits A through H, also without objection.  DOHA received\nthe transcript of the hearing, and the record closed, on July 14, 2009.  Based upon a\nreview of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to\nclassified information is granted.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is 57 and married. She is employed by a defense contractor and seeks\nto retain a security clearance in connection with her employment. \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe Government alleges that Applicant is ineligible for clearance because she is\nfinancially overextended and therefore at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to\ngenerate funds. Applicant admits SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a., 1.b., 1.f., 1.g., and 1.i. Those admissions\nare hereby deemed findings of fact. She denies SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c., 1.d., 1.e., and 1.h. \nApplicant testified about her financial situation. She stated, \u201cI was married for\nalmost 25 years, and we got a divorce, and I got very depressed, and people were\ngiving me charge cards, so I went shopping. I know it was wrong but I did it.\u201d (Transcript\nat 44-45.)\n1.a.\nApplicant admits that she is indebted to credit card company A (Company\nA) in the amount of $604 for account number 3906. She has not contacted this creditor\nin the recent past. Applicant has not paid this debt, but intends to pay it when she is\nfinancially able to do so. As further set forth below, this is the same debt as \u00b6 1.d.\n(Government Exhibit 5 at 2, Applicant\u2019s Exhibit D, Transcript at 47-51.)\n1.b.\nApplicant admits that she is indebted to Company A in the amount of $517\nfor a second credit card with account number 5152. She has not contacted this creditor\nin the recent past. Applicant has not paid this debt, but intends to pay it when she is\nfinancially able to do so. As further set forth below, this is the same debt as \u00b6 1.f.\n(Government Exhibit 5 at 2; Transcript at 51.)\n1.c.\nApplicant denied that she owed this medical debt in the amount of $4,885\nfor account number 0547. The available records show that this debt is actually a\nduplicate of \u00b6\u00b6 1.h. and 1.i. Further discussion will be found under \u00b6 1.h., below. This\nallegation is found for Applicant because it is a duplicate.\n1.d.\nApplicant denied that she is indebted to collection agency B (Agency B) in\nthe amount of $1,183 for account number 3018.   Available records, particularly\n1\nApplicant\u2019s Exhibit D, show that this is the same debt as that set forth in \u00b6 1.a., above.\n\nApplicant alleged in her testimony that Applicant\u2019s Exhibit B applied to \u00b61.i. of the SOR. The evidentiary\n2\nrecord shows that the exhibit does not apply to that allegation.\n3\nThis allegation is found for Applicant because it is a duplicate. (Government Exhibit 4;\nApplicant\u2019s Exhibit D; Transcript at 53-58.)\n1.e.\nApplicant denied that she is indebted to Agency B in the amount of $2,371\nfor account number 2995. Available records show that this is the same debt as\nCompany A account number 1553. That Company A account is not alleged separately\nin the SOR. I find that this is Applicant\u2019s debt, and that she has made no recent\npayments on this debt. (Government Exhibit 5; Applicant\u2019s Exhibit E; Transcript at 53-\n58.)\n1.f.\nApplicant admitted that she is indebted to Agency B in the amount of\n$1,068 for the second account number 3018.  Available records show that this is the\nsame debt as Company A account number 5152 (\u00b6 1.b., above.) This allegation is found\nfor the Applicant because it is a duplicate debt. (Government Exhibit 5; Transcript at 53-\n58.)\n1.g.\nApplicant admits that she is indebted to collection agency C (Agency C) in\nthe amount of $1,689 for a delinquent debt.  Applicant testified that she intends to pay\nthis debt as soon as she has the money, but that she has made no recent payments on\nthis debt. (Government Exhibit 4; Applicant\u2019s Exhibit C; Transcript at 58-62.)\n1.h.\nApplicant denied that she is indebted to collection agency D (Agency D) in\nthe amount of $5,953 for account number 0547.  As stated above, this is the same debt\nas that set forth in \u00b6\u00b6 1.c. and 1.i. Based on the available evidence, I find that this is\nApplicant\u2019s debt, and that she has made no recent payments on this debt. (Government\nExhibit 3 at 6, Exhibit 4 at 2; Applicant\u2019s Exhibit G; Transcript at 52-53, 63-64, 75.)\n1.i.\nApplicant admits that she was indebted to collection agency E (Agency E)\nfor a delinquent debt in the amount of $4,551 for account number 0547. The records\nshow that this particular account is a duplicate of \u00b6\u00b6 1.c, and 1.f. This allegation is found\nfor Applicant because it is a duplicate. (Government Exhibit 3 at 7.)\nApplicant submitted additional documentary information concerning three other\naccounts. One of these accounts she successfully paid off in 2008. (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit\nB; Transcript at 61-63.)  She also submitted documents concerning two other past due\n2\naccounts, neither one of which is alleged in the SOR. (Applicant\u2019s Exhibits F and H.)\nApplicant testified that she worked with a debt-consolidation company in\napproximately 2002. She stopped using them after three months because she\nconcluded that the company was actually a scam. (Transcript at 60-61.) Applicant also\ntestified that she was uncertain which collection agencies were collecting for which\ndebts. (Transcript at 48-50.) As described above, four of the debts alleged in the SOR\nare actually duplicates of other allegations.\n\nSee Testimony by Applicant\u2019s husband. (Transcript at 23-41.)\n3\n4\nApplicant maintains, and records show, that she is able to pay her regular debts.\nShe credibly testified that she pays her past due debts as she has available funds.\n(Applicant\u2019s Exhibit A; Transcript at 50-51.)3\nPolicies\nSecurity clearance decisions are not made in a vacuum. When evaluating an\napplicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the administrative judge must consider\nthe revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief introductory explanations for\neach guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and\nmitigating conditions, which are to be used as appropriate in evaluating an applicant\u2019s\neligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision. In addition, the administrative judge may also rely on his own\ncommon sense, as well as his knowledge of the law, human nature, and the ways of the\nworld, in making a reasoned decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based\non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Security clearance decisions include, by\n\n5\nnecessity, consideration of the possible risk that the applicant may deliberately or\ninadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a\ncertain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk\nof compromise of classified information.\n \nFinally, as emphasized in Section 7 of Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny\ndetermination under this order . . . shall be a determination in terms of the national\ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant\nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access\nto classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set\nout in AG & 18:      \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and\nmeet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment,\nor unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nAG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.\nSimilarly under AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise\nsecurity concerns. Applicant, by her own admission, and supported by the documentary\nevidence, has $11,134 in past-due debts, all of which have been due and owing for\nseveral years. The evidence is sufficient to raise these potentially disqualifying\nconditions.\nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security\nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG \u00b6 20(a), the disqualifying condition\nmay be mitigated where Athe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or\noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt\non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ Applicant=s\nfinancial difficulties arose about eight to ten years ago, primarily between 1999-2002. In\naddition, Applicant stated that many of these debts arose because she used poor\njudgment after a divorce. She has remarried, paid off one of the past due debts, evinced\na credible and believable intent to pay off her remaining past due indebtedness, and her\ncurrent financial situation is stable. This mitigating condition applies to this case. \nAG \u00b6 20(b) states that the disqualifying conditions may be mitigated where \u201cthe\nconditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s\n\n6\ncontrol (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical\nemergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual acted responsibly\nunder the circumstances.\u201d  As stated above, the Applicant\u2019s divorce did enter into her\nspending habits sometime in the past. As further stated, those stressors no longer are in\nher life and she now uses good spending habits. This mitigating condition also applies.\nApplicant has initiated a good-faith effort to pay off her creditors, albeit slowly.\nThe record supports her concern that the true creditors are hard to find. As set forth\nabove, four of the allegations in the SOR were duplicates (\u00b6\u00b6 1.c., 1.d., 1.f., and 1.i.).\nThe SOR alleged a past due indebtedness of $22,821. The figure supported by the\nevidence is actually $11,134. Accordingly, AG \u00b6 20(d) is applicable.  \nApplicant is over $11,000 in debt. However, the record is clear that she is not\nrunning up new debt. Indeed, she is paying her debts as her financial situation allows\nher to do so. Under the particular circumstances of this case, I find that \u201cthere are clear\nindications that the problem is being resolved or is under control,\u201d as required by AG \u00b6\n20(c).\nWhole-Person Concept\nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the relevant circumstances. Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination\nof whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance must be an overall commonsense\njudgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person\nconcept. The administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors\nlisted at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.      \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe relevant facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant engaged in\nspending above her means after a divorce ten years ago. She has stopped this conduct,\nand her current financial condition is stable. Under AG \u00b6 2(a)(3), Applicant\u2019s\nirresponsible conduct is not recent, although some old debt remains unpaid.  Based on\nthe record, I find that there have been permanent behavioral changes under AG \u00b6\n2(a)(6). Accordingly, at the present time, I find that there is little to no potential for\npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress (AG \u00b6 2(a)(8); and that there is no likelihood\nof recurrence (AG \u00b6 2(a)(9). \n\n7\nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with no questions or doubts as to\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I\nconclude Applicant has mitigated the security concerns arising from her financial\nsituation at this time.\nOn balance, I conclude that Applicant has successfully overcome the\nGovernment's case opposing her request for a security clearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is a 27-year-old single man with no children. He has a high school education, and is currently taking college courses (Item 5 at 11). Since 2006, he has worked as a security guard. Applicant owes 14 creditors approximately $9,500 in delinquent debt, including, among other things, utility bills (SOR subparagraphs 1.a, 1.d, 1.g, and 1.l), debts owed to banks (SOR subparagraphs 1.c, 1.e, 1.i, and 1.j), and department store credit cards (SOR subparagraphs 1.f and 1.h). He denies the debt alleged in SOR subparagraph 1.f, in the amount of $575. The government\u2019s contention that he owes this debt is supported by page 12 of Item 6. Applicant provided no documentary evidence supporting his denial. Consequently, I included this delinquency in calculating his total delinquent debt. Applicant also denied SOR subparagraph 1.k, a delinquency allegedly owed to a furniture store for $415. He provided documentary evidence supporting his contention that he had satisfied it by June 2006 (Exhibit 6 at 6). Applicant contends he has been making payments to satisfy SOR subparagraphs 1.g and 1.l. He provided no supporting documentary evidence.

Clearance is denied.\nOn April 16, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under Guideline\nF, Financial Considerations. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865,\nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended;\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised\nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and\neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \nApplicant answered the SOR on May 13, 2009, admitting all of the allegations\nexcept subparagraphs 1.f and 1.k. He requested an administrative determination. On\nJune 11, 2009, Department Counsel prepared a File of Relevant Material (FORM).\nDOHA mailed a copy of the FORM to Applicant on June 12, 2009. He received it on\nSeptember 30, 2009\n\n2\nJune 25, 2009 along with instructions to file any objections or supplementary\ninformation within 30 days. Applicant did not respond, and the case was assigned to me\non September 4, 2009.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 27-year-old single man with no children. He has a high school\neducation, and is currently taking college courses (Item 5 at 11). Since 2006, he has\nworked as a security guard.\nApplicant owes 14 creditors approximately $9,500 in delinquent debt, including,\namong other things, utility bills (SOR subparagraphs 1.a, 1.d, 1.g, and 1.l), debts owed\nto banks (SOR subparagraphs 1.c, 1.e, 1.i, and 1.j), and department store credit cards\n(SOR subparagraphs 1.f and 1.h). He denies the debt alleged in SOR subparagraph 1.f,\nin the amount of $575. The government\u2019s contention that he owes this debt is supported\nby page 12 of Item 6. Applicant provided no documentary evidence supporting his\ndenial. Consequently, I included this delinquency in calculating his total delinquent debt.\nApplicant also denied SOR subparagraph 1.k, a delinquency allegedly owed to a\nfurniture store for $415. He provided documentary evidence supporting his contention\nthat he had satisfied it by June 2006 (Exhibit 6 at 6). Applicant contends he has been\nmaking payments to satisfy SOR subparagraphs 1.g and 1.l. He provided no supporting\ndocumentary evidence.\nApplicant was unemployed for approximately a year and a half, from January\n2002 through July 2003 (Item 5 at 20). At or about this time, four of the debts listed in\nthe SOR (subparagraphs 1.d, 1.e, 1.f, and 1.k) grew delinquent (see generally, Item 8).\nThere is no record evidence of the circumstances surrounding the unemployment. \nIn response to interrogatories that the government propounded, Applicant\nprovided a budget. Although it indicates that Applicant has $40 of after-expense monthly\nincome, it includes neither the purported monthly payments toward the debts listed in\nSOR subparagraphs 1.g and 1.l, nor payments toward the satisfaction of any other SOR\ndebt.\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a\n\n3\nconscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d\nThe administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the\nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision.\nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nUnder this guideline, \u201cfailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts,\nand meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about\nan individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information\u201d (AG\n\u00b6 18). Applicant\u2019s history of financial problems triggers the application of AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a),\n\u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts,\u201d and 19(c), \u201ca history of not meeting financial\nobligations.\u201d\nApplicant satisfied the debt listed in SOR subparagraph 1.k, therefore, I resolve it\nin his favor. The remainder of his delinquencies, however, remain outstanding rendering\nAG \u00b6 20(a), \u201cthe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under\nsuch circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s\ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment,\u201d inapplicable. Although several of\nApplicant\u2019s delinquencies coincide with a lengthy period of unemployment, he did not\nassert that his unemployment contributed to his delinquencies. Also, he produced scant\nevidence of efforts to organize his finances or to repay overdue creditors. Neither AG \u00b6\u00b6\n20(b), \u201cthe conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the\nperson\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, business downturn, unexpected medical\nemergency, or a death, divorce, or separation), and the individual acted responsibly\nunder the circumstances,\u201d 20(c), \u201cthe person has received or is receiving counseling for\nthe problem, and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is\nunder control,\u201d nor AG 20(d), \u201cthe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue\ncreditors or otherwise resolve debts,\u201d apply.\n\n4\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nApplicant\u2019s finances remain delinquent, and he has produced negligible evidence\ndemonstrating that he is resolving them. Also, he did not produce any evidence\naddressing his bout of unemployment, and how it contributed to his financial problems.\nMoreover, it is unclear how Applicant would be able to incorporate an effective debt\nrepayment plan into his budget given the dearth of after-expense income. Upon\nconsidering this case in the context of the whole person concept, I conclude Applicant\nfailed to mitigate the financial considerations security concern. Clearance is denied.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.j:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.k:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraphs 1.l - 1.n:\nAgainst Applicant\n\n5\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.

The action was taken under \nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February \n20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \n(Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President \non December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs \nissued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on July 12, 2009.

Applicant did not file a Response to the FORM within the 30-day time \nallowed that would have expired on September 10, 2009. I received the case \nassignment on October 9, 2009. Based upon a review of the complete case file, \npleadings, and exhibits, eligibility for access to classified information is denied \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant admitted all of the allegations in the SOR.  He explained that his \ndelinquent debts listed in Paragraph 1 were current or paid, and the failure to disclose \nhis financial delinquencies in the SF 86, as alleged in Paragraph 2, was an \u201coversight.\u201d \n \nApplicant is 52 years old and married. He works for a defense contractor. He has \nworked for this employer since June 2008. (Items 2 and 4)  \n \nThe SOR lists eight delinquent debts. These debts total $24,955. The earliest \ndelinquency date is 2003. Applicant\u2019s Answer states his credit card debt of $1,644 is \ncurrent (subparagraph 1.a);his mortgage payment of $1,000 is current (subparagraph \n1.b); his two loan debts to the same creditor of $4,015 and $5,201 are current \n(subparagraphs 1.c and 1.d); his bank debt payment of $48 is paid and the account is \nrepaid (subparagraph 1.e); his bank debt of $5,927 is current (subparagraph 1.f); his \ndebt to a large department store chain of $2,100 is current (subparagraph 1.g); and his \n$5,000 debt on a military credit is current (subparagraph 1.h).

(Items 6-9)  \n \nApplicant was sent two sets of interrogatories asking for further information on \nhis delinquent debts. The March 18, 2009, interrogatories requested information about a \ndebt consolidation loan Applicant stated he obtained six years ago. Applicant did not \ndisclose the requested information about the debts included in the loan or proof that his \npayments were current on that loan. Applicant also failed to provide copies of canceled \nchecks paying these delinquent debts, recent statements from creditors, verification of \nall sources of income, and other items requested in the interrogatories.  Applicant did \nprovide a personal financial statement. This statement showed Applicant has a net \nremainder income monthly of $1,051.16, and owned two late model expensive \nautomobiles. It did not list the individual delinquent debts as set forth in the SOR or their \ncurrent status. The personal financial statement did refer to an attachment concerning a \n\u201cdebt consolidation\u201d debt in the amount of $11,265.52. However, there was no \nattachment to Applicant\u2019s personal financial statement which explained the \u201cdebt \nconsolidation\u201d debt. Applicant has not provided any documents verifying the current \nstatus of his delinquent debts. (Items 6-9)  \n\n \n \n \n \n \n3\n \nApplicant answered the SF 86 Question 28, subsections (a) and (b), with \u201cNo\u201d \nresponses on September 22, 2008. Question 28.a asked Applicant if he had been more \nthan 180 days delinquent on any debt in the past seven years. Question 28.b inquired if \nApplicant currently was delinquent more than 90 days on any debt. Applicant admitted \nthe allegations in subparagraph 2.a of the SOR, but claimed it was a mere \u201coversight\u201d \nthat he did not answer the questions with full disclosure of his delinquent debts. \nApplicant certified at the end of the SF 86 that his answers to all questions, including \nQuestion 28, are \u201ctrue, complete, and correct to the best of\u201d his knowledge. His answers \nwere not true and correct as they pertain to his delinquent debts. (Items 2, 4) \n \nPolicies \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant=s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an applicant=s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, the administrative judge applies the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge=s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG & 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the Awhole-person concept.@ The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG & 2(b) \nrequires that A[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.@ In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nAccording to Directive & E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to \nestablish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive & E3.1.15, an \n\u201capplicant is responsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, \nextenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, \nand has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance \ndecision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \n\n \n \n \n \n \n4\nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be Ain terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.@ See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG & 18:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nThe guideline at AG & 19 contains nine disqualifying conditions that could raise \nsecurity concerns. From these nine conditions, two conditions are applicable to the facts \nfound in this case: \n \n(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and  \n \n(c)  a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \n \nFrom 2003 to the present, Applicant accumulated eight delinquent debts totaling \n$24,955 that are unpaid or unresolved. \n \nThe guideline in AG \u00b6 20 contains six conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. None of the mitigating conditions have any \napplicability because Applicant continuously and deliberately failed to provide any \nrequested documentation except his personal financial statement. That document did \nnot show that he resolved by any means the specific debts set forth in the SOR. He did \nnot meet his burden of proof to show he resolved his delinquent debts. \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n5\nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \n \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern pertaining to Personal Conduct:   \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \nThe following will normally result in an unfavorable clearance action or \nadministrative termination of further processing for clearance eligibility: \n \n(a) refusal, or failure without reasonable cause, to undergo or \ncooperate with security processing, including but not limited to meeting \nwith a security investigator for subject interview, completing security forms \nor releases, and cooperation with medical or psychological evaluation; \nand, \n \n(b) refusal to provide full, frank and truthful answers to lawful \nquestions \nof \ninvestigators, \nsecurity \nofficials, \nor \nother \nofficial \nrepresentatives in connection with a personnel security or trustworthiness \ndetermination. \n \nAG \u00b6 16 describes seven disqualifying conditions under the Personal Conduct \nguideline. One of them could raise a security concern and be disqualifying in this case: \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities.  \n \nApplicant did not disclose his financial delinquencies. Applicant admitted the \nallegations as set forth in subparagraph 2.a of the SOR. Then, in his Answer he claims \nit was a mere oversight on his part when he did not make the requested disclosure.  \nWhen compared to his lack of disclosure in the interrogatories, his explanation is not \npersuasive or believable.  \n \nIn AG \u00b6 17 seven mitigating conditions are listed. After a careful review of the \nfacts, I conclude none of them apply to Applicant\u2019s case. Reviewing those conditions, I \ncompared them to the facts in this case.  I concluded Applicant did not make a prompt \nand good-faith effort to disclose he debts.  His lack of disclosure was not done on the \nadvice of counsel. These omissions are not minor or infrequent. Applicant has not taken \n\n \n \n \n \n \n6\nsteps to reduce vulnerability to coercion, nor obtained counseling to relieve stress or \nchange his behavior on this issue. The information about his delinquent debts is \nsubstantiated. There is no relevance to the mitigating condition about association with \npersons involved in criminal activities. Therefore, none of the seven mitigating \nconditions have any relevance or applicability to Applicant\u2019s case. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant=s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant=s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG & 2(a): \n \n (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual=s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \nUnder AG & 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.      \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant was an adult when he \nincurred the debts. He was an adult when asked to disclose information about the \ndebts. He has not disclosed any persuasive objective documentary evidence to address \neach of the delinquent debts specifically listed in the SOR. He ignored repeated \nrequests in the interrogatories submitted to him to supply such proof. Furthermore, he \nfailed to disclose his delinquent debts in answering Question 28 on the SF 86.  \nApplicant shows a pattern of refusing to disclose his delinquent debts in the SF 86 and \nin his uninformative responses to the two interrogatories sent to him. He seeks a \nsecurity clearance from the government, but will not cooperate and provide requested \ninformation.  \n \nWhat action, if any, Applicant has taken to resolve his delinquent debt is not \nknown from the available evidence. His refusal to answer questions about these matters \nleaves him vulnerable to pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress based on the \nmagnitude of his financial obligations and his desire for secrecy. His lack of action \ncontinues to this day, and is obviously voluntary. His inaction will continue based on his \npast performance. Applicant displayed a lack of good judgment incurring the debts while \npurchasing two expensive late-model cars. Applicant now compounds his predicament \n\n \n \n \n \n \n7\nby willfully refusing to disclose financial information the government needs to make an \ninformed decision on his security clearance request. The burden of proof is on Applicant \nto show why the mitigating conditions under both guidelines should apply to him.  He \nfailed in that effort.  Any doubt is resolved against him and in favor of national security, \nin accordance with the Directive \u00b6 E2.2.2.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and substantial doubts as \nto Applicant=s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant did not mitigate the security concerns arising under the guideline for \nFinancial Considerations. He did not mitigate the security concerns under the guideline \nfor Personal Conduct. I conclude the \u201cwhole- person\u201d concept against Applicant.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n          Subparagraphs 1.a to 1.h:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:   \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

Garcia, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nCURRY, Marc E., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant mitigated the security concern generated by her troubled finances and\nomission of delinquencies from her security clearance application. Clearance is granted.\nOn September 3, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under Guidelines\nF, financial considerations, and E, personal conduct. The action was taken under\nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February\n20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial\nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended\n(Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) effective within the Department\nof Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \nApplicant answered the SOR on October 13, 2009, admitting to SOR\nsubparagraphs 1.a, 1.g, 1.k., 1.m, 1.o, 1.r, 1.w, 1.ee, 1.ff, and 1.hh. She denied the\nremainder, and requested a hearing. The case was assigned to me on November 19,\n2009. On December 9, 2009, a hearing was scheduled for January 5, 2010. During the\nMarch 29, 2010\n\n2\nhearing, which was held as scheduled, I received 12 government exhibits, 14 Applicant\nexhibits,  and the testimony of two witnesses for Applicant. At the close of the hearing, I\nleft the record open at Applicant\u2019s request to allow her to submit additional exhibits.\nWithin the time allotted, she submitted another 11 exhibits, which I incorporated into the\nrecord. The transcript (Tr.) was received on January 12, 2010.\nPreliminary Ruling\nAt the beginning of the hearing, Department Counsel stipulated that Applicant\nsatisfied the accounts set forth in the following SOR subparagraphs: 1.c, 1.e, 1.g, 1.l (as\nduplicated in 1.x), 1.q, 1.v, 1.w, 1.y, 1.z, 1.ff, and 1.dd. Also, Department Counsel\nstipulated that Applicant successfully disputed the accounts set forth in SOR\nsubparagraphs 1.p, 1.s, and 1.u. I resolve all of these SOR allegations for Applicant. \nParagraph 2 of the SOR alleges Applicant falsified her security clearance\napplication by intentionally omitting delinquent debts in response to questions requiring\ntheir disclosure. At the close of the hearing, Department Counsel conceded that\nApplicant\u2019s omissions were unintentional, and that Guideline E no longer posed a\nsecurity concern. Consequently, I resolve Paragraph 2 in Applicant\u2019s favor.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 45-year-old single woman with two sons, ages 24 and 14. Two\nprior marriages ended in divorce (Tr. 25). She is a veteran of the United States Air\nForce where she served from 1983 to her retirement in 2004. She has a high school\neducation and has taken various courses in information management over the years\n(Tr. 25).\nSince 2006, she has worked as an executive assistant for a government agency\ndirector (Tr. 14). Her employer who assigned her to the position is a defense contractor\n(AE A). Applicant\u2019s duties include coordinating plans and preparing the agency director\nfor meetings. According to the program manager who coordinates the placement of\ncontract employees, \u201cshe is responsible for carrying out complex assignments [and]\nexercising independent judgment, initiative, and tact\u201d (Id.). According to her supervisor,\nher \u201cintegrity is of the highest level\u201d (Tr. 15).\nApplicant\u2019s finances were stable through August 2005. Then, in September 2005,\nHurricane Katrina struck the Gulf Coast, destroying her grandmother\u2019s home and\ndisplacing her mother from her home. Within six weeks of the disaster, both relatives\nmoved in with Applicant (Tr. 151) Applicant\u2019s grandmother was a 96-year-old double\namputee with severe health problems requiring intensive, expensive medical care (Tr.\n163). When living at home, Applicant\u2019s grandmother received Medicare to cover these\nexpenses. When she relocated, Applicant\u2019s state did not begin to cover her\ngrandmother\u2019s expenses until approximately three months later (Tr. 163). During this\nthree-month period, Applicant incurred approximately $3,000 of out-of-pocket medical\nexpenses for her grandmother\u2019s care for which she was never reimbursed (Tr. 165).\n\nSee discussion of SOR subparagraph 1.k, infra.\n1\n3\nIn October 2005, approximately a month after Applicant\u2019s relatives moved into\nher home, she fell and broke her ankle (Tr. 152). Although she continued to perform\nconsulting work during this period, she was unable to work for her primary employer,\nand consequently earned substantially less income for approximately two months (Tr.\n152). Applicant gradually began to fall behind on her bills (Tr. 98,155). \nIn December 2005, Applicant\u2019s cousin, another relative displaced by Hurricane\nKatrina, moved in with her (Tr. 154). Applicant\u2019s grandmother died in January 2006, and\nher mother moved from her home in May 2006 (Tr. 154). In late 2006, Applicant\ndiscovered that her cousin had charged thousands of dollars of credit purchases on\ncredit cards opened fraudulently in her name (Tr. 99, 155-156). Shortly after this\nrevelation, Applicant\u2019s cousin moved from her home. However, Applicant\u2019s financial\nstanding continued to deteriorate.\nAt or about the time Applicant began struggling to pay her bills, her job\nincreasingly began requiring extensive overnight travel. Her continuous struggle to\nprovide child care for her youngest son during the overnight travel periods compelled\nher to quit the job in June 2006 (Tr. 158). She was unemployed for the next two months.\nBy March 2009, Applicant had accrued approximately $42,000 of delinquent\ndebt, and had assumed responsibility for one debt for approximately $27,600.  She then\n1\nbegan organizing her finances and addressing her delinquent debt by contacting\ncreditors to either arrange payment plans or dispute them. In October 2009, Applicant\nretained an attorney to assist her with resolving the disputed debts (GE 3 at 78).\nAlthough Applicant periodically received advice through her credit union and several\ncredit consolidation agencies, she did not complete a formal credit counseling course\n(Tr. 171). By May 2009, Applicant had either satisfied or successfully disputed\napproximately $35,000 of the alleged delinquent debt, as identified in the Preliminary\nRuling, above.\nFourteen debts, as set forth in SOR subparagraphs 1.a, 1.b, 1d, 1.f, 1.h, 1.k, 1.j,\n1.m, 1.n, 1r, 1.x, 1.aa, 1.cc, 1.ee, and 1gg, remained at issue after the parties\u2019\nstipulations. They total $45,000. Three other SOR debts (subparagraphs 1.o, 1.t, 1.hh)\nare duplicates totaling approximately $37,000.\nSOR subparagraph 1.a is a dental bill for $422 from August 2004 (Tr. 51).\nApplicant\u2019s dentist originally submitted her a bill for $2.40, which noted that her\ninsurance company would cover the remainder (GE 3 at 10). Later, Applicant\ndiscovered that her insurance company did not pay its expected share (Tr. 54).\nApplicant contested the bill. By July 2009, the dental office had assigned it to a\ncollection agent and the balance had increased to $1,185 (GE 3 at 11). Applicant and\nthe collection agent negotiated a settlement for $969. In October 2009, Applicant began\nsatisfying it (Id.). She satisfied it completely by February 2010 (AE R).\n\n4\nThe creditor listed in SOR subparagraph 1.b is a collection agent for a loan\nallegedly delinquent since 2002 (Tr. 59). Applicant disputes this claim, asserting that\nshe had satisfied it before retiring from the military (Tr. 59). The alleged balance due is\n$2,694. Since April 2009, Applicant has been making monthly payments into an escrow\naccount while the dispute is pending (AE D; Tr. 59, 61). So far, she has paid $726 (Id.). \nSOR subparagraph 1.f, as duplicated in SOR subparagraph 1.t, is a disputed\nphone bill for $871 (Tr. 63). Applicant acknowledges falling behind when she was\nunemployed, but contends she satisfied it (Tr. 64). Her attorney wrote a dispute letter to\nthe creditor on October 2, 2009 (GE 3 at 28). Applicant has another account with the\nsame phone company that is current (Id.).\nSOR subparagraph 1.h is a debt Applicant allegedly owes stemming from a loan\nfor which she applied while in the military (Tr. 69). She contends she satisfied it in 2003\nthrough automatic allotments before retiring (GE 3 at 35). Her attorney notified the\ncollection agent of the dispute on October 13, 2009 (GE 3 at 34). After conducting an\ninvestigation, the collection agent rejected Applicant\u2019s dispute, and concluded that she\nowed $3,888 (AE N). Applicant still disputes the claim and contends that a credit report\nindicates that she satisfied it (AE M at 7). Although AE M indicates she satisfied a loan\nowed to the same creditor, the account numbers are different (cf. AE M at 7 with GE 10\nat 3). \nApplicant paid the creditors listed in SOR subparagraphs 1.i and 1.j, collectively\nin the amount of $1,750, through negotiated settlements (AE T; AE X at 2, respectively).\nThe debt listed in SOR subparagraph 1.k is a student loan her oldest son obtained to\nhelp finance his graduate school education (AE G at 3). Although Applicant did not\ncosign the loan, she assumed it after he defaulted in March 2009 (GE 3 at 48).\nConsistent with the agreement, Applicant now owes approximately $27,600 (AE W at\n9). She has been making $200 monthly payments, as agreed, since March 2009 (GE 3\nat 46) \nThe debt listed in SOR subparagraph 1.m and duplicated in SOR subparagraphs\n1.o and 1.hh is the deficiency owed from a car that was voluntarily repossessed at or\nabout the time Applicant\u2019s relatives were living with her (GE 4 at 12). As of March 2009,\nthe balance was $24,550 (GE 3 at 56). She has been making monthly payments since\nthen (GE 3 at 56-58).\nSOR subparagraph 1.n is a debt for $172 owed to a department store. Applicant\npaid it through a negotiated settlement in March 2009 (AE X). SOR subparagraph 1.r is\na collection agent for a credit card company that is delinquent in the amount of $1,553.\nApplicant disputes this bill contending that her cousin accrued it (Tr. 82). Nevertheless,\nshe has been making monthly payments while the dispute is pending (AE M at 10). As\nof January 2010, the balance was $331 (Id.).\nSOR subparagraph 1.aa is a debt for $450. Applicant settled it for $221 and\nsatisfied it in March 2009 (GE 3 at 102).\n\n5\nApplicant identified the 1993 judgment for $1,898 listed in SOR subparagraph\n1.gg as stemming from a delinquent credit card account that her first husband opened\napproximately 20 years ago (Tr. 131). Applicant denies responsibility for this account\ncontending that her name was not on the account and that her ex-husband satisfied it\nyears ago (Tr. 131). She attempted to locate court records verifying this judgment was\nsatisfied, but was unsuccessful (AE L at 1).\nApplicant maintains a budget. She earns a salary of approximately $81,500 after\ntaxes (AE B) She receives an additional $24,000 through her pension and her child\nsupport (Id.). She has approximately $4,000 in savings, and $4,000 of after-expense\nincome (Id.; Tr. 168). \nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied together with the factors\nlisted in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based\non the evidence contained in the record. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by department counsel. . . .\u201d The\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nUnder Guideline F,  \u201cfailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts,\nand meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about\nan individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information\u201d (AG\n\n6\n\u00b6 18). Moreover, \u201can individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to\nengage in illegal acts to generate funds\u201d (Id.). Applicant\u2019s history of financial problems\ntriggers the application of AG & 19(a), \u201can inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts,@ and\nAG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d \nAs of August 2005, Applicant\u2019s finances were stable. However, within six months,\nthree relatives displaced by Hurricane Katrina moved in with her. One was an invalid\nrequiring costly treatment which Applicant incurred, and another was a thief who stole\nher identity and charged thousands of dollars on credit cards opened in Applicant\u2019s\nname. During part of this time, Applicant was underemployed.\nOne of Applicant\u2019s relatives is deceased and the others no longer live with her.\nFor the past year, Applicant has been confronting her delinquent debts either through\nsatisfying them entirely, making monthly payments, or disputing them with the help of an\nattorney. She maintains a budget and has ample savings and income to continue\nadhering to her payment plans or to satisfy any disputed debt not resolved in her favor.\nAG \u00b6\u00b6 20(b), \u201cthe conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond\nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected\nmedical emergency, or a death, divorce, or separation), and the individual acted\nresponsibly under the circumstances,\u201d 20(c), \u201cthe person has received counseling for\nthe problem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is\nunder control,\u201d and 20(d), \u201cthe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue\ncreditors or otherwise resolve debts,\u201d apply.\nApplicant\u2019s attorney provided comprehensive written notice to all of the creditors\nwhose debts Applicant disputed. Thus far, the creditors have resolved some of the\ndisputes in her favor and others are pending. Applicant resolved one dispute, as listed\nin SOR subparagraph 1.a, by negotiating a settlement, and satisfying it. \nI did not find the evidence supporting Applicant\u2019s dispute of SOR subparagraph\n1.h, a debt for $3,888, to be persuasive because the account number for the account\nshe paid did not match the account number for the debt the creditor alleges is\noutstanding. I conclude her basis for disputing SOR subparagraph 1.h is honest, but\nmistaken. AG \u00b6 20(e), \u201cthe individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of\nthe past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented proof to\nsubstantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions to resolve the\nissue,\u201d does not apply. \nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n\n7\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole person concept. \nOf the $45,000 of delinquent SOR debt remaining after the parties\u2019 stipulations,\nmore than half stemmed from a student loan that Applicant did not accrue. Rather, she\nassumed it after her son defaulted, and has been paying it timely since then. Upon\nconsidering the voluminous evidence that Applicant provided, I conclude her finances\nare clearly under control. The circumstances that led to her financial distress are not\nlikely to recur. Evaluating this case in the context of the whole person concept, I\nconclude Applicant has mitigated the security concerns.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.hh:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline E:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 2.a - 2.d:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.\n                                             \nMARC E. CURRY\nAdministrative Judge\n\n8\n",

Goldstein, Esq., Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro se\nFebruary 11, 2010\n______________\nDECISION\n______________\nROSS, Wilford H., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted his Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing\n(e-QIP) on September 9, 2008 (Government Exhibit 1). On July 27, 2009, the Defense\nOffice of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing\nthe security concerns under Guideline F concerning Applicant. The action was taken\nunder Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry\n(February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense\nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as\namended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the\nPresident on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for\nSORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on August 11, 2009, and requested a\nhearing before an administrative judge. Department Counsel was prepared to proceed\non September 9, 2009. This case was assigned to me on September 16, 2009.  DOHA\nissued a notice of hearing on September 22, 2009, and I convened the hearing as\nscheduled on October 27, 2009. The Government offered Government Exhibits 1\n\n2\nthrough 6, which were received without objection. Applicant testified on his own behalf,\nand submitted Applicant Exhibits A through I, also without objection. Applicant asked\nthat the record remain open for the receipt of additional documents. The Applicant\nsubmitted Applicant Exhibit J on November 23, 2009, and it was admitted without\nobjection. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing on November 4, 2009. The\nrecord closed on November 23, 2009. Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings,\nexhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified information is granted.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is 38 and married. He and his wife have been married 20 years, and\nhave three children. He is employed by a defense contractor and seeks to obtain a\nsecurity clearance in connection with his employment. \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe Government alleges that Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he is\nfinancially overextended and therefore at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to\ngenerate funds. Applicant admits SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a., 1.c., 1.d., and 1.f. Those admissions are\nhereby deemed findings of fact. He denies SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b., and 1.e. \nApplicant testified about his financial situation. Much of it is related to the health\nof the Applicant and his wife. Applicant was a manual labourer when he was younger. In\n1990, he was seriously injured on the job. His injury required surgery, and he was\ninformed that he could not return to manual labour. He went back to school and\nobtained the equivalent of an Associate\u2019s degree in a technical field. Applicant has\nworked his way up in this technical field from 1993 to the present day. (Transcript at 34-\n36.)\nWhen she was a teenager, Applicant\u2019s wife was diagnosed with a serious and\nchronic health condition which affects her ability to work or even lead a normal life. She\nhas had five major surgeries, nine surgeries in total, in connection with her condition.\nShe can only work sporadically. Her health care provider states, \u201cCurrently the patient is\non a regimen of oral medications and infusion therapy for her [condition]. Her disease is\nadvanced and severe and will require chronic lifelong treatment.\u201d (Applicant Exhibit J at\n3, 12-13; Transcript at 33-34, 37-39, 49-56.)\n 1.a.\nApplicant admits that he filed for bankruptcy protection under Chapter 7 of\nthe Bankruptcy Code in 1999. He received a discharge in about February 2000.\nAccording to the Applicant, the family debt situation never recovered from his injury and\ntwo years of unemployment. Eventually, a bankruptcy was the only way they saw to\nresolve the situation. (Transcript at 36-37, 40-41.)\n1.b.\nApplicant denied that he was currently indebted to a cable television\ncompany in the amount of $116. He states, exhibits support, and the Government\n\n3\nagrees, that this debt has been paid. (Government Exhibit 6 at 1; Applicant Exhibit H;\nTranscript at 13, 66-71.)\n1.c.\nApplicant admitted that he owed a debt to an automobile finance company\non a repossessed vehicle. He denies that the amount he owes is $6,876. According to\nApplicant, he owed less than $3,000 on this vehicle when it was repossessed in\napproximately 2006. This was after paying on the automobile for seven years, and four\nmajor engine repairs. After the vehicle was sold for substantially less then that, the\nfinance company informed him that he owed the amount stated in the SOR.\n(Government Exhibit 2 at 3; Transcript at 74-79, 89-91.) In November 2009, Applicant\nwrote the three credit reporting agencies, disputing the amount he owes on this\naccount. (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit J at 9-11.) Applicant also wrote a statement concerning his\nactions after the hearing regarding this debt. This letter states that this finance company\n\u201cis no longer in business and all attempts to contact them were unsuccessful.\u201d Applicant\nexpresses a credible desire to resolve this debt if possible. (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit J at 8.)\n1.d.\nApplicant admitted that he owed a debt to an automobile finance company\non a repossessed vehicle in the amount of $5,938. Applicant owned this car at the same\ntime as the one in 1.c. The family could not afford two automobiles on one income, so\nhe allowed this car to be repossessed in 2001. (Transcript at 79-82.) Applicant wrote a\nstatement concerning his actions with regards to this debt after the hearing. Specfically,\nApplicant has made payment arrangements with the successor in interest to the original\ncreditor. (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit J at 8.)\n1.e.\nApplicant has consistently denied that he is indebted to a collection\nagency in the amount of $35 for a returned check. This was a check to a pharmacy and\nthe Applicant states that it has been paid directly to the hospital. The hospital has\nconfirmed with the Applicant that he does not have any returned check charges\ncurrently owing. (Government Exhibit 2 at 2; Applicant\u2019s Exhibit J at 8; Transcript at 82-\n85.)\n1.f.\nApplicant admits that he was indebted to a collection agency for a\ntelephone bill. Applicant has paid this bill, as shown by a statement from the creditor.\n(Applicant Exhibit I; Transcript at 85-87.)\nApplicant maintains, and records show, that he is able to pay his regular debts.\nApplicant, and his family, budget as they can, and they have been successful in this,\ngiven the Applicant\u2019s wife\u2019s limitations and the responsibility of the family.  (Government\nExhibit 6; Transcript at 57-66.)\nPolicies\nSecurity clearance decisions are not made in a vacuum. When evaluating an\napplicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the administrative judge must consider\nthe revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief introductory explanations for\neach guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and\n\n4\nmitigating conditions, which are to be used as appropriate in evaluating an applicant\u2019s\neligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision. In addition, the administrative judge may also rely on his own\ncommon sense, as well as his knowledge of the law, human nature, and the ways of the\nworld, in making a reasoned decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based\non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Security clearance decisions include, by\nnecessity, consideration of the possible risk that the applicant may deliberately or\ninadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a\ncertain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk\nof compromise of classified information.\n \nFinally, as emphasized in Section 7 of Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny\ndetermination under this order . . . shall be a determination in terms of the national\ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant\nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access\nto classified or sensitive information).  \n\n5\nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set\nout in AG & 18:      \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and\nmeet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment,\nor unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nAG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.\nSimilarly under AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise\nsecurity concerns. Applicant, by his own admission, and supported by the documentary\nevidence, has approximately $12,000 in past-due debts for two automobile\nrepossessions, which have been due and owing for several years. The evidence is\nsufficient to raise these potentially disqualifying conditions.\nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security\nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG \u00b6 20(a), the disqualifying condition\nmay be mitigated where Athe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or\noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt\non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ Applicant=s\nfinancial difficulties arose about six to ten years ago, primarily between 1999-2004. In\naddition, these two repossessions occurred because of the unique situation regarding\nthe health of the Applicant and his wife. He has paid off two of the other past due debts\nalleged in the SOR, stated credibly that he does not owe a third, evinced a credible and\nbelievable intent to pay off his remaining past due indebtedness, and his current\nfinancial situation is stable. This mitigating condition applies to this case. \nAG \u00b6 20(b) states that the disqualifying conditions may be mitigated where \u201cthe\nconditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s\ncontrol (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical\nemergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual acted responsibly\nunder the circumstances.\u201d  As stated above, the Applicant and his wife both have\nsuffered from severe medical conditions. The wife\u2019s situation is severe and chronic.\nDespite that, and with a family of five to support on his salary alone, with the exception\nof the two repossessions, his financial condition is stable. This mitigating condition also\napplies.\nApplicant has initiated a good-faith effort to pay off his creditors. As stated above,\nseveral have been paid, including at least one debt not alleged in the SOR.\n(Government Exhibit 2 at 2, 6.) Accordingly, AG \u00b6 20(d) is applicable.  \n\n6\nApplicant is over $11,000 in debt. However, the record is clear that he is not\nrunning up new debt. Indeed, he is paying his debts as his financial situation allows him\nto do so. Under the particular circumstances of this case, I find that \u201cthere are clear\nindications that the problem is being resolved or is under control,\u201d as required by AG \u00b6\n20(c).\nWhole-Person Concept\nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the relevant circumstances. Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination\nof whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance must be an overall commonsense\njudgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person\nconcept. The administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors\nlisted at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.      \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe relevant facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant had some\nfinancial problems about four to ten years ago, but his current financial condition is\nstable. Under AG \u00b6 2(a)(2), I have considered the facts of the Applicant\u2019s medical\ncondition and that of his wife. Under the particular circumstances of this case, it is clear\nthat they have done the best they can. Her debilitating disease makes the \u201cnormal\u201d two\nincome marriage impossible. Based on the record, I find that there have been\npermanent behavioral changes under AG \u00b6 2(a)(6). Accordingly, at the present time, I\nfind that there is little to no potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress (AG \u00b6\n2(a)(8); and that there is no likelihood of recurrence (AG \u00b6 2(a)(9). \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with no questions or doubts as to\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I\nconclude Applicant has mitigated the security concerns arising from his financial\nsituation.\nOn balance, I conclude that Applicant has successfully overcome the\nGovernment's case opposing his request for a security clearance.  Accordingly, the\nevidence supports granting his request for a security clearance.\n\n7\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a. through 1.f.:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record, it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance.

Applicant is 27 years old, single, and has no children. He graduated from college cum laude with a bachelor\u2019s degree in economics and international affairs in 2005. Since 2005, when he began working for a defense contracting company, he has received training in Department of Defense functional areas and holds a certification in life-cycle logistics.

Accordingly, his request for a security clearance is denied. \n \nApplicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing, \nwhich he signed on July 21, 2005. After reviewing the results of the ensuing background \ninvestigation, adjudicators for the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) \nwere unable to make a preliminary affirmative finding1 that it is clearly consistent with \nthe national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  \n \n \n1 Required by Executive Order 10865, as amended, and by DoD Directive 5220.6 (Directive), as \namended. \nSeptember 20, 2010\n\n \n \n2\n                                                \n \nOn January 14, 2010, DOHA issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) \nthat specified the basis for its finding: security concerns addressed in the Directive \nunder Guideline K (Handling Protected Information), Guideline M (Use of Information \nTechnology Systems), and Guideline E (Personal Conduct) of the Adjudicative \nGuidelines (AG).2 Applicant signed his notarized Answer on February 4, 2010. He \ndenied all allegations in the SOR. He also requested a hearing before an administrative \njudge. Department Counsel was prepared to proceed on March 24, 2010, and the case \nwas assigned to me on March 29, 2010. DOHA issued a Notice of Hearing on April 14, \n2010, and I convened the hearing as scheduled on May 19, 2010. \n \nDuring the hearing, the Government offered five exhibits, which were admitted as \nGovernment Exhibits (GE) 1, 2, 4, and 5, without objection.3 I admitted GE 3 over \nApplicant\u2019s objection to two pages. Applicant testified, presented the testimony of two \nwitnesses, and offered 31 exhibits, admitted as Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AE) A through EE. \nDOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on May 28, 2010. \n \nProcedural Issues \n \nOn April 13, 2010, Applicant requested to have witnesses testify by telephone. \nDepartment Counsel did not object to the telephone testimony. I held a telephone \nconference call with both parties on April 14, 2010, and granted Applicant\u2019s request.4  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nAfter a thorough review of the pleadings, the testimony, and the record evidence, \nI make the following additional findings of fact. \n \nApplicant is 27 years old, single, and has no children.

(GE 1; AE K \u2013 Q, R - U; Tr. 64-80, 136, 140-\n141, 155) \n \n \nAccording to Company B\u2019s FSO, Applicant \u201creceived necessary security training \nin October 2006\u201d when he joined Company B. On October 16, 2006, Applicant read \nand signed four documents titled, \u201cGeneral Security Briefing,\u201d5 \u201cReporting of Adverse \nInformation,\u201d \u201cCounterintelligence Briefing,\u201d and \u201cForeign Travel Defensive Security \nBriefing.\u201d The General Security Briefing6 ended with the following statement above the \nsignature line: \u201cBy signing this form I acknowledge my security responsibilities as \nexplained to me and agree to observe security rules and regulations involved.\u201d At the \nhearing, he testified that he did not receive a briefing about security, the National \nIndustrial Security Program Operating Manual (NISPOM),7 Company B\u2019s Standard \nPractices and Procedures (SPP) for security, or about the information in the documents \nhe signed. He did not receive a copy of the documents. (GE 3; Tr. 82-83, 85-87, 230) \n \n \nWhile employed by Company B, Applicant was transferred from his original job \nat Site C to Site A, where the testing and evaluation (T&E) of military equipment was \nconducted. He provided daily reports on the T&E, and acted as liaison to the project\u2019s \nprogram management office, which was located at Site C. His military supervisor for \nthe T&E project was Major A, a Marine Corps officer, whose office was at Site C. \nApplicant provided daily reports to Major A about each day\u2019s testing. His reports were \nnot classified; however, test results, images, and videos of the testing were classified. \n(Tr. 81, 89) \n \n \nOn August 8, 2007,8 Major A told Applicant he wished to see several compact \ndisks (CDs) showing testing of the equipment. He told Applicant to obtain these secret-\n \n5 The two-page General Security Briefing contained in GE 3 is partially illegible. Upon request for a more \nlegible copy, Department Counsel provided to Applicant's counsel and to me her own transcribed \naccount of the two pages. I have not used this account, as it was prepared by one of the parties. In \nreferring to this document, I rely only on those sections that are legible, or that were read into the record \nand agreed to by Applicant during the hearing.  \n \n6 The General Security Briefing contained the following relevant sections: Section 9, which prohibits \nreproduction of classified material without the prior consent of the FSO and without entering the \nreproduction into accountability records; Section 16, which prohibits holding classified materials \novernight, without special provisions; and Section 19, which requires immediate reporting to Security of \nthe following, inter alia, \"Loss, compromise or suspected compromise of classified material by yourself or \nany other employee or subcontractor employee.\u201d (GE 3) \n \n7 See Department of Defense Manual 5220.22-M, National Industrial Security Program Operating \nManual (NISPOM). (February 28, 2006) \n \n8 The record is contradictory as to when Applicant brought the CDs to Major A. Applicant testified that he \nprovided the CDs to Major A in August 2007. However, emails among the involved civilians and military \nmembers indicate Applicant gave the classified CDs to Major A in June 2007. (AE G; Tr. 94) \n \n\n \n \n4\n                                                \nlevel CDs from Mr. B, who was in charge of the ballistics program at Site A. Major A \nalso told Applicant to put the CDs in the safe9 in Applicant's office, and later, he would \nlet Applicant know when he should take them to the Major\u2019s office. Mr. B told Applicant \nthat he would not release the classified CDs until Applicant had a courier card \nauthorizing him to transport them, and Applicant should contact his FSO about the \ncourier card. Applicant\u2019s FSO informed him that he did not need a courier card to \ntransport classified information from one cleared facility to another cleared facility.10 \nHowever, she faxed a courier card to Applicant. Once Applicant had the courier card, \nMr. B. had Applicant sign a form, which Applicant thinks was a release or receipt \nindicating that the material was being released to him. Mr. B. kept the form. He then \nhanded Applicant a locked, zippered pouch that held a plastic container with \napproximately 20 CDs. The container was marked Secret, but Applicant does not \nremember if the individual CDs were marked. Each CD contained three videos and \napproximately 20 images. Each video began and ended with a Secret marking. \nApplicant returned to his office, placed the pouch in the safe, and called Major A to let \nhim know he had the CDs. Major A then told Applicant to bring the CDs to the Major\u2019s \nhome at Site B, instead of to his office. He also told Applicant not to tell anyone about \nbringing the CDs from Site A to Site B. Applicant drove to Major A\u2019s home with the CDs \nin the locked pouch. (GE 2, 3; AE H; Tr. 94-101; 163-166, 174, 260) \n \n \nAfter receiving the pouch, Major A told Applicant that he needed the CDs in \norder to prepare a briefing about the equipment testing. In his statement to the NCIS \ninvestigator, Applicant stated, \u201c[Major A] informed me he was burning copies of the \nCDs.\u201d Applicant said, \u201cI remember [Major A] continually told me to keep quiet about the \nCDs and what we were doing was technically wrong.\u201d Applicant's understanding was \nthat, \u201cHe [Major A] didn\u2019t want a lot of folks to know about it.\u201d He testified that the Major \nindicated it was bringing the CDs to his home that was \u201ctechnically wrong.\u201d Applicant \ntestified that he did not pursue this remark for several reasons: he never questioned \nthe Major; the Major was an expert who had written the security classification guide for \nthe program; Applicant respected and admired him; and he did not think Major A was \ndoing anything wrong. Applicant did not report his own actions, the Major\u2019s actions, or \nMajor A\u2019s comments to any authority. He testified, \u201cI didn\u2019t understand what he meant \nand I didn\u2019t ask questions. I wasn\u2019t in the position to ask him what he meant. I did not \nhave a relationship like that with him. It was \u2013 I was very intimidated by him as well. He \nwas very powerful. He was very \u2013 you know, I just didn\u2019t really talk to him.\u201d As to why \n \n9 During his NCIS interview, Applicant described this safe as a \u201cfile cabinet.\u201d His signed statement says \nhe told the investigator it was not a classified container. However, Applicant denies that he said that, and \nstates that the investigator inserted that comment. Applicant testified that he signed it despite the \ninaccuracy because he was under a lot of stress and overlooked it. The container where Applicant \nstored the CDs is the only one in that office. On December 18, 2007, the Company B FSO verified that \nthe cabinet in Applicant's office was \u201can approved GSA safe there physically in the office, with an X09 \nlock and that the level of that safe was SECRET.\u201d (GE 2; AE EE; Tr. 224-225) \n \n10 Applicant testified that he believes his FSO thought that he was bringing the CDs to Major A at his \noffice in a cleared facility. At that point in time, Major A had not yet requested Applicant to bring them to \nhis home.(Tr. 258-259) \n\n \n \n5\nhe brought the classified CDs to the Major\u2019s house, he testified, \u201cI was following \norders.\u201d (GE 2; Tr. 102-105, 174, 176, 181-183, 205, 207-208, 234-235, 238) \n \n \nApplicant saw Major A open the pouch, remove the CDs, put them into his \ncomputer, and start downloading the contents. Applicant did not see any markings on \nthe computer indicating it was cleared for use with classified material. Before Applicant \nleft, the Major said he would call him the next day to let him know when to pick up the \nCDs. Applicant did not receive a receipt for the CDs. Major A called Applicant the \nfollowing afternoon, and Applicant drove back to the Major\u2019s house and retrieved the \nCDs. There is no evidence that Applicant obtained a receipt from Major A when he \nretrieved the CDs. Applicant told Major A that he planned to put the CDs in the safe in \nhis office at Site A. He drove directly to his office after leaving Major A\u2019s home. (Tr. \n102-105, 174, 181, 187) \n \n \nWhen Applicant arrived at his office at Site A, he did not store the CDs in the \nsafe immediately. He used his unclassified computer to view the videos and images on \neight of the CDs, and he downloaded the data onto his work computer. He testified that \nhe thought if the Major had put the data on his computer, then Applicant could do the \nsame. He believed that since he held a security clearance, he was entitled to view \nthem. He also testified that he thought he was allowed to place the secret data on his \ncomputer because it was password protected, and no one else had access to it. He \nwanted to have the testing images because he was too busy to be able to view the \ntesting himself, and having the images would allow him to answer customer questions \nabout the testing. In addition, one of his assignments was to train two Chief Warrant \nOfficers (CWOs) about his job, and he thought it would be helpful if he had the data on \nhis computer during the training. Applicant testified that he always brought his work \ncomputer home with him because he worked long hours, and he continued his email \ncorrespondence after work hours. Applicant returned the CDs to Mr. B two days later. \nApplicant testified that, before he couriered the secret CDs, he had never handled \nclassified material or been informed about classified computers. (Tr. 105-110, 194, \n197-204, 220) \n \nIn September 2007, Applicant was transferred to State A to train the CWO who \nwould be taking over his job. Applicant was still reporting to Major A, and still preparing \ndaily test reports. The company had no knowledge of these events, and in October, \nApplicant received laudatory emails from his company supervisor and a vice-president, \ncongratulating Applicant because Major A was very satisfied with his performance. On \nNovember 29, 2007, Applicant was training one of the CWOs, who was the lead on the \nproject. When the CWO saw the classified video, he told Applicant that it was \nprohibited to have this classified data on an unclassified company computer. Applicant \ntestified that he was surprised and upset. The CWO told Applicant not to delete the \nimages, but to be sure they were protected. Mr. C, a civilian contractor who also \nworked on the project and saw the images, told Applicant he should delete them. \nHowever, Applicant decided to follow the instructions of the CWO, and he knew the \ndata was password protected, so he did not delete them. He testified, \u201cI listened to the \n\n \n \n6\n                                                \nuniformed chief warrant officer who was now the lead.\u201d Applicant brought his computer \nto his apartment in State A, because there had been thefts in the area where he was \nworking. He did not contact his FSO after he was informed that he had committed a \nsecurity violation. There is no record evidence that he stored the computer in an \napproved safe while he worked in State A. (GE 2; AE A, B; Tr. 110-117, 214-215, 219-\n220) \n \nIn early December 2007, Applicant informed his FSO that he would be out of the \ncountry from December 3 to December 14. He testified that at least part of his \nawareness that he was required to contact his FSO about foreign travel came from the \nGeneral Security Briefing he received on his first day at Company B. He went on \nvacation to Asia with his parents. On December 6, Major A emailed Applicant asking \nhim to call. However, Applicant did not have email access during his trip abroad. Also \non December 6, Major A informed Applicant's manager and FSO at Company B that \nApplicant had committed a security violation by having classified images on his work \ncomputer. Between December 6 and December 12, Company B\u2019s FSO and senior-\nlevel personnel, pertinent military members, the Defense Security Service, and Naval \nCriminal Investigative Service (NCIS) personnel were notified of Applicant's security \nviolation. (AE C-G; Tr. 111-116, 118, 248, 257-258)  \n \n \nWhen Applicant returned to work in State A on December 14, 2007 after his \nvacation, his supervisor told him that there had been potential security violations \nrelated to (1) Major A\u2019s use of the classified CDs; and (2) Applicant's downloading of \nclassified images onto his work computer. The case was referred to NCIS for \ninvestigation. Applicant's apartment in State A was searched for classified data. On \nDecember 14, his computer and thumb drive were confiscated and provided to NCIS. \nApplicant gave a statement to an NCIS investigator on December 17, 2007. He then \nflew back to his home state and met with his manager, a human resources \nrepresentative, a vice president, and the FSO. On December 18, Applicant gave a \nstatement to the FSO. He was removed from the T&E project, prohibited from having \ncontact with Major A, and was required to report any attempted contact by Major A. On \nDecember 19, 2007, Applicant forwarded to his FSO an email he received from Major \nA. (GE 2; AE H, I; Tr. 119-130) \n \n \nIn January 2008, Applicant returned to his original worksite and to his previous \nassignment of logistics analysis. The FSO gave him security briefings on how to handle \nand store classified data, and related material to read.11 The FSO reported in the \nsecurity database that, \u201cDue to the circumstances and amount of time the information \nhas been out there, it is felt that a compromise cannot be precluded.\u201d Company B \n \n11 GE 3, the NCIS report of investigative action, contains two pages related to guidance for couriers of \nclassified material. Although the pages are not signed as received by Applicant, the date on the NCIS \ncover sheet indicates that Applicant received the courier briefing on December 17, 2007, which is after \nApplicant had couriered the classified information to Major A. Applicant testified that he received this \ninformation on courier requirements in January 2008. Whether he received the courier instructions in \nDecember 2007 or January 2008, I find that he did not receive the courier guidelines until after he had \ncouriered the classified information in August 2007. (GE 3; Tr. 21-22, 87-88) \n\n \n \n7\n                                                \nsuspended Applicant for five days, and confiscated his badges and Common Access \nCard. Applicant does not believe that he was suspended, but only that he was told not \nto report to work for a week and to use his leave hours. Applicant's security clearance \nwas suspended for six months. It was reinstated on July 28, 2008. In his August 2008 \nperformance evaluation, Applicant was rated as \u201cMeets Expectations\u201d for two job \nobjectives and \u201cBelow Expectation\u201d in the third objective, Classified Data. The \nevaluation noted his \u201cself-admitted mishandling of, unauthorized couriering and \ndisclosure of classified (Secret) [program name] test-related files\u2026.\u201d In November \n2008, before leaving Company B, Applicant received a Certificate of Appreciation from \nhis Department of Defense customer for his work. (GE 3, 4; AE J, V, W; Tr. 130-133, \n165, 235-236) \n \n \nThe program manager for the Company B T&E team, who knew Applicant in \n2008, describes him as task-oriented, ambitious, and mature for his age. Applicant\u2019s \n2009 performance evaluation from his current employer notes that he is an outstanding \nasset to the customer, and he \u201cmeets and may exceed some goals.\u201d One of his \ncustomers, who has known him for one year, found him to be motivated, hard-working, \nand of good character. A friend-coworker describes him as being conscientious and \nhaving sound judgment. Another close friend-coworker opined that Applicant has \nintegrity and reliability. Applicant's friend of nine years believes that it is not in \nApplicant's nature to violate rules and regulations. His current supervisor, who testified \non his behalf, recommends Applicant as honest, trustworthy, and without guile, and \nsomeone who displays good judgment. Company B\u2019s FSO testified that Applicant did \nan excellent job as temporary FSO while the FSO was on medical leave. He considers \nApplicant to be honest, reliable, and responsible. (AE AA, X, Y, Z, BB, CC, DD; Tr. \n157-158) \n \nPolicies \n \n \nEach security clearance decision must be a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndetermination based on examination of all available relevant and material information, \nand consideration of the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in the revised AG.12 \nDecisions must also reflect consideration of the \u201cwhole-person\u201d factors listed in \u00b6 2(a) of \nthe Guidelines. \n \n \nThe presence or absence of disqualifying or mitigating conditions does not \ndetermine a conclusion for or against an applicant. However, specific applicable \nguidelines are followed whenever a case can be measured against them, as they \nrepresent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to classified \ninformation.  \n \n \n \n12 Directive. 6.3. \n\n \n \n8\n                                                \n \nA security clearance decision is intended only to resolve the question of whether \nit is clearly consistent with the national interest13 for an applicant to receive or continue \nto have access to classified information. The Government bears the initial burden of \nproducing admissible information on which it based the preliminary decision to deny or \nrevoke a security clearance. Additionally, the Government must be able to prove \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. If the Government meets its burden, it falls to \napplicants to refute, extenuate or mitigate the Government\u2019s case. Because no one has \na \u201cright\u201d to a security clearance, applicants bear a heavy burden of persuasion.14 A \nperson who has access to classified information enters a fiduciary relationship based on \ntrust and confidence. The Government has a compelling interest in ensuring that an \napplicant possesses the requisite judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness to protect the \nnational interest as his or her own. The \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d \nstandard compels resolution of any reasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for \naccess to classified information in favor of the Government.15 \n \nAnalysis \n \n \nGuideline K, Handling Protected Information \n \nAG \u00b6 33 expresses the security concern pertaining to handling protected \ninformation: \n \nDeliberate or negligent failure to comply with rules and regulations for \nprotecting classified or other sensitive information raises doubt about an \nindividual's trustworthiness, judgment, reliability, or willingness and ability \nto safeguard such information, and is a serious security concern. \n \nThe following disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 34 are relevant to the facts of the \ncase and raise a security concern: \n \n(b) collecting or storing classified or other protected information at home or \nin any other unauthorized location;  \n \n(c) loading, drafting, editing, modifying, storing, transmitting, or otherwise \nhandling classified reports, data, or other information on any unapproved \nequipment including but not limited to any typewriter, word processor, or \n \n13 See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988). \n14 See Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, 531. \n15 See Egan; Revised Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 2(b).  \n \n\n \n \n9\ncomputer hardware, software, drive, system, gameboard, handheld, \n\"palm\" or pocket device or other adjunct equipment; \n \n(g) any failure to comply with rules for the protection of classified or other \nsensitive information; and \n \n(i) failure to comply with rules or regulations that results in damage to the \nNational Security, regardless of whether it was deliberate or negligent. \n \n \nIn August 2007, Applicant violated security rules by carrying classified CDs to \nthe home of his supervisor, Major A. Applicant claims that he did not know this was a \nviolation because he did not receive the courier guidelines until after he had couriered \nthe CDs. In addition, the FSO did not alert Applicant to a security issue because she \nthought he was taking the CDs to the Major\u2019s office, i.e., that Applicant was carrying \nthem from one cleared facility to another cleared facility. Applicant may not have \nrealized at first that his couriering was a violation, although the Major\u2019s instructions not \nto tell anyone about it should have raised a flag.  \n \n \nHowever, after Applicant handed over the CDs, the Major explicitly told him that \nbringing the CDs to his house was wrong. At that point, Applicant knew or should have \nknown that his couriering to a personal residence was a security violation. Despite this \nknowledge, he left the CDs at Major A\u2019s home. He did not determine if there was a safe \nto store the material; he did not obtain a receipt. He reported neither Major A\u2019s conduct \nnor his own to his FSO, as required by item 19 of the General Security Briefing that he \nsigned. As cited in SOR allegation 1.c., his actions also violated the following NISPOM \nsections: \n \n5-100. General. Contractors shall be responsible for safeguarding \nclassified information in their custody or under their control. Individuals \nare responsible for safeguarding classified information entrusted to \nthem. The extent of protection afforded classified information shall be \nsufficient to reasonably foreclose the possibility of its loss or \ncompromise. \n \n5-401. Preparation and Receipting  \na.

The inner cover shall be a \nsealed wrapper or envelope plainly marked with the assigned \nclassification and addresses of both sender and addressee. The outer \ncover shall be sealed and addressed with no identification of the \nclassification of its contents. A receipt shall be attached to or enclosed in \nthe inner cover, except that CONFIDENTIAL information shall require a \nreceipt only if the sender deems it necessary. The receipt shall identify \nthe sender, the addressee and the document, but shall contain no \n\n \n \n10\nclassified information. It shall be signed by the recipient and returned to \nthe sender. \n \n5-410. Use of Couriers, Handcarriers, and Escorts.

SECRET Storage. SECRET material shall be stored in a GSA-\napproved security container, an approved vault, or closed area.  \n \n \nApplicant subsequently downloaded classified information from the CDs onto his \nwork computer, which was not approved for classified information. The data was stored \non his computer for four months, until December 14, 2007. During that period, at times \nhe brought his work computer home at night. At those times, his computer was not \nsecure. He then traveled with the computer from his home state to his temporary duty \nin State A. He kept the computer at his worksite in State A. He also brought it to his \napartment in State A after work hours. Nothing in the record indicates that Applicant \nfollowed security rules to protect the classified information on his computer during this \nextended period. The data was vulnerable to disclosure numerous times between \nAugust and December, until it was confiscated in December 2007. AG \u00b6 34(b) and (c) \napply. His actions also violated these NISPOM sections cited in SOR allegation 1.b.:  \n \n \n5-100 (supra) \n \n8-100. General  \na. Information systems (IS) that are used to capture, create, store, process \nor distribute classified information must be properly managed to protect \nagainst unauthorized disclosure of classified information, loss of data \nintegrity to ensure the availability of the data and system.  \nb. Protection requires a balanced approach including IS security features \nto include but not limited to, administrative, operational, physical, \ncomputer, communications, and personnel controls. Protective measures \ncommensurate with the classification of the information, the threat, and the \noperational requirements associated with the environment of the IS are \nrequired.  \nc. The requirements outlined in the following sections apply to all \ninformation \nsystems \nprocessing \nclassified \ninformation. \nAdditional \nrequirements for high-risk systems and data are covered in the NISPOM \nSupplement. \n \n\n \n \n11\n                                                \n8-105.

All users shall:  \n(1) Comply with the IS Security Program requirements.  \n(2) Be aware of and knowledgeable about their responsibilities in regard to \nIS security.  \n(3) Be accountable for their actions on an IS.  \n(4) Ensure that any authentication mechanisms (including passwords) \nissued for the control of their access to an IS are not shared and are \nprotected at the highest classification level and most restrictive \nclassification category of information to which they permit access.  \n(5) Acknowledge, in writing, their responsibilities for the protection of the \nIS and classified information. \n \n \nWhile the CDs were in Applicant's custody in his home state, he stored them in \na container in his office at Site A. In his statement to the NCIS investigator, he said the \ncontainer was a file cabinet that was not approved for storage of classified data. \nHowever, the FSO subsequently verified that the sole container in Applicant's office, \nwhich Applicant thought was not approved, was in fact a GSA-approved safe with an \nX09 lock that was aprroved to store secret data. Applicant\u2019s actions, as cited in SOR \nallegation 1.a., did not violate section 5-100 (supra) or 5-303 (supra), because in \nAugust 2007, in his office, he stored the secret data in an approved safe.16 \n \n \nApplicant admits his security violations, but claims that his employer did not train \nhim in the handling of classified information. However, Applicant testified that he read \nand signed the General Security Briefing provided by his employer. The briefing \nincluded the requirements and prohibitions surrounding the handling of classified \ninformation. By signing the General Security Briefing in October 2006, Applicant \nacknowledged his security responsibilities, and was on notice that classified \ninformation was subject to those rules to prevent its disclosure. Applicant failed to \nfollow these requirements. AG \u00b6 34(g) applies.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 34(i) relates to damage to the national security as a result of failure to \nfollow rules. The record does not contain sufficient evidence to show such damage. \nThe FSO indicated only that compromise of the information could not be ruled out, \ngiven the extensive amount of time that Applicant failed to protect the classified \ninformation. AG 34(i) does not apply. \n \n \n16 There is no record evidence that Applicant kept his computer in an approved safe while he was at his \nwork site in State A. Moreover, he testified that he usually took his computer to his apartment in State A \nafter work. During those times, it was not secured in a safe. Applicant violated NISPOM sections 5-100 \nand 5-303 while in State A from September to December 2007. However, failure to store the data in a \nsecure container during that period was not alleged in the SOR. \n\n \n \n12\n \nAG \u00b6 35 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns, including the \nfollowing relevant conditions: \n \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the behavior, or it has happened so \ninfrequently or under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to \nrecur and does not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the individual responded favorably to counseling or remedial security \ntraining and now demonstrates a positive attitude toward the discharge of \nsecurity responsibilities; and, \n \n(c) the security violations were due to improper or inadequate training. \n \n \nApplicant's actions did not occur under unusual circumstances, but rather in the \nregular course of his duties. He committed an ongoing security violation that began in \nAugust and continued until December 2007. Although the events occurred three years \nago, the extent of the violation outweighs any claim that they are not recent. Each CD \ncontained three videos and about 20 images. He downloaded eight CDs to his work \ncomputer, which resulted in storing 24 classified videos and approximately 160 images \non his unclassified computer. This large volume of critical information regarding testing \nand evaluation of military equipment remained at risk until Applicant's computer was \nconfiscated. His actions reflect poorly on his reliability and judgment, and AG \u00b6 35(a) \ndoes not apply.  \n \n \nApplicant received security training at the Defense Security Service Academy, \nand functioned as the FSO while his current company\u2019s FSO was on sick leave. As a \nresult, he has greater knowledge of security regulations than he did in 2007. In \naddition, the record shows that Applicant's company should have been more diligent in \nensuring that Applicant had sufficient security training. While Applicant receives some \nmitigation under AG \u00b6 35(b) and (c), it must be viewed in light of the scale of \nApplicant's conduct: He ignored the Major\u2019s plain statement that their actions were \nwrong; he downloaded classified information to an unauthorized computer; he left \nclassified information unprotected for an extended period; and even after being told by \nthe CWO and contractor that he had committed a security violation, he failed to inform \nhis FSO or any other authority. The mitigation available under AG \u00b6 35(b) and (c) does \nnot outweigh the significance of Applicant's actions. \n \nGuideline M, Use of Information Technology Systems \n \n \nAG \u00b6 39 expresses the security concern related to use of information technology \nsystems:  \n \nNoncompliance with rules, procedures, guidelines or regulations \npertaining to information technology systems may raise security concerns \n\n \n \n13\nabout an individual's reliability and trustworthiness, calling into question \nthe willingness or ability to properly protect sensitive systems, networks, \nand information. Information Technology Systems include all related \ncomputer hardware, software, firmware, and data used for the \ncommunication, transmission, processing, manipulation, storage, or \nprotection of information. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 40 describes disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern, \nincluding the following relevant conditions:  \n \n(d) downloading, storing, or transmitting classified information on or to \nany unauthorized software, hardware, or information technology system; \nand \n \n(f) introduction, removal, or duplication of hardware, firmware, software, \nor media to or from any information technology system without \nauthorization, when prohibited by rules, procedures, guidelines or \nregulations. \n \nAs discussed supra, Applicant inserted CDs with secret data into his work computer, \nwhich was not approved to store classified data. He then downloaded approximately 24 \nvideos and 160 images of the testing of military equipment, and failed to properly \nprotect it over an extended period. AG \u00b6 40(d) and (f) apply. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 41 provides the following relevant mitigating conditions: \n \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment; and  \n \n(c) the conduct was unintentional or inadvertent and was followed by a \nprompt, good-faith effort to correct the situation and by notification of a \nsupervisor. \n \nApplicant's actions occurred during his routine work, not in unusual circumstances. \nMoreover, his conduct was not minor, as his actions placed secret defense-related \ninformation at risk. Although this conduct occurred several years ago, the importance \nof the data that was put at risk, and the length of time that passed before it was \nremedied, outweighs the distance in time. AG \u00b6 41(a) does not apply.  \n \n \nApplicant downloaded the classified information after seeing Major A do it. Even \nif, arguendo, Applicant did not intend to violate security rules when he copied the CDs \nat his work site, his behavior after he transferred to State A shows that he was not \nacting in good faith. In State A, the CWO and Mr. C alerted him to the fact that he was \n\n \n \n14\ncommitting a security violation by having the classified data on his unclassified \ncomputer. But Applicant did not contact his FSO, or seek out an approved container in \nwhich to store the computer, or determine some appropriate way to protect the \ninformation. Instead, he brought the computer to his apartment in the evenings, where \nit was unprotected. Within days, he departed for a trip to Asia, leaving the computer in \nhis apartment where it remained unprotected for an additional two weeks. AG \u00b6 41(c) \ndoes not apply. \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \n \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern pertaining to personal conduct: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information\u2026. \n \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern, including the \nfollowing relevant condition: \n \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply \nwith rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the \nperson may not properly safeguard protected information. This includes \nbut is not limited to consideration of: (1) untrustworthy or unreliable \nbehavior\u2026  \n \nApplicant failed to follow security requirements that he knew or should have known \nafter reading and signing the security briefing. His violations included transporting \nsecret data to a private home; downloading that data onto an unclassified computer; \nand failing to store his computer containing classified data in an approved container \nwhen he was in State A. Even if, as he contends, he did not know these were \nviolations, once the CWO pointed it out, Applicant still decided not to inform his FSO of \nhis violations, still kept his computer with classified information in his apartment, and \nleft for an overseas trip with the computer still unprotected. Applicant's conduct was \nhighly untrustworthy, shows poor judgment, and demonstrates a willingness to ignore \nrules. AG \u00b6 16(d) applies. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns under \nPersonal Conduct guideline. The following conditions are relevant: \n \n\n \n \n15\n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior \nis so infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it \nis unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained \ncounseling to change the behavior or taken other positive steps to \nalleviate \nthe \nstressors, \ncircumstances, \nor \nfactors \nthat \ncaused \nuntrustworthy, unreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such \nbehavior is unlikely to recur. \n \nApplicant is now aware that he failed to follow important security regulations. He has \ntaken security courses. He is qualified as an FSO and performed well when he acted \nas FSO on a temporary basis for his current employer. AG \u00b6 17(d) applies. However, \nApplicant's violations of the security rules and regulations were frequent, as they \nextended over a period of four months. In addition, his violations were of the most \nserious type, as they involved exposing secret data to disclosure. Applicant failed to \nnotify security officials of the possible compromise, and his own and the Major\u2019s \nviolations, in August 2007. He again decided not to inform his FSO in November 2007, \nafter he was specifically told he was in violation. AG \u00b6 41(a) does not apply. The \nmagnitude of Applicant's violations raises serious doubts about his reliability and \njudgment and outweighs the mitigation under AG \u00b6 17(d).  \n \nWhole-Person Analysis   \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s security eligibility by considering the totality of an applicant\u2019s conduct and all \nthe relevant circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nAG \u00b6 2(c) requires that the ultimate determination of whether to grant a security \nclearance be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of \nthe guidelines and the whole-person concept. Under the cited guidelines, I considered \nthe potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case.  \n \n\n \n \n16\n \nIt is not credible that Applicant was unaware that his actions violated security \nrules. He is an intelligent and well-educated young man. Having read the security brief, \nand heard the Major\u2019s instruction not to tell anyone and his plain statement that what \nthey were doing was wrong, Applicant knew or should have known that he had to, at \nthe least, contact his FSO for guidance. He testified that he did not think the man who \nwrote the security protocols could be breaking the rules. But that man specifically \nstated to Applicant that they were breaking the rules, and certainly, the man who wrote \nthe security protocols would be the one who would know they were breaking the rules.  \n \n \nCompany B shares some responsibility: it should have been more thorough in \nproviding security information to Applicant when he joined the company, and it should \nhave presented the courier briefing to him before he transported classified material, not \nafter. But Applicant had responsibilities as well. Once he read and signed the security \nbrief, he was responsible for following the requirements. His signature is a valid and \nbinding acknowledgment that he read the security requirements. To rule otherwise \nwould render meaningless the certifications and acknowledgments that applicants sign. \n \n \nEven if Applicant's actions in his home state were excused based on ignorance, \nhe could not be excused for his conduct in State A. The CWO and Mr. C told him he \nhad broken security rules by placing classified data on an unauthorized computer. Yet, \nwith this knowledge that he had committed a serious security violation, and that \nclassified information was at risk, he committed an additional violation by failing to \ninform his FSO of a possible compromise. Nor did he notify his supervisor or any \nauthorized person. Although he knew that the classified CDs had to be stored in the \nlocked safe at his office in his home state, he did not seek out an approved container in \nState A to store his computer, and he took his computer to his apartment during non-\nworking hours. Finally, he left the computer in his apartment while he traveled overseas \nfor two weeks.  \n \n \nApplicant's youth and inexperience at the time of these events explain his \nconduct to some extent, especially his failure to report Major A, a powerful person \nwhom Applicant did not feel comfortable challenging. But this failure shows a serious \nlack of judgment. The Government must be able to rely on those who hold security \nclearances to place the Government\u2019s interests above their own. In addition, \nApplicant's failure to inform the FSO, once he was told he was in violation, was a \nconscious decision to violate security regulations. His actions not only raise questions \nas to his trustworthiness, but are particularly troubling because they violate the \nregulations on which the industrial security system is based.  \n \n \nOverall, the record evidence fails to satisfy the doubts raised about Applicant\u2019s \nsuitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant has not \nmitigated the security concerns arising from the cited adjudicative guidelines. \n \n \n \n\n \n \n17\nFormal Findings \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline K  \n \nAGAINST Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a.  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b. \u2013 1.c.:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E  \n \nAGAINST Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a.  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nParagraph 3, Guideline M  \n \nAGAINST Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 3.a.  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to allow Applicant access to \nclassified information.

His eligibility for a security \nclearance is denied. \n \nApplicant completed and signed a security clearance application (SF-86) on \nSeptember 18, 2001. On December 14, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals (DOHA) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR), detailing security \nconcerns under Guideline K, Handling Protected Information, Guideline E, Personal \nConduct, and Guideline M, Use of Information Technology Systems. The action was \ntaken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \n(February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) effective within the \nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \nJuly 29, 2010\n\n \n2 \n \n \n \nOn December 22, 2009, Applicant answered the SOR in writing. He elected to \nhave a hearing before an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on March \n29, 2010, and a notice of hearing was issued on March 31, 2010, setting Applicant\u2019s \nhearing for May 3, 2010. I convened the hearing, as scheduled, to consider whether it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for \nApplicant. \n \nThe Government called no witnesses and introduced seven documents. Six of \nthe documents were marked Ex. 1 through 6 and admitted to the record without \nobjection. The Government also provided military directives for administrative notice. \nThe Government\u2019s administrative notice documents were marked as Hearing Exhibit \n(HE) 1. Applicant did not object to the administrative notice documents. \n \n Applicant testified on his own behalf and called four witnesses. He introduced \ntwo exhibits, which were identified and marked as Exs. A and B. Applicant\u2019s exhibits \nwere admitted without objection. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) of the hearing on \nMay 12, 2010. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nThe SOR contains three allegations of disqualifying conduct under Guideline K, \nHandling Protected Information; two allegations of disqualifying conduct under Guideline \nE, Personal Conduct; and one allegation of disqualifying conduct under Guideline M, \nUse of Information Technology Systems. Applicant admitted all allegations in the SOR. \nHis admissions are admitted as findings of fact. (SOR; Answer to SOR.)  \n \n \nApplicant is 39 years old, married, and the father of four young children. Since \nAugust 2008, he has been employed by a government contractor. (Ex. 1; Tr. 26-27.) \n \n \nApplicant attended college on an ROTC scholarship and received a Bachelor of \nScience degree in Aviation Management. Applicant was commissioned as a U.S. \nmilitary officer and completed basic training before he resigned for health reasons. He \nworked in the private sector for about five and one-half years. He reentered the military \nin July 2000 and advanced to the rank of O-4. He deployed in 2008. He  completed his \nrequired active service and was honorably separated from active duty in September \n2008. During his military career, he served for over eight years as a logistics officer.  \n(Ex. 1; Ex. 2 at 4; Tr. 27-29.) \n \n \nIn about February 2007, while serving as a military officer, Applicant was \nassigned to serve as a program officer and to direct a testing and evaluation program \nfor a military application. Applicant was tasked with significant responsibilities and \nworked in an intense and stressful environment. He worked long hours and traveled \nfrequently. During this time, he lived with his family on a U.S. military installation, where \ncomponents of the testing and evaluation program were also located. (Tr. 29-32, 38-39, \n73-75.) \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \n                                           \n  \nAs a part of his duties during this time, Applicant drafted a security classification \nguide for his program. In August 2007, on a Friday afternoon, Applicant was working in \na secure facility on the base. He received an assignment to prepare a briefing on the \nstatus of two vendors in the testing and evaluation program for delivery the following \nMonday morning by the military official who directed the application program. Applicant \nknew that it would be necessary for him to acquire or access certain classified \ndocuments and photographs in order to complete the assignment. He also knew that to \ncomplete the assignment on time, it would be necessary to work over the upcoming \nweekend. All of the classified information that he needed to prepare the briefing could \nbe accessed from the secure facility where Applicant worked. (Ex. 3 at 1; Tr. 32-35, 74-\n79, 109-110.) \n \n \nApplicant, however, called a civilian contractor courier assigned to his program at \nan installation about two hours away by automobile and directed him to bring classified \ninformation, stored on computer disks, to him at the military base.1 The information on \nthe disks was accessible on the classified computer network available to Applicant at \nthe base. However, Applicant believed that downloading classified material from the \nclassified computer network would be slow and difficult. (Ex. 3 at 1-2; Tr. 73-74.) \n \n \nWhen a courier transporting classified information arrived at the base, he or she \nwould take the classified information to a secure command site, where it would be \nlogged in by a military officer of the day and secured in classified storage. However, \nwhen the courier arrived at the base carrying the classified information requested by \nApplicant, Applicant directed him to take the classified information to his residence, \nwhich was located on the base approximately three to four miles from the secure facility \nwhere Applicant worked. (Ex. 3 at 2; Tr. 75, 110-111.) \n \n \nAt his residence, Applicant took possession of the classified computer disks from \nthe courier. He told the courier he would not sign a chain of custody document when he \nreceived the classified materials. He acknowledged to the courier that he was breaking \nrules for the receipt and possession of classified information. He directed the courier not \nto tell anyone about his rule breaking. He then directed the courier to return to his \nresidence the following day, Saturday, to retrieve the classified documents and return \nthem to classified storage at the other installation. (Ex. 3 at 2; Tr. 74-77.)   \n \n \nOn Friday evening, Applicant worked with the classified information at his kitchen \ntable. He loaded the classified images and text onto his personal computer. He \ndescribed his actions as follows: \n \nI took the CDs of the vendors---or the ones I needed to have the \ninformation from, and put them on to an \u201cunclass computer.\u201d It wasn\u2019t \nhooked up to the Internet. It wasn\u2019t turned on, wireless. You know, I \ncouldn\u2019t - - I used a personal computer [be]cause my [government-issued] \n \n1 The courier was assigned to the program that Applicant directed. Applicant testified that he had the \nauthority to give the courier tasks and assignments. (Tr. 136-139.) \n\n \n4 \n \n \nlaptop wasn\u2019t working correctly to copy. I copied those videos, put all the \nCDs back together, burned the new disk, deleted everything off my \ncomputer, and everything back in the bag, and put it in my filing cabinet.  \n \n(Ex. 3; Tr. 80-81.) \n \n \nAs he worked on the classified materials at his kitchen table, his wife came into \nthe room. On February 6, 2008, Applicant provided the following description in a sworn, \nsigned statement to an authorized investigator: \n \nI admit that I did show my wife [name omitted] some clearly marked \n\u201cSecret\u201d videos that I had copied from the CDs to my personal laptop. I \nknow she does not have any sort of clearance, nor is she a government \nemployee or service member. She stopped by the table where I was \nworking so I showed her a video and stated, \u201cThis is part of the program.\u201d  \n \n \n(Ex. 3 at 2.) \n \n \nAt his hearing, Applicant described the same event as follows: \n \nYou know, I was sitting there, working, and, you know, my wife came \naround and said, \u201cWhat are you working on?\u201d I said, \u201cI\u2019m working on- - \ntrying to get this done for work, and - - and a video was playing at the \nsame time, and I said, \u201cThis is my work.\u201d She said, \u201cOh, okay,\u201d and off she \nwent. \n \n(Tr. 81.) \n  \n \nAt his hearing, Applicant denied deliberately showing his wife a classified video. \nHe stated that he was playing a classified video as a part of his work, and his wife \nhappened to see it as she came into the kitchen and asked about the work he was \ndoing. He replied to his wife\u2019s question by identifying the video as a part of his work. (Tr. \n114-116.) \n \n \nApplicant was tasked with preparing a classified briefing and unclassified \nmaterials that could also be distributed. As he prepared the briefing, Applicant had \naccess to unclassified photographs of the application that had previously been \ndistributed. As he reviewed the classified photographs on the videos he was using to \nprepare the classified briefing, Applicant decided that some of the photographs \ndesignated as classified had been mismarked. Applicant then cropped the classification \nmarkings from the classified pictures so that they could be put on an unclassified \ncomputer network (NIPERnet) and cleared for distribution. He testified that he did not \nhave classification authority; he also testified that he thought he had the authority to \nchange the classified photographs to unclassified by removing the classified designation \nfrom the photographs. (Tr. 77-78, 117-120.) \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \n                                           \n \nOn Friday evening, Applicant used the classified CDs to create smaller CDs \ncontaining the video and photographs of interest for the briefing. This process took \nabout four hours. After completing this process, he deleted the files from his personal \ncomputer.2 On Saturday, the contractor courier returned to Applicant\u2019s residence to \nretrieve the classified materials and return them to the secure site where they had been \nstored. (Ex. 3 at 2-3; Tr. 113-114.) \n \n \nApplicant did not work on the briefing on Saturday. On Sunday, he went to the \nsecure site on the base and used secure technology to assemble and complete the \nclassified briefing. As a part of that process, he loaded images he created from the \nclassified CDs he had placed on his unclassified personal computer onto the secure \nclassified network (SIPRnet). He completed the assignment and provided the military \nofficial with the materials and information he had requested for the Monday morning \nbriefing. (Tr. 84-85; 121-122.)   \n \n \nApplicant testified that as a military officer he had been trained in security \nprocesses and had worked extensively on the security classification guide for the \napplication program for which he served as a testing and evaluation program officer. He \nstated that he knew the rules and knew he was breaking them. He also stated that he \ndid not know he did not possess the authority to reclassify or declassify classified \ninformation until he took a basic information security independent study course in \nSeptember 2009.   (Ex. B; Tr. 85-86, 118-121.) \n \n \nThere were no immediate negative consequences to Applicant\u2019s actions in \ncarrying out the briefing assignment. Sometime after the August 2007 incident, \nApplicant assigned the contract courier to a component unit in another part of the United \nStates. At his new assignment, in about December 2008, the courier invited some other \nemployees to look at some classified videos on his non-secure laptop computer. The \nother employees informed Applicant of the courier\u2019s actions, and Applicant reported the \nindividual to the unit\u2019s security manager. When investigators questioned the courier, he \ntold them that Applicant had authorized him to put the classified videos on his laptop \ncomputer. (Ex. 3 at 3; Tr. 87-88, 122-123.)  \n \n \nApplicant speculated that the videos the courier had on his laptop computer \ncontained classified information that was on the CDs that he had brought to Applicant\u2019s \nresidence in August 2007. He realized that because the courier had implicated him, he \ntoo would be questioned and his actions investigated. He drafted a statement about his \nactions in August 2007 that he gave to his program manager. He then met with his \nimmediate supervisor and told him what he had done and how he had violated rules and \nregulations for protecting classified information. On November 30, 2007, Applicant\u2019s \ncommand was informed of his disregard for security requirements. As a consequence, \nApplicant\u2019s access to classified information was removed, his personal computer was \n \n2 Applicant described his actions as follows: \u201cAfter I had completed downloading the [classified] marked \nphotos and videos and burned them to two CD\u2019s, I went ahead and deleted the files, and then emptied \nthe recycle bin on my personal computer. I thought the files were completely removed from my personal \ncomputer.\u201d  (Ex. 3 at 2.) \n\n \n6 \n \n \nconfiscated for forensic analysis, and his actions were investigated by a military criminal \ninvestigation unit. (Ex. 7; Tr. 88-91, 122-124.) \n \n \nThe forensic analysis of Applicant\u2019s personal unclassified computer revealed the \n\u201cfingerprint\u201d of the classified files he copied to the computer when working in his \nresidence in August 2007. Applicant stated that when he deleted the classified files, he \ndid not understand that the fingerprint of the classified information remained on his \npersonal computer. (Tr. 89-90.)  \n \n \nOn May 5, 2008, Applicant\u2019s command conducted an Article 15 hearing into \nApplicant\u2019s conduct. Applicant received nonjudicial punishment for violation of a lawful \ngeneral regulation (Article 92) and was issued a punitive letter of reprimand. His \ncommander\u2019s report cited the following specific facts as determinative in the imposition \nof nonjudicial punishment: \u201cHaving access to materials classified as \u2018Secret,\u2019 [Applicant] \nviolated a lawful general regulation . . . by improperly handling and storing classified \nmaterial on his personal computer as he prepared an official brief for his command.\u201d \n(Ex. 6 a1; HE 1; Tr.39-40.)   \n \n \nApplicant asserted that he was confident that he would never violate security \nrules again. He discussed the lessons he had learned from his experience: \n \nJust, you know, shortcuts do not . . . save time. [L]ooking back, with the \nnumber of hours, you know, the disappointment, the regret . . . even my \nwife, who has . . . been aware of this for two and a half years now. . . [T]o \nlook at such a poor decision, to derail a career, to save a half a day\u2019s \nwork. I mean, it\u2019s just a reinforcement that you just can\u2019t take shortcuts . . .  \n[I]f I could go back in time . . . with . . . hindsight, out of a million times I\u2019d \nmake the correct choice a million times over. And you know . . . it\u2019s been a \nlesson to me.   \n \n(Tr. 107-108.) \n \n  \nThe SOR alleges a number of incidents that raised security concerns under \nGuidelines M, K, and E. Specifically, SOR \u00b6 1.a. alleges, under Guideline K, that \nApplicant improperly handled and stored classified information between about August \n11, 2007 until November 30, 2007, in violation of a lawful general military regulation, \nand, as a consequence of this violation, he received nonjudicial punishment under \nArticle 92 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ). The SOR alleges that this \nconduct also raises security concerns under Guideline E and Guideline M (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a. \nand 3.a.). \n \n \nThe SOR alleges at \u00b6 1.b. that Applicant raised security concerns under \nGuideline K when, in 2007, he removed secret classification markings from classified \nphotographs without authority so that he could move the classified photographs from a \nclassified computer network to an unclassified computer network. The SOR alleges that \n\n \n7 \n \n \nthis conduct also raises security concerns under Guideline E and Guideline M (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n2.a. and 3.a.). \n \n \nThe SOR alleges at \u00b6 1.c. that Applicant raised security concerns under \nGuideline K when, without authority, he showed classified material to his wife, who did \nnot have a security clearance or a need to know the classified information. This conduct \nis also alleged as a security concern under Guideline E (SOR \u00b6 2.a.). \n \n \nThe SOR alleges at \u00b6 2.b. that Applicant raised a security concern under \nGuideline E when he instructed a contract employee to carry classified information to \nhis residence in August 2007, when he knew that the instruction violated procedures for \nprotecting classified information, and also instructed the individual not to tell anyone of \nthe violation.     \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s former commanding officer, who presided at Applicant\u2019s Article 15 \nhearing, appeared as a witness on his behalf. He stated that Applicant performed his \nmilitary duties very well. He also observed that it was his conclusion that Applicant did \nnot intentionally pass classified material to anyone who should not have it. (Tr. 38-43.) \n \n \nThe president and vice president of the government contracting firm which \nemploys Applicant also appeared as witnesses. The president stated that he had met \nand worked with Applicant when he was in the military, and he noted that Applicant has \nbeen employed by his firm for about two and one-half years. He considers Applicant to \nbe a competent employee and a valued member of his team. The vice president praised \nApplicant\u2019s character as \u201coutstanding.\u201d (Tr. 52-66, 167.) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s supervisor also appeared as a witness. He described Applicant\u2019s \ncharacter as \u201ctop notch\u201d and his work performance as \u201cexemplary.\u201d (152-153.) \n \n \n                                                  Policies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the \nExecutive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security, and \nit has emphasized that \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the \nNavy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the \nauthority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine \nwhether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. \nat 527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.    \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, an   \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \n\n \n8 \n \n \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, the administrative judge applies these guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \nover-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of \nvariables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion in seeking to obtain a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline K, Handling Protected Information \n \n \nAG \u00b6 33 describes the Guideline K security concern as follows: \u201cDeliberate or \nnegligent failure to comply with rules and regulations for protecting classified or other \n\n \n9 \n \n \nsensitive information raises doubt about an individual\u2019s trustworthiness, judgment, \nreliability, or willingness and ability to safeguard such information. . . .\u201d \n \n \nThe SOR Guideline K allegations, which Applicant admitted, raise security \nconcerns under the following Guideline K disqualifying conditions: AG \u00b6\u00b6 34(a), 34(b), \n34(c), 34(e), and 35(g). AG \u00b6 34(a) reads: \u201cdeliberate or negligent disclosure of \nclassified or other protected information to unauthorized persons, including but not \nlimited to personal or business contacts, to the media, or to persons present at \nseminars, meetings, or conferences.\u201d AG \u00b6 34(b) reads: \u201ccollecting or storing classified \nor other protected information at home or in any other unauthorized location.\u201d AG \u00b6 \n34(c) reads: \u201cloading, drafting, editing, modifying, storing, transmitting, or otherwise \nhandling classified reports, data, or other information  on any unapproved equipment \nincluding but not limited to any typewriter, word processor, or computer hardware, \nsoftware, drive, system, gameboard, handheld, \u201cpalm,\u201d or pocket device or other adjunct \nequipment.\u201d AG \u00b6 34(e) reads: \u201ccopying classified or other protected information in a \nmanner designed to conceal or remove classification or other documents control \nmarking.\u201d AG \u00b6 34(g) reads: \u201cany failure to comply with rules for the protection of \nclassified or other sensitive information.\u201d \n \n \nUnder Guideline K, there are three mitigating conditions. AG \u00b6 35(a) reads: \u201cso \nmuch time has elapsed since the behavior, or it has happened so infrequently or under \nsuch unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d AG \u00b6 35(b) reads: \u201cthe \nindividual responded favorably to counseling or remedial security training and now \ndemonstrates a positive attitude toward the discharge of security responsibilities.\u201d AG \u00b6 \n35(c) reads: \u201cthe security violations were due to improper or inadequate training.\u201d \n \n \nThe incidents that gave rise to security concerns occurred in 2007, and they are \ntherefore recent. Applicant\u2019s security incidents did not take place under unusual \ncircumstances. Instead, they occurred during the normal course of his work, when he   \nwillfully carried out actions he knew to be in violation of rules for the protection of \nclassified information. Applicant was a career military officer; he knew the rules for \nprotecting classified information and chose to disregard them for his own convenience.  \nWhile he has subsequently taken remedial security training and appears positive about \ndischarging security responsibilities, he failed to offer a rational explanation for his \nformer security violations or to offer credible assurances that the behavior would not \nhappen again in the future. I conclude that none of the Guideline K mitigating conditions \napplies to the facts of Applicant\u2019s case. \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct  \n \n \n\u201cConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information.\u201d  AG \n\u00b615. \n \n \n\n \n10 \n \n \n \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant\u2019s failure to comply with rules and regulations \npertaining to handling protected information also raised security concerns under \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct. Specifically, allegations of Appellant\u2019s alleged personal \nconduct related to allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. through 1.c, which were cross-alleged \nunder Guideline E at SOR \u00b6 2.a. Additionally the SOR alleged disqualifying personal \nconduct when Applicant directed a contract employee to violate rules for protecting \nclassified information and then also directed him not to tell anyone of the violation. \n(SOR \u00b6 2.b.)  \n \n \nApplicant, a career military officer who had been thoroughly trained in procedures \nfor protecting classified information, knowingly violated those procedures and directed a \ncontract employee not to divulge one of his violations. Applicant concealed his violations \nfor several months. He did not reveal his disqualifying conduct until the contract \nemployee was investigated for a security breach and implicated Applicant. This conduct \nraises security concerns under AG \u00b616(e)(1), which reads: \u201cpersonal conduct, or \nconcealment of information about one\u2019s conduct, that creates a vulnerability to \nexploitation, manipulation, or duress, such as (1) engaging in activities which, if known, \nmay affect the person\u2019s personal, professional, or community standing.\u201d  \n \n \n \nSeveral Personal Conduct mitigating conditions might have applicability in this \ncase. If \u201cthe individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts,\u201d then AG \u00b6 17(a) \nmight apply. If \u201cthe offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or if it happened under such unique circumstances that it is unlikely to \nrecur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment,\u201d then AG \u00b6 17(c) might apply. If \u201cthe individual has acknowledged the \nbehavior and obtained counseling to change the behavior or taken other positive steps \nto alleviate the stressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur,\u201d then \nAG \u00b6 17(d) might apply. If \u201cthe individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress,\u201d then AG \u00b6 17(e) might be \napplicable. \n \n \nApplicant came forward after several months and admitted the conduct he had \nconcealed about his security violations, but only after he was implicated by the contract \nemployee. Accordingly, AG \u00b6 17(a) has limited applicability. Applicant\u2019s security \nviolations were not minor, and they occurred recently. They cast doubt on his reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and judgment. I conclude that AG \u00b6 17(c) does not apply. \n \n \nApplicant acknowledged that he knew the rules and regulations for protecting \nclassified information and chose nevertheless to violate them. He provided \ndocumentation showing that he had taken an independent study course in basic \nsecurity matters. AG \u00b6 17(d) therefore has some applicability. However, Applicant did \nnot provide evidence to establish that he had taken positive steps to reduce his \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress that was caused by concealing his \nsecurity violations. When Applicant admitted his rule-breaking conduct to his chain of \n\n \n11 \n \n \ncommand and to his supervisor, he lessened his vulnerability to exploitation, \nmanipulation, or duress. I conclude, therefore, that AG \u00b6 17(e) has some applicability to \nthe facts of this case.  \n \n  \nGuideline M, Use of Information Technology Systems \n \n \nAG \u00b6 39 describes the Guideline M security concern as follows: \n \nNoncompliance with rules, procedures, guidelines, or regulations \npertaining to information technology systems may raise security concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, calling into question \nthe willingness or ability to properly protect sensitive systems, networks, \nand information. Information Technology Systems include all related \ncomputer hardware, software, firmware, and data used for the \ncommunication, transmission, processing, manipulation, storage, or \nprotection of information. \n \n \nThe SOR cross-alleges at \u00b6 3.a. that the Guideline K conduct alleged at SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.a. and 1.b. also raises security concerns under Guideline M. In 2007, Applicant \nimproperly handled and stored classified information on his personal unclassified laptop \ncomputer, in violation of a lawful general regulation that he, as a military officer, was \nobligated to comply with. Additionally, even though he did not have authority to classify \nor declassify classified information, Applicant removed classified markings from \nclassified photographs in order to move them from a classified computer network to an \nunclassified network. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s actions raise Guideline M security concerns under AG \u00b6\u00b6 40(d) and \n40(f). AG \u00b6 40(d) reads: \u201cdownloading, storing, or transmitting classified information on \nor to any unauthorized software, hardware, or information technology systems.\u201d AG \u00b6 \n40(f) reads: \u201cintroduction, removal, or duplication of hardware, firmware, software, or \nmedia to or from any information technology system without authorization, when \nprohibited by rules, procedures, guidelines or regulations.\u201d \n \n \nThere are three conditions that could mitigate Guideline M security concerns.  If \n\u201cso much time has elapsed since the behavior happened, or it happened under such \nunusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment,\u201d then AG \u00b6 41(a) might apply.  \nIf \u201cthe misuse was minor and done only in the interest of organizational efficiency and \neffectiveness, such as letting another person use one\u2019s password or computer when no \nother timely alternative was readily available,\u201d then AG \u00b6 41(b) might apply.  Finally, if \n\u201cthe conduct was unintentional or inadvertent and was followed by a prompt good-faith \neffort to correct the situation and by notification of supervisor,\u201d then AG \u00b6 41(c) might \napply. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s disqualifying conduct, which occurred in 2007, is recent, did not occur \nunder unusual circumstances, and casts doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, and \n\n \n12 \n \n \ngood judgment. Applicant\u2019s misuse of information technology was not minor, and it was \nintentional. It was not done in the interest of organizational efficiency but to serve \nApplicant\u2019s own purposes. Applicant did not attempt to correct the situation and notify \nhis supervisor until he was implicated in the courier\u2019s security violation. I conclude that \nnone of the Guideline M mitigating conditions applies to the facts of Applicant\u2019s case.  \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is a mature adult. His \nformer commander and his current supervisor consider him to possess good character \nand to be a diligent employee. As a military officer trained in security procedures and in \nprotecting classified information, he chose to violate security rules and regulations to \nserve his own purposes. As a program officer and director of a component unit, \nApplicant also had responsibilities to lead by example and to model good procedures for \nthe protection of classified information. Instead, he violated security procedures by \nfailing to sign a chain of custody document when he took possession of classified \ninformation. He then elected to work on classified information in his home, an unsecure \nlocation, and he directed a courier not to tell anyone that he had violated security rules. \nHe concealed his security violations until he was implicated in the courier\u2019s later security \nviolation. \n \nI observed Applicant carefully at his security clearance hearing. Applicant was \nclearly concerned that his rule-breaking behavior caused damage to his career. He \nseemed to be less concerned about the impact his rule-breaking had on his unit and \nthose who reported to him. While he stated that he would never again violate \nregulations for the protection of classified information, Applicant\u2019s assertions were not \n\n \n13 \n \n \ncredible. I am not persuaded that, in the future, he would put the Government\u2019s interests \nbefore his own in the protection of classified information. \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s judgment and his eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude \nthat Applicant failed to mitigate security concerns arising under Guideline K, Guideline \nE, and Guideline M. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline K:  \n                    AGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a. through 1.c.:          Against Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \n         AGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a. and 2.b.: \n         Against  Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 3, Guideline M:  \n \n         AGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 3.a. :                                Against Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      Conclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is a 57-year-old quality assurance engineer of a defense contractor who seeks a security clearance. The allegations covered in the SOR and admitted to by Applicant are incorporated herein and adopted as relevant and material findings. Additional findings follow. Applicant has never been married and has no children. He was awarded a bachelor\u2019s of science degree in industrial engineering in 1975 (see ex. 1). Between 2000 and 2007, Applicant failed to file state and federal tax returns. His state\u2018s franchise tax board obtained judgments against him in 2003 to discharge a tax lien against him in the amount of $233,000, and in 2004 to discharge a tax lien against him for $67,896 (see exs. 6 and 7). Applicant has never paid anything towards the satisfaction of either state tax lien, and the tax liens remain outstanding (see exs. 4 and 5). 3 Applicant has never been assessed any tax liabilities or subjected to any enforcement actions by the IRS for any of the tax years (2000 through 2007), and does not know how much (if any) he might owe to the IRS at the present time for any of his prior tax years (Tr. 69-72). Although he did receive a refund check of $3,552 from the IRS in 2001, the check does not indicate the tax year, and was subsequently voided (see ex. K). Applicant has not made any payments to the IRS since 2000 and attributes any potential tax liability to the IRS\u2019 failure to properly calculate the differences in the cost of certain public stock he",

Howry, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\n______________\n Decision\n______________\nWESLEY, Roger C., Administrative Judge:\nStatement of Case\nOn September 11, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing reasons why DOHA could not make the\npreliminary affirmative determination of eligibility for granting a security clearance, and\nrecommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a security\nclearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. The action was taken\nunder Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry\n(February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense\nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2,1992), as\namended (Directive); and the revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AGs) promulgated by the\nPresident on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for\nSORs issued after September 1, 2006.\nApplicant responded to the SOR on October 13, 2009, and requested a hearing.\nThe case was assigned to me on November 17, 2009, and was scheduled for hearing\non January 12, 2010. The hearing was convened on the scheduled date for the purpose\nMarch 29, 2010\n\n2\nof considering whether it would be clearly consistent with the national interest to grant,\ncontinue, or deny, Applicant\u2019s application for a security clearance. At hearing, the\nGovernment's case consisted of seven exhibits; Applicant relied on one witness\n(himself) and nine exhibits. The transcript (R.T.) was received on January 26, 2010.\nBased upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for\naccess to classified information is denied. \nProcedural Rulings and Evidentiary Issues\nBefore the close of the hearing, Appellant requested leave to supplement the\nrecord with documented filed state and federal tax returns for 2001 and 2002. For good\ncause shown, Applicant was granted seven days to supplement the record. The\nGovernment was afforded two days to respond. Within the time permitted, Applicant\nsupplemented the record with a copied cover letter listing his enclosures, a voided 2001\nIRS refund check, a creditor monitoring alert related to the debt alleged in subparagraph\n1.e, a checking account statement reflecting payment of the debt alleged in\nsubparagraph 1.f, and a billing notice associated with the debt alleged in subparagraph\n1.f  Applicant\u2019s submissions were admitted as exhibits J through N. \nSummary of Pleadings\nUnder Guideline F, Applicant is alleged to (a) have filed no State A or federal tax\nreturns for the tax years of 2000 through 2007; (b) to be indebted to State A on a tax\nlien for $67,896; (c) ; to be indebted to State A on a tax lien for $233,000; and (d) to be\nindebted to two consumer creditors for $516 and $238, respectively.\nIn his response to the SOR, Applicant admitted to not filing his state and federal\ntax returns for the years 2000 through 2007, but denied the remaining allegations\nwithout any explanations.  He requested a copy of his investigative file. \n                                              \nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 57-year-old quality assurance engineer of a defense contractor\nwho seeks a security clearance.  The allegations covered in the SOR and admitted to by\nApplicant are incorporated herein and adopted as relevant and material findings.\nAdditional findings follow.\nApplicant has never been married and has no children. He was awarded a\nbachelor\u2019s of science degree in industrial engineering in 1975 (see ex. 1).\nBetween 2000 and 2007, Applicant failed to file state and federal tax returns.  His\nstate\u2018s franchise tax board obtained judgments against him in 2003 to discharge a tax\nlien against him in the amount of $233,000, and in 2004 to discharge a tax lien against\nhim for $67,896 (see exs. 6 and 7). Applicant has never paid anything towards the\nsatisfaction of either state tax lien, and the tax liens remain outstanding (see exs. 4 and\n5).  \n\n3\nApplicant has never been assessed any tax liabilities or subjected to any\nenforcement actions by the IRS for any of the tax years (2000 through 2007), and does\nnot know how much (if any) he might owe to the IRS at the present time for any of his\nprior tax years (Tr. 69-72).  Although he did receive a refund check of $3,552 from the\nIRS in 2001, the check does not indicate the tax year, and was subsequently voided\n(see ex. K). \nApplicant has not made any payments to the IRS since 2000 and attributes any\npotential tax liability to the IRS\u2019 failure to properly calculate the differences in the cost of\ncertain public stock he sold and what he sold the stock for following the collapse of the\ncompany in the wake of the terrorist attacks of September 2001 (see ex, 5; Tr. 74).  He\nhas never hired a tax preparer, accountant, or attorney, however, to help him with his\ntaxes (Tr. 84-88).\nSince 2002, his state\u2019s franchise tax board has garnished his wages at the rate of\n$500 a week.  He claims the state has recovered in excess of $19,000 a year on its tax\nliens (Tr. 64), and owes him money.  To date, the state has recovered over $50,000 in\ngarnished wages from his savings account, and over $2,000 from his checking account\n(Tr. 65-67). To date, though, he has taken no action to obtain refunds for any of the\nmonies he claims from the state (see ex. 5; Tr.  69-71).  \nApplicant attributes some of his filing delays to his recurrent medical problems,\nwhich cause fatigue, numbness, and stress in handling papers, and walking (Tr. 73-79)\nHe still feels the financial repercussions of his lost company stock in a major American\ncompany (Tr. 73=74). He has no tax or payment documentation in his possession to\ncorroborate his claims.\nBesides his tax debts and filing problems, Applicant incurred two smaller\nconsumer debts.  These debts are covered by subparagraph 1.e ($516) and 1.f ($238).\nApplicant documents his payment of the creditor 1.e debt (see exs. 2, 4, and M), but not\nhis creditor 1.f debt (see exs. 2 and N).  He has no payment receipts for his creditor 1.f\naccount (Tr. 92-93).\nApplicant has a net income of around $4,000 a month (see ex. 5).  He has about\n$40,000 in his savings account and $1,500 in cash. He estimates to have about\n$600,000 in his 401(k) stock portfolio and $20,000 in home equity (ex. 5).  \nAfforded an opportunity to supplement the record, Applicant did not provide any\ncharacter references or personnel evaluations from his employer. Potentially helpful but\nnot available either are his performance evaluations and any awards and meritorious\ncitations he may have earned.  \nPolicies\nThe AGs list guidelines to be used by administrative judges in the decision-\nmaking process covering DOHA cases. These guidelines take into account factors that\n\n4\ncould create a potential conflict of interest for the individual applicant, as well as\nconsiderations that could affect the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to\nprotect classified information. These guidelines include \"[c]onditions that could raise a\nsecurity concern and may be disqualifying\u201d (disqualifying conditions), if any, and many\nof the \"[c]onditions that could mitigate security concerns.\u201d These guidelines must be\nconsidered before deciding whether or not a security clearance should be granted,\ncontinued, or denied. The guidelines do not require administrative judges to place\nexclusive reliance on the enumerated disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the\nguidelines in arriving at a decision. Each of the guidelines is to be evaluated in the\ncontext of the whole person in accordance with AG \u00b6 2(c) \nIn addition to the relevant AGs, administrative judges must take into account the\npertinent considerations for assessing extenuation and mitigation set forth in AG \u00b6 2(a)\nof the revised AGs, which are intended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and\nimpartial commonsense decision based upon a careful consideration of the pertinent\nguidelines within the context of the whole person. The adjudicative process is designed\nto examine a sufficient period of an applicant\u2019s life to enable predictive judgments to be\nmade about whether the applicant is an acceptable security risk. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s conduct, the relevant guidelines are to be\nconsidered together with the following AG \u00b6 2(a) factors: (1) the nature, extent, and\nseriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which\nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\npermanent behavioral chances; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for\npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or\nrecurrence.\nViewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following adjudication\npolicy concerns are pertinent herein:\nFinancial Considerations\nThe Concern: Failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy\ndebts and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of\njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which\ncan raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and\nability to protect classified information.  An individual who is financially\noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate\nfunds.  Compulsive gambling is a concern as it may lead to financial\ncrimes including espionage.  Affluence that cannot be explained by known\nsources of income is also a security concern.  It may indicate proceeds\nfrom financially profitable criminal acts. AG \u00b6 18.\n\n5\nBurden of Proof\nUnder the Directive, a decision to grant or continue an applicant's request for\nsecurity clearance may be made only upon a threshold finding that to do so is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest.  Because the Directive requires administrative\njudges to make a commonsense appraisal of the evidence accumulated in the record,\nthe ultimate determination of an applicant's eligibility for a security clearance depends, in\nlarge part, on the relevance and materiality of that evidence. As with all adversarial\nproceedings, the judge may draw only those inferences which have a reasonable and\nlogical basis from the evidence of record.  Conversely, the judge cannot draw factual\ninferences that are grounded on speculation or conjecture.\nThe Government's initial burden is twofold: (1) it must prove by substantial\nevidence any controverted facts alleged in the SOR; and (2) it must demonstrate that the\nfacts proven have a material bearing to the applicant's eligibility to obtain or maintain a\nsecurity clearance.  The required showing of material bearing, however, does not require\nthe Government to affirmatively demonstrate that the applicant has actually mishandled\nor abused classified information before it can deny or revoke a security clearance.\nRather, consideration must take account of cognizable risks that an applicant may\ndeliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information.\nOnce the Government meets its initial burden of proof of establishing admitted or\ncontroverted facts, the burden of proof shifts to the applicant for the purpose of\nestablishing his or his security worthiness through evidence of refutation, extenuation or\nmitigation of the Government's case.  Because Executive Order 10865 requires that all\nsecurity clearances be clearly consistent with the national interest, \u201csecurity-clearance\ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d See Department of the\nNavy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988).\nAnalysis  \nApplicant is a longstanding employee of a defense contractor who failed to file\nstate and federal tax returns over an extended period (between 2000 and 2007).  While\nthere are no federal tax liens of record, his state\u2019s franchise tax board has tax liens filed\nagainst him in excess of $300,000.  None of these liens have been discharged to date.\nBesides his tax liens, Applicant accumulated two small consumer debts totaling about\n$700.\nSecurity concerns are raised under the financial considerations guideline of the\nAGs where the individual applicant is so financially overextended as to indicate poor self-\ncontrol, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, which can\nraise questions about the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information, and place the person at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to\ngenerate funds. Applicant\u2019s failure to file state and federal tax returns and his\naccumulation of state tax liens and other delinquent debts warrant the application of\nthree of the disqualifying conditions (DC) of the Guidelines for financial considerations: \u00b6\n\n6\nDC 19(a) \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts,\u201d DC \u00b6 19(c) \u201ca history of not meeting\nfinancial obligations,\u201d and DC \u00b6 19(g), \u201cfailure to file annual federal, state, or local income\ntax returns as required or the fraudulent filing of the same.\u201d\nApplicant\u2019s failure to file tax returns and accrual of state tax liens are for the most\npart unexplained. He attributes some of his failures to medical conditions and slow\nreactions, but cannot reconcile his actions with his ability to maintain a demanding\nengineering position with the same defense contractor over a 15-year period.  To date,\nhe has not been able to effectuate any repayment plans with the state\u2019s franchise tax\nboard that do not involve involuntary garnishment.  Without filed taxed returns with both\ntaxing jurisdictions, it is impossible to know just what Applicant owes the state and the\nIRS at this time. \nApplicant does not provide adequate explanations either as to why he has not\nmade more concerted earlier attempts to work out filing and payment arrangements with\nthe state and the IRS.  If, as Applicant claims, both taxing authorities owe him money, he\nshould encounter little difficulty fashioning settlement arrangements with them.\nMitigation credit to Applicant is very limited based on his furnished proofs. Besides\nthe one small consumer debt that he paid (creditor 1.e), Applicant has made no tangible\neffort to file state and federal tax returns for the years covered in the SOR (2000 through\n2007), or address any of the state taxes covered by the liens filed against him by the\nstate\u2019s taxing authority. \nAccordingly, Applicant remains delinquent in the filing of his personal state and\nfederal tax returns for the covered years (2000 through 2007) and for back taxes owed\nthe state for the years named in the state\u2019s two outstanding tax liens.  As a result, MC \u00b6\n20(a), \u201cthe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under\ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s\nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment,\u201d cannot be applied to Applicant\u2019 situation.\nMC \u00b6 20 (d), \u201cthe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or\notherwise resolve debts,\u201d has some limited applicability based on Applicant\u2019s\ndocumented payment of one of his two smaller consumer creditors.                                  \n                  \nBecause Applicant has not chosen to seek any counseling advice relative to his\nidentified tax filing and tax lien delinquencies, he may not take any advantage of MC  \u00b6\n20(c), \u201cthe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there\nare clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control.\u201d  Considered\ntogether, Applicant\u2019s efforts are not enough to warrant any more than partial application\nof MC \u00b6 20(c).  \nHolding a security clearance involves the exercise of important fiducial\nresponsibilities, among which is the expectancy of consistent trust and candor.  Financial\nstability in a person cleared to access classified information is required precisely to\ninspire trust and confidence in the holder of the clearance.  While the principal concern of\n\n7\na clearance holder\u2019s demonstrated financial difficulties is vulnerability to coercion and\ninfluence, judgment and trust concerns are implicit in financial cases (as here).\nWhole person assessment does not help Applicant to overcome the judgment\nlapses associated with his tax filing failures, tax debt accumulations, and his still\noutstanding consumer debt.  His long work history with the same defense contractor is\ncommendable and deserving of considerable praise.  His failure, though, to diligently\nmonitor and ensure timely tax filings and discharge of the outstanding state tax liens\nagainst him  reflects the lack of adequate attention to meeting his tax responsibilities.\nSecurity concerns associated with Applicant\u2019s filing deficiencies and accrued state tax\nand consumer debts are not mitigated under the whole person concept.\nTaking into account all of the facts and circumstances surrounding Applicant\u2019s tax\nfiling deficiencies and unresolved state tax liens and the absence of any meaningful\nefforts to demonstrate his financial responsibility and trustworthiness in managing his\nfinances, Applicant does not mitigate security concerns related to his proven tax filing\nand debt delinquencies.  Unfavorable conclusions warrant with respect to the allegations\ncovered by subparagraphs 1a through 1.d and 1.f of the SOR.  Favorable conclusions\nwarrant with respect to subparagraph 1.e.\nIn reaching my decision, I have considered the evidence as a whole, including\neach of the AG 2(a) factors enumerated in the AGs of the Directive.\nFormal Findings\nIn reviewing the allegations of the SOR and ensuing conclusions reached in the\ncontext of the findings of fact, conclusions, conditions, and the factors listed above, I\nmake the following formal findings:\nGUIDELINE F: (FINANCIAL CONSIDERATIONS):\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparas. 1.a through 1.d and 1.f:\nAgainst Applicant    \nSubpara.  1.e\n                                For Applicant\nConclusions\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s security\nclearance.

Howry, Esquire, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: pro se \n \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \nCREAN, Thomas M., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-\nQIP) for his employment with a defense contractor on June 4, 2008 (Gov X 4). On \nOctober 28, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under Guideline H (Drug \nInvolvement), and Guideline E (Personal Conduct) (Gov X 1). The action was taken \nunder Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \n(February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive), and the revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) promulgated by the \nPresident on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for \nSORs issued after September 1, 2006. Applicant received the SOR on November 11, \n2009 (Gov X 3 at 3). \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on November 12, 2009. His responses to \nthe personal conduct security concern were inconsistent. Applicant denied the three \nfactual allegations, but admitted the security concern. If Applicant does not admit the \nfactual allegations, there is no security concern to admit. I find based on his answers to \nthe factual allegations that Applicant denied the security concern under Guideline E. \nMarch 30, 2010\n\n \n2 \n \nApplicant admitted the factual allegation under Guideline H pertaining to a positive \nurinalysis test, but denied the factual allegations concerning use of marijuana from 1996 \nuntil May 2007. He admitted the drug involvement security concern. He stated that he \npassed another urinalysis test a week after the one he failed. Applicant elected to have \nthe matter decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing (Gov X 3). \n \n \nDepartment Counsel submitted the government\u2019s written case on December 31, \n2009. Applicant received a complete file of relevant material (FORM) on January 22, \n2010, and was provided the opportunity to file objections and submit material to refute, \nextenuate, or mitigate the security concerns. He did not provide additional information. \nThe case was assigned to me on March 22, 2010. Based upon a review of the case file, \neligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant admitted only one of the factual allegations under Guidelines H, and \ndenied all factual allegations under Guideline E. I carefully reviewed the case file and \nthe pleadings, and make the following findings of fact. \n \nApplicant is a 53-year-old college graduate who has worked for a defense \ncontractor as an engineer and technician for over two years. He is divorced with two \nchildren. He served nine years on active duty in the Navy. Applicant completed his \nsecurity clearance application on June 4, 2008. Applicant responded \"No\" to questions \nconcerning his use of illegal drugs. He stated in response to a question asking if he was \never fired from a job, that he was fired from a job for failing a urinalysis (Gov. X 4).  \n \n \nApplicant was interviewed by security investigators concerning his use of drugs \non October 6, 2008. He admitted using marijuana from 1996 when he left the Navy until \nhis last admitted use of marijuana in 2002 or 2003. He was asked about his termination \nfrom a job because he failed a drug urinalysis for marijuana in May 2007. He does not \nknow why the test was positive because he had not used marijuana since 2003 or 2003. \nHe did claim that his friends used marijuana and that is a possible reason for the \npositive test.  \n \n \nApplicant told security investigators in the same interview that he does not intend \nto use marijuana in the future. He did not provide information to investigators that he \nhad treatment or counseling for drug use. He told investigators that he has not used \nother drugs. However, he is still friends with those that do use drugs, but he does not \nparticipate in their drug use. Applicant stated that his \"no\" answer to illegal drug use on \nthe security clearance application was based on the fact he had not used marijuana \nsince 2002 to 2003, and marijuana use was no longer relevant to him. He did admit to \nsmoking marijuana socially once or twice a year because of peer pressure after leaving \nthe Navy in 1996 (Gov X 5). \n \nApplicant stated in response to a DOHA interrogatory that he had not soberly or \nconsciously used marijuana since the spring of 2002. He avoids places where \n\n \n3 \n \nmarijuana is used because he does not feel it is in his best interest to frequent these \nplaces (Gov X 6). \n \n \nIn response to another DOHA interrogatory, Applicant stated he failed a \nurinalysis in April 2007 given for employment with a temporary employment service, but \npassed a urinalysis for a different employer in June 2007. However, the test results \nshow that the test for the temporary employment agency was administered on May 23, \n2007, and the positive marijuana use result was reported on June 21, 2007 (Gov X 7).  \n \n \nI find that Applicant failed a urinalysis drug test for marijuana in May 2007. \nApplicant's statement that he tested negative for marijuana use about one month later is \nonly evidence that he did not use marijuana after the May 2007 positive test. It is not \nevidence that he did not use marijuana prior to the May 2007 positive drug test. Based \non this positive drug test for marijuana, I find Applicant used the illegal drug marijuana in \n2007. There is ample evidence that Applicant used illegal drugs in varying frequency \nfrom 1996 until 2007, based on Applicant's admission to drug use after leaving the Navy \nin 1996 until 2003, and the 2007 positive test for illegal drugs, \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised Administrative Guidelines. In addition to \nbrief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by department counsel. . .\u201d The \napplicant has the burden of persuasion to obtaining a favorable security decision.  \n\n \n4 \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement \n \nThe use of an illegal drug can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability and \ntrustworthiness, because it may impair judgment and raises questions about a person\u2019s \nability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. Drugs are mood and \nbehavior altering substances, and include those listed in the Controlled Substances Act \nof 1970. Marijuana is listed in the Act. Drug abuse is the illegal use of a drug or the use \nof a legal drug in a manner that deviates from approved medical direction (AG \u00b6 24).  \n \n \nThe first factual allegation under drug involvement involves marijuana use with \nvarying frequency from about 1996 until May 2007 (SOR 2a). Applicant admitted using \nmarijuana from 1996 until 2002 or 2003. He tested positive for marijuana in a May 2007 \nurinalysis. The second factual allegation concerns the May 2007 positive test for \nmarijuana. Applicant denies use of marijuana after 2002 to 2003. He cannot explain the \npositive test except that he was in places where his friends used marijuana. While there \nis no direct evidence of marijuana use between 2002 or 2003 and May 2007, the fact \nthat Applicant tested positive for marijuana in May 2007 indicates he has used \nmarijuana since 2003. The government established the factual allegation. Applicant has \nnot presented sufficient information to rebut the factual allegation.  \n \n \nI have considered the Drug Involvement Mitigating Conditions (DI MC) and find \nnone apply. Applicant admitted using marijuana for an extended period of time from \n1996 until 2003. I find that he used marijuana after 2003, at least until May 2007, when \nhe tested positive for marijuana use. His use of marijuana is recent and frequent since it \noccurred as late as 2007. DI MC AG \u00b6 26(a) (the behavior happened so long ago, was \nso infrequent, or happened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur \nor does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment) does not apply.  \n \n \nApplicant stated he does not intend to use marijuana in the future. He also stated \nthat he is still friends with those that do use marijuana, but does not participate with \nthem in the marijuana use. This statement about being with marijuana using friends but \nnot using marijuana is not valid evidence to show intent not to use marijuana in the \nfuture. He has not received any counseling for illegal drug use nor does he participate in \nany drug avoidance programs. Applicant has a long history of marijuana use, but his \n\n \n5 \n \nintent not to use marijuana is only recent and in response to questions from security \ninvestigators. The 2007 failed drug test for marijuana is a further indication he continues \nto use illegal drugs. Applicant has not presented sufficient information of changed \ncircumstances to  indicate and validate his intent not to use illegal drugs in the future. DI \nMC AG \u00b6 26(b) (a demonstrated intent not to abuse drugs in the future, such as; (1) \ndisassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; (2) changing or avoiding the \nenvironment where drugs were used; (3) an appropriate period of abstinence; (4) a \nsigned statement of intent with automatic revocation of clearance for any violation) does \nnot apply because he failed to provide evidence to support the mitigating condition. \nGuideline H is decided against Applicant \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \n \nA security concern is raised because conduct involving questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations \ncan raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful and candid \nanswers during the security clearance process or any other failure to cooperate with the \nsecurity clearance process (AG \u00b6 15). Personal conduct is always a security concern \nbecause it asks the central question does the person\u2019s past conduct justify confidence \nthe person can be entrusted to properly safeguard classified information. The security \nclearance system depends on the individual providing correct and accurate information. \nIf a person conceals or provides false information, the security clearance process \ncannot function properly to ensure that granting access to classified information is in the \nbest interest of the United States Government.  \n \n \nApplicant answered \"no\" to a question on his June 2008 security clearance \napplication concerning his use of marijuana from 1996 until May 2007. He told security \ninvestigators in October 2008, and responded to DOHA interrogatories in April 2009, \nthat he had not used marijuana since 2002. The positive test for marijuana use in May \n2007, has not been explained and is sufficient evidence for a finding that Applicant used \nmarijuana until at least May 2007. Applicant's statement that he tested negative for \nmarijuana use about one month later is not evidence that he did not use marijuana prior \nto the positive drug test in May 2007, but only evidence he did not use marijuana from \nMay 2007 until the test in June 2007. His failure to respond accurately to using \nmarijuana after 2003 as evidenced by the May 2007 failed urinalysis raises concerns \nunder Personal Conduct Disqualifying Condition (PC DC) AG \u00b6 16(a) (the deliberate \nomission, concealment, or falsification of relevant and material facts from any personnel \nsecurity questionnaire, personal history, or similar form used to conduct investigations, \nto determine security eligibility or trustworthiness). \n \n \nApplicant deliberately failed to provide accurate information concerning his illegal \ndrug use. While there is a security concern for an omission, concealment, or falsification \nof a material fact in any written document or oral statement to the government when \napplying for a security clearance, every omission, concealment, or inaccurate statement \nis not a falsification. A falsification must be deliberate and material. It is deliberate if it is \ndone knowingly and willfully. Applicant tested positive for marijuana in May 2007. He \n\n \n6 \n \nindicated the date of the test as April 2007. However, the test results clearly show the \ntest was administered on May 23, 2007, for pre-employment with the temporary \nemployment agency. There is no confusion on the results of the test. I find that \nApplicant deliberately failed to disclose his illegal drug use evidenced by the positive \ntest results for marijuana. I find against Applicant as to Personal Conduct.   \n \n \u201cWhole-Person\u201d Analysis  \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge evaluates the \napplicant\u2019s conduct and all of the circumstances. An administrative judge should \nconsider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant a security clearance \nmust be an overall commons sense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nguidelines and the whole-person concept.   \n \n \nApplicant has not established that he is trustworthy, reliable, and exercises good \njudgment.  To the contrary, he used marijuana recently and frequently. He did not \nprovide full and complete information about his drug use on his security clearance \napplication, in response to interrogatories, and questions of security investigators. Even \nthough he stated he does not intend to use illegal drugs in the future, he did not present \nsufficient information to support his intent. Applicant used marijuana and has not \nprovided sufficient evidence to convince me he should be trusted with access to \nclassified information. The record evidence leaves me with questions about Applicant\u2019s \neligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, Applicant has not \nmitigated drug involvement and personal conduct security concerns.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline E:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.c:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline H:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a - 2.b: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n_________________ \nTHOMAS M. CREAN \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Murphy, Esquire, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nDAM, Shari, Administrative Judge: \n \n \nBased upon a review of the record evidence as a whole, eligibility for access to \nADP I/II/III sensitive information is granted. \n \nOn April 9, 1993, the Composite Health Care Systems Program Office \n(CHCSPO), the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), and the Assistant \nSecretary of Defense for Command, Control, Communications and Intelligence \n(ASDC3I), entered into a memorandum of agreement for DOHA to provide \ntrustworthiness determinations for contractor personnel employed in Sensitive \nInformation Systems Positions (ADP I/II/III), as defined in the Department of Defense \n(DoD) Regulation 5200.2-r, Personnel Security Program (January 1987), as amended \n(Regulation).  \n \nOn November 1, 2006, Applicant completed her Public Trust Position Application \n(SF 85P) and re-certified it on March 11, 2008. On July 24, 2009, the Defense Office of \nHearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant \ndetailing security concerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations). The action \nMay 28, 2010\n\n \n \n \n \n2\nwas taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, \nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive); and the Adjudicative Guidelines effective within the Department of \nDefense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on August 3, 2009, and requested a \nhearing before an administrative judge. On October 6, 2009, DOHA assigned the case \nto another administrative judge. On December 4, 2009, DOHA re-assigned the case to \nme. On February 25, 2010, DOHA issued a Notice of Hearing setting the case for March \n30, 2010. The case was heard as scheduled.  Department Counsel offered Government \nExhibits (GE) 1 through 7 into evidence without objection. Applicant testified. She \noffered Applicant Exhibits (AE) 1 through 10 into evidence without objection. The record \nremained open until April 16, 2010, to give Applicant an opportunity to submit additional \ninformation. On April 8, 2010, Applicant submitted three documents that I marked as AE \n11, 12, and 13. On April 13, 2010, she submitted three documents that I marked as AE \n14, 15, and 16. All additional exhibits were admitted into evidence without objection.  \nDOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on April 9, 2010.                                                         \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn her Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the nine allegations contained in \nSOR \u00b6 1, and provided information in support of her answers.  \n \n \nApplicant is 49-years-old and never married. In spring 1985, she completed a \nbachelor\u2019s degree. In fall 1987, she entered medical school. In October 1989, she \nwithdrew from medical school after being diagnosed with severe depression. By that \ntime, she had accumulated $50,000 in student loans. (Tr.  34.)  \n \n \nIn 1996, Applicant moved to another state to work as an administrative assistant \nfor a not-for-profit organization with an annual salary of $37,000. She remained there \nuntil 2001 at which time the person that hired her died. She was then laid off and used \nher savings for living expenses. (Answer at 3.) At the time of the layoff, she was earning \n$57,000 annually. She remained unemployed for almost a year. In 2003, she returned \nto her hometown and a $22,000 position. Sometime later, she suffered a severe \ndepressive episode and was forced to take a reduction in hours and pay.  \nSubsequently, she lost her position. She was unemployed for approximately four \nmonths until finding a position at a social services center. (Tr. 31.) In 2004, she earned \n$14,000. In 2005, she earned $25,300. For most of 2006, she was again unemployed \nand received unemployment benefits of $6,800. (AE 6.) In November 2006, she began \nher current position as an administrative assistant with a federal contractor in a \ndepartment that handles medical records. Her hourly rate is $12.72, with a current \nannual salary of around $24,000. (Answer at 3; AE 5.)       \n \n \n \nSometime in the late 1990s, Applicant\u2019s physician diagnosed her with Type II Bi-\npolar disorder. As a consequence of that disorder, Applicant has incurred significant \n\n \n \n \n \n3\npsychotherapy and medication expenses. Currently, she pays $140 monthly for \nmedication and physician\u2019s office visits. Periodic psychotherapy increases her monthly \nexpenses. The combination of medication and psychotherapy stabilize her mood \ndisorder. (Answer at 4.) \n \n \n \nApplicant did not have financial difficulties or delinquent debts until she lost her \njob in 2001. Up to that point, she was paying her debts and making payments on her \nstudent loan. She had reduced her student loan balance to $35,000. \n \n \nBased on credit bureau reports (CBR) dated March 2008, January 2009, and \nMarch 2010, the SOR alleged that Applicant accumulated eight delinquent debts \ntotaling $59,465 and a wage garnishment for delinquent student loans. (GE 2, 3, and 7.) \nThe debts started to accrue in 2003, when she began using credit cards for medical and \nhousehold expenses after exhausting her savings. The status of each debt is listed \nbelow: \n \n \n1.  (\u00b6 1.a) The $982 judgment is unpaid.  \n \n2.  (\u00b6 1.b) The $3,282 debt is owed to a credit card company. It is unpaid. \n \n3.  (\u00b6 1.c) The $1,252 debt is owed to a credit card company. It is unpaid. \n \n \n4. (\u00b6 1.d) The $4,945 debt is owed to a credit card company. It is unpaid.  \n \n5. (\u00b6 1.e) The $6,477 debt is owed to a credit card company for a loan. It is \nunpaid. \n \n6. (\u00b6 1.f) The $22,910 is owed to a credit card company. Applicant thinks the \nprincipal balance was around $4,000 when she stopped making payments. It is \nunpaid. \n \n \n7. (\u00b6 1.g) The $954 debt is owed to a department store. It is unpaid. \n \n8. (\u00b6 1.h) The $18,663 debt is owed a credit card company. She settled the \naccount for $3,000. After receiving her tax refund, she made a $1,000 \npayment and has been making monthly payments of $50 since September \n2009. The balance is $1,750. (AE 1, 2, 3, and 9.)     \n \n9. (\u00b6 1.i) Since late 2008, Applicant has made monthly payments of $142 on her \nstudent loan through a garnishment order. (AE 4.) The balance on the loan is \n$98,764, of which about $62,000 is interest and penalties. (AE 14.)  \n \n \nApplicant submitted her budget. Her monthly gross income is around $1,454 and \nexpenses are $1,290.  After paying her student loan, she has little money left for other \ndebt reduction payments. (GE 4 at 18.) She no longer uses credit cards. (Tr. 47.) She is \nnot accumulating new debt.  About five years ago, she took a budgeting class as part of \n\n \n \n \n \n4\ncredit counseling. She repeated the class a year and a half ago. Subsequently, she \nspoke to a debt consolidation company and learned that she does not earn enough \nmoney to establish a debt consolidation plan. (Tr. 44-45.) \n \n \nApplicant submitted copies of her 2008 and 2009 performance evaluations. She \nreceived a \u201cMeets Expectation\u201d in 2008 and an \u201cExceeds Expectations\u201d in 2009. (AE 12, \n13.) The Director of Applicant\u2019s department wrote a letter stating that since meeting her \nin November 2006, he has found Applicant to be a reliable and motivated employee. \n(AE 15.) A manager in her office stated that Applicant \u201cis accomplished in all areas of \nher job description and serves a mentor for others during their learning process and \nseeks ways to continuously challenge herself.\u201d (AE 16.)    \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s psychiatrist and therapist submitted a letter. They commend her for \npersistently pursuing good health and complying with her treatment plan. They stated, \n\u201cWe both know this individual very well and attest to her honesty, her sense of \nresponsibility and integrity and her high moral character. She currently lives a \nproductive and satisfying life. We see her as posing no security risk whatsoever.\u201d (AE \n10.) \n \n \n \nApplicant testified candidly and forthrightly. She exhibited an in-depth knowledge \nabout her financial situation and delinquent debts. She presented her case in an \norganized manner. She consistently asserted that she would like to pay her delinquent \ndebts, but does earn enough money. She testified that \u201cI own these debts. I was put in \nthis situation that was a very tough situation, but yes, they are my debts and I will try to \nresolve them however I can. My last resort would be bankruptcy.\u201d (Tr. 49.) \n \nPolicies \n \nPositions designated as ADP I and ADP II are classified as \u201csensitive positions.\u201d \n(See Regulation \u00b6\u00b6 C3.1.2.1.1.7 and C3.1.2.1.2.3.) \u201cThe standard that must be met for . \n. . assignment to sensitive duties is that, based on all available information, the person\u2019s \nloyalty, reliability, and trustworthiness are such that . . . assigning the person to \nsensitive duties is clearly consistent with the interests of national security.\u201d (See \nRegulation \u00b6 C6.1.1.1.) The Deputy Under Secretary of Defense (Counterintelligence \nand Security) Memorandum, dated November 19, 2004, indicates trustworthiness \nadjudications will apply to cases forwarded to DOHA by the Defense Security Service \nand Office of Personnel Management. Department of Defense contractor personnel are \nafforded the right to the procedures contained in the Directive before any final \nunfavorable access determination may be made. (See Regulation \u00b6 C8.2.1.)  \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a public trust position, the \nadministrative judge must consider the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the \nAdjudicative Guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, \nrecognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \n\n \n \n \n \n5\nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \n[sensitive] information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \n \nAccording to Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to \nestablish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201c[t]he \napplicant is responsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, \nextenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, \nand has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable [trustworthiness] \ndecision.\u201d \n \n \nA person who applies for access to sensitive information seeks to enter into a \nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to sensitive information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard sensitive information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nsensitive information.  \n \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that \u201c[a]ny determination under this \norder adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest \nand shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d \nSee also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified \nor sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG & 18:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \n\n \n \n \n \n6\noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \nAG \u00b6 19 describes two conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying: \n(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and \n (c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.  \nApplicant started accumulating delinquent debt in 2003 after losing her job and \ndepleting her savings. She had insufficient money to pay them. Seven of the SOR \nallegations remain unpaid or unresolved. The evidence is sufficient to raise these \npotentially disqualifying conditions.  \nAG \u00b6 20 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising from a \nhistory of unpaid debt. Since Applicant did not dispute the legitimacy of any SOR-listed \ndebt or the garnishment, the four potentially pertinent conditions are: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control; \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant\u2019s started accumulating debts seven years ago as a result of periods of \nunemployment, underemployment, and large medical expenses, which causes do not \nreflect on her current reliability, trustworthiness, or judgment. Her debts are on-going \nbecause she has not earned sufficient money since 2001 to resolve them. Accordingly, \nshe established some mitigation under AG \u00b6 20(a).   \nSimilarly, AG \u00b6 20(b) has application due to the unforeseen circumstances \nmentioned above. However, this mitigating condition has limited application because \nApplicant did not present sufficient documentation to demonstrate that she attempted to \nmanage the debts while they were accumulating.  \n\n \n \n \n \n7\n \nApplicant participated in financial counseling five years ago and again a year and \na half ago. As a consequence, she established a budget, which based on her income, \nleaves little discretionary money at the end of the month to make payments on more \nthan two debts. She no longer uses credit cards and has not assumed new debt. There \nare some indications that her problems are slowly coming under control, warranting a \nlimited application of AG \u00b6 20(c). She is resolving an $18,663 debt for $3,000 through a \nrepayment plan and has been paying her student loan since 2008, albeit slowly and \nthrough a garnishment. Her negotiation and settlement of one debt demonstrated a \ngood-faith effort to repay her creditors, and trigger the application of AG \u00b6 20(d) as to \nthat debt (\u00b6 1.h).  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a public trust position by considering the totality of applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a). They include the following:  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a public \ntrust position must include an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nrelevant facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is a hard-working, \nintelligent 49-year-old woman, who is successfully working for a federal contractor as \ndocumented by her supervisors. Applicant\u2019s conduct of concern involves delinquent \ndebts incurred over seven years and during periods of involuntary unemployment, \nunderemployment, and ongoing medical expenses. Her unresolved delinquent debt \nincludes about $40,000 in old credit card debt and $98,000 in student loans, of which \nmore than 60% is interest and penalties. Applicant credibly accepts responsibility for the \ndebts and would like to pay them. Her commitment to resolving them diminishes any \npotential for coercion or duress, as does her monthly repayments. She now has steady \nemployment and sufficient income to meet her living expenses without incurring further \ndelinquencies; however, she has little money available at the end of the month to pay \nmore than the $200 she has budgeted for one debt and her student loan.  \n \n\n \n \n \n \n8\nIn evaluating guideline F cases, the Appeal Board has previously noted that the \nAdministrative Judge can reasonably consider the entirety of an applicant\u2019s financial \nsituation and his actions in evaluating the extent to which that applicant\u2019s plan for the \nreduction of his outstanding indebtedness is credible and realistic. See Directive \u00b6 \nE2.2(a)(\u201cAvailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable \nand unfavorable, should be considered in reaching a determination.\u201d) There is no \nrequirement that a plan provide for payments on all outstanding debts simultaneously. \nRather, a reasonable plan (and concomitant conduct) may provide for the payment of \nsuch debts one at a time. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-25584 at 4 (App. Bd. Apr. 4, \n2008). In this case, Applicant does not earn enough money to pay more than one or two \ndebts at a time. \n \nOn balance, Applicant presented sufficient evidence to fully mitigate reliability \nand trustworthiness concerns arising from financial considerations, including her failure \nto pay or resolve all of her financial obligations since 2001. Overall, the record evidence \nleaves no doubt as to Applicant\u2019s present eligibility and suitability for a public trust \nposition. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n FOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.h:  \n For Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a public trust \nposition.  Eligibility for access to ADPI/II/III is granted. \n \n \n                                  \n \n          \n \n \n \n_________________ \nSHARI DAM \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Jeffreys, Esq., Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nMASON, Paul J., Administrative Judge:\nThe Statement of Reasons (SOR) lists four delinquent debts totaling $49,827.\nApplicant claimed that he started paying $1,100 a month in February 2008 into a debt\nconsolidation plan to satisfy the delinquent accounts identified in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, and 1.d, of\nthe SOR. However, because he lost his job, he was no longer enrolled in the plan.\nWithout any evidence of payments under the debt plan, e.g., cancelled checks,\nchecking account statements, or evidence of a debt plan, Applicant has not met his\nburden of showing that he qualifies for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to\nclassified information is denied. \nStatement of the Case\nApplicant signed and certified his Security Clearance Application (SCA, Item 5)\non November 18, 2008. He was interviewed by an investigator from the Office of\nPersonnel Management (OPM) on November 25, 2008. This interview appears in his\nInterrogatory Answers provided to the Government on March 19, 2010. In his\ninterrogatory answers submitted to the Government, Applicant agreed with the\nNovember 30, 2010\n\n It is also unclear from the record when and how many payments Applicant made to this creditor independent\n1\nof those payments he made into the debt consolidation plan. It is not clear from the record exactly which\ncreditors were in the debt plan.\n2\ninvestigator\u2019s summary of his November 2008 interview, and that it could be used in a\nsecurity clearance hearing to determine his security suitability. On June 9, 2010, DOHA\nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under financial\nconsiderations (Guideline F). The action was taken under Executive Order 10865,\nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended;\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the\nadjudicative guidelines (AG). \nApplicant furnished his answer to the SOR on June 18, 2010. A copy of the\nGovernment\u2019s File of Relevant Material (FORM, the Government\u2019s evidence in support\nof the allegations of the SOR) was sent to Applicant on August 2, 2010. He received the\nFORM on August 11, 2010. In an attachment to the FORM, Applicant was advised he\ncould object to the information in the FORM or submit additional information in\nexplanation or extenuation. His response was due on September 9, 2010. No response\nwas received. The case was assigned to me on October 25, 2010. \nFindings of Fact\nThe SOR contains four allegations under financial considerations (Guideline F).\nThe underlying accounts represent one loan, two credit cards, and security system\nmaintenance costs. Applicant admitted all allegations.\nApplicant is 50 years old. He married in June 2001, and divorced in November\n2006. He entered the United States Army in 1980, and was honorably discharged in\nFebruary 2000. He seeks a security clearance. \nInformation for the four delinquent debts listed in the SOR appears in Item 6\n(Interrogatory Answers, dated March 19, 2010), Item 7 (Interrogatory Answers, dated\nAugust 29, 2009), Item 8 (Interrogatory Answers, August 16, 2009), Item 9 (Credit\nBureau Report, April 2, 2010), Item 10 (Credit Bureau Report, April 24, 2009), and Item\n11 (Credit Bureau Report, November 18, 2008). The delinquent accounts shall be\ndiscussed in the order they are listed in the SOR.\nSOR 1.a, $16,566, credit union loan. The loan became delinquent in January\n2009. Applicant claimed the delinquent account was placed with two other debts into a\ndebt consolidation plan that he joined in February 2008. (Item 8)  In August 2009,\n1\nApplicant indicated he made his most recent payment leaving a balance of about\n$13,000. No documentation was provided to support Applicant\u2019s claims of payments\nindependent of or through the debt plan. \n\n Item 5 (SCA) reflects Applicant has had uninterrupted employment from 2001 to the present. Under Section\n2\n11 of Item 5, Applicant\u2019s employment is as follows: (1) a co-owner of a dental care business from October\n2001 to July 2005; (2) an analyst from July 2005 to November 2006; (3) an insurance consultant from\nDecember 2006 to December 2007; (4) an instructor from January 2008 to September 008; and, (4) a\nconsultant from October 2008 to the present. (Id., at 3)\n3\nSOR 1.b, $25,037, credit card. The account became delinquent in February\n2009. Applicant indicated he also placed this account in a debt consolidation plan that\nwas discontinued when he lost his employment.  He estimated his last payment on the\n2\ndebt into the debt plan was October 2008. (Item 8)\nSOR 1.c, $707, home security system. This account became delinquent in May\n2008. According to Applicant, he opened the account in September 2004. He and his\nwife used the service until their divorce in August 2006. In the divorce, she was\nawarded the house and the costs to maintain the house. Applicant cancelled the service\nat some time in 2008 after he lost his employment, and even though the SCA does not\nshow he was unemployed. He did not have plans to pay the debt because it was his\nformer wife\u2019s responsibility. (Item 6)\nSOR 1.d, $6,977, credit card. The account became delinquent in May 2006.\nApplicant recalled making a $120 payment to the creditor in September 2007, but\nsupplied no documentation verifying proof of payment. Applicant also indicated this debt\nwas in the debt plan that he joined in February 2008. (Item 6, Item 7) He estimated his\nlast payment on this debt was also in October 2008. \nCharacter Evidence\nApplicant joined the United States Army in February 1980. He obtained an\nhonorable discharge from the service in February 2000. During his service, he received\nsix military awards for his performance. He furnished no other character evidence from\nhis work or his community. \nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant's suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the AG. Each guideline lists potentially disqualifying\nconditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in evaluating an applicant's\neligibility for access to classified information.\nThe administrative judge's ultimate goal is to reach a fair and impartial decision\nthat is based on sound and prudent judgment. The decision should also include a\ncareful, thorough evaluation of a number of variables known as the \"whole-person\nconcept\" that brings together all available, reliable information about the person, past\nand present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. I have avoided drawing\ninferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. Decisions include, by\nnecessity, consideration of the possible risk the applicant may deliberately or\n\n4\ninadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a\ncertain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to the potential, rather than actual,\nrisk of compromise of classified information.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.l.14., the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.l.l5., the applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \"witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\" The\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision.\nAnalysis\nFinancial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set forth in AG \u00b6 18:\nFailure or inability to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. Compulsive\ngambling is a concern as it may lead to financial crimes including\nespionage. Affluence that cannot be explained by known sources of\nincome is also a security concern. It may indicate proceeds from\nfinancially profitable criminal acts.\nThe Government has the responsibility of presenting sufficient information to\nsupport all allegations of the SOR. Based on the credit reports (showing the delinquent\ndebts listed in the SOR), Applicant\u2019s interrogatory responses (including his November\n25, 2008 interview), and his answers to the SOR, the Government has presented\nsufficient information to establish all the allegations in the SOR. AG \u00b6 19(a) (inability or\nunwillingness to satisfy debts) and AG \u00b6 19(c) (a history of not meeting financial\nobligations) apply. AG \u00b6 19(a) applies based on Applicant inability to pay the delinquent\naccounts totaling approximately $48,800. The credit bureau reports establish that AG \u00b6\n19(c) applies because Applicant let four accounts fall delinquent between May 2006 and\nFebruary 2009. \nFour mitigating conditions are potentially applicable. No mitigation is available\nunder AG \u00b6 20(a) (the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred\nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the\nindividual's reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment). The four listed debts\nbecame delinquent between May 2006 and February 2009. The amount of delinquent\ndebt and the lack of documented action to address the debt forecasts the probability the\nfinancial delinquencies will persist in the foreseeable future. The likelihood of financial\n\n5\nproblems in the future without a strategy to eliminate the debt continues to cast a pall\nover Appellant\u2019s reliability and judgment. \nAG \u00b6 20(b) (the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely\nbeyond the person's control and the individual acted responsibly under the\ncircumstances). Based on the information Applicant provided about the loss of his job,\nthis unanticipated event would weigh in his favor under AG \u00b6 20(b) to explain why he\ncould not continue to pay his delinquent debts. However, his SCA shows he has been\nemployed consistently since 2001. Without more information, his unemployment claim is\nnot a credible reason for not paying the listed delinquent accounts. \nApplicant should receive credit for joining a debt consolidation plan to\ndemonstrate he acted responsibly after becoming unemployed. However, the credibility\nof his debt consolidation claim is substantially diminished by the lack of documentation\nof the plan\u2019s existence and of payments under the plan. The passage of time from the\nend of 2008 (after he claims he made his most recent payments to three of the listed\ncreditors) to June 9, 2010 (issuance of the SOR), without documented action to address\nhis delinquent accounts, results in no mitigation for Applicant under AG \u00b6 20(b).\nAG \u00b6 20(c) (the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control)\ndoes not apply. The record does not indicate Applicant had financial counseling. His\nenrollment in a debt plan in February 2008 indicates that he was concerned about his\ndelinquent debts, and initially took responsible action to pay the accounts in an\norganized manner. However, he furnished no evidence showing he paid into the plan or\nthat he paid any of the debts independent of the plan. Since there is no indication of\ncounseling or that the delinquent debts are under control, AG \u00b6 20(c) does not apply.\nApplicant receives no mitigation under AG \u00b6 20(d), (a good-faith effort to repay\noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts) because there is no documentation\nconfirming payments under the plan. After weighing and balancing the disqualifying\nevidence against the mitigating evidence under the financial guideline, Applicant has not\npresented sufficient favorable evidence to receive access to a security clearance. \nWhole-Person Concept \nI have examined the evidence under the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in\nmy ultimate finding against Applicant under the financial considerations guideline. I have\nalso weighed the circumstances within the context of nine variables known as the\nwhole-person concept. In evaluating the relevance of an individual's conduct, the\nadministrative judge should consider the following factors listed in AG \u00b6 2(a):\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct;\n(2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation;\n\n6\n(3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; \n(4) the individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; \n(5) the extent to which the participation was voluntary;\n(6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent\nbehavioral changes;\n(7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and\n(9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nApplicant is 50 years old. He had a successful 20-year career in the United\nStates Army. He received six prestigious awards for laudable military service in the field\nof information technology. \nThe credit bureau reports indicate that Applicant began having financial problems\nin May 2006 when the first listed debt became delinquent. After his divorce in\nSeptember 2006, three additional debts became delinquent by February 2009. To\nsubstantiate his enrollment in the debt plan and/or payments to the plan, Applicant\ncould have provided documentation. For some reason, he decided not to, even though\nhe had a chance to explain his positions after he received the FORM. Since the end of\n2008, Applicant could have tried another strategy, including a Chapter 7 bankruptcy, to\neliminate his debts. He could have tried a Chapter 13 bankruptcy to bring his delinquent\ndebts under control. Instead, the record shows the only action taken was to cancel the\nsecurity system contract. Without a plan to address the debts, the chances are that\nApplicant\u2019s current financial problems will continue in the future. See AG \u00b6 2(a)(1)\nthrough AG \u00b6 2(a)(9). The financial guideline is resolved against Applicant.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1 (Guideline F):\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a through 1.d \nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\n\n7\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n                      \nPaul J. Mason\nAdministrative Judge\n",

After a thorough review of the evidence, I make the following additional findings of fact. Background Information Applicant is a 56-year-old tool room machinist, who has worked for a defense contractor employer since November 1982. His employer has changed hands several times since 1982; however, Applicant has remained in the same location. He is a first- time applicant for a security clearance. (GE 1, Tr. 16-19, 27-28.) Applicant graduated from high school in May 1971. He attended a community college from September 1996 to May 2000, and estimates that he has earned 15 credit hours. Applicant has also attended various job-related courses throughout his working career. He did not serve in the armed forces. (GE 1, Tr. 22-24.) Applicant married in June 1984, and has been separated from his wife since July 2008. They have three children, a 26-year-old daughter, a 23-year-old son, and an 18-year-old son.

Clearance is granted. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn September 15, 2008, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for \nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP). On August 27, 2009, the Defense Office of \nHearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing \nsecurity concerns under Guideline F (financial considerations) for Applicant. The \naction was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information \nwithin Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) effective within \nthe Department of Defense for SORs after September 1, 2006.  \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on November 3, 2009, and DOHA received his \nanswer on November 9, 2009. Department Counsel was prepared to proceed on April \nAugust 31, 2010\n\n \n2 \n \n \n15, 2010. The case was assigned to me on May 5, 2010. DOHA issued a notice of \nhearing on May 6, 2010, scheduling the hearing for May 19, 2010. The hearing was \nheld as scheduled. \n \nThe Government offered Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 7, which were \nreceived without objection. The Applicant offered Applicant Exhibits (AE) A and B, \nwhich were received without objection, and he testified on his own behalf.  \n \nI held the record open until May 28, 2010, to afford the Applicant the \nopportunity to submit additional documents on his behalf. Applicant timely submitted \nAE C and D, which were received without objection. DOHA received the hearing \ntranscript (Tr.) on May 26, 2010. The record closed on May 28, 2010. \n \nProcedural Rulings \n \nAmendment of SOR \n \n \nDepartment Counsel moved to amend SOR \u00b6 1.a. to correct Applicant\u2019s \nChapter 7 discharge date from \u201c2206\u201d to \u201c2006.\u201d Without objection from the Applicant, \nI granted Department Counsel\u2019s request. (Tr. 33-34.) \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant admitted all of the SOR allegations. His admissions are incorporated \nas findings of fact. After a thorough review of the evidence, I make the following \nadditional findings of fact. \n \nBackground Information \n \nApplicant is a 56-year-old tool room machinist, who has worked for a defense \ncontractor employer since November 1982. His employer has changed hands several \ntimes since 1982; however, Applicant has remained in the same location. He is a first-\ntime applicant for a security clearance. (GE 1, Tr. 16-19, 27-28.)  \n \nApplicant graduated from high school in May 1971. He attended a community \ncollege from September 1996 to May 2000, and estimates that he has earned 15 \ncredit hours. Applicant has also attended various job-related courses throughout his \nworking career. He did not serve in the armed forces. (GE 1, Tr. 22-24.) \n \nApplicant married in June 1984, and has been separated from his wife since \nJuly 2008. They have three children, a 26-year-old daughter, a 23-year-old son, and \nan 18-year-old son. At the time of hearing, Applicant\u2019s daughter was living with her \nmother, and his two sons were living with family members. Applicant does not pay \nspousal or child support. His wife is employed as a nurse. (GE 1, Tr. 21-22, 28-30.)  \n \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \nFinancial Considerations \n \nApplicant\u2019s background investigation addressed his financial situation and \nincluded the review of his September 2008 e-QIP; his April 2009 responses to DOHA \nInterrogatories; his October 2005 Chapter 7 Bankruptcy petition; his February 2006 \nChapter 7 Bankruptcy discharge; as well as his September 2008, February 2009, and \nDecember 2009 credit reports. Applicant\u2019s SOR alleges a 2006 Chapter 7 Bankruptcy \nand three separate collection accounts totaling $11,534. (GE 1 \u2013 7; SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. \u2013 \n1.d.) \n \nApplicant and his wife filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy in October 2005 and were \nawarded a discharge in February 2006. The total amount of debts discharged on their \nSchedule F (Creditors Holding Unsecured Nonpriority Claims) was $58,503. Applicant \nstated the reason he and his wife were forced to file bankruptcy was due to his wife\u2019s \n\u201ccasino gambling habit.\u201d Her gambling habit had been ongoing for approximately 12 \nyears and led to the deterioration of their marriage. (GE 6, GE 7, Tr. 30-33, 47-48, 51; \nSOR \u00b6 1.a.) \n \nThe remaining three debts are collection accounts for credit cards. Applicant \ntestified that two of the accounts are joint accounts and the third account was opened \nwithout his knowledge by his estranged wife before they separated. Applicant \nattributes these collection accounts to his wife\u2019s indiscriminate spending, but \nrecognizes his obligation to make good on them. He estimates that he fell behind on \nthese debts at the time he and his wife separated in 2008. (AE A, Tr. 35-36, 46, 50-\n52.) \n \nIn May 2010, Applicant retained the services of a debt consolidation firm (DCF). \nApplicant enrolled his three SOR debts with the DCF. Applicant has been making \nmonthly payments to the DCF since May 2010 in the amount of $287 per month by \ndirect debit. His three SOR debts are being monitored and paid by the DCF. (AE B, \nAE D, Tr. 36-40.) \n \nIn conclusion, Applicant has made good-faith efforts to repay or resolve the \nthree debts alleged. Applicant remains current on the rest of his monthly bills. His \nbudget reflects a monthly remainder and demonstrates that he maintains a modest \nlifestyle and is living within his means. (GE 4, Tr. 40-47.) \n \nCharacter Evidence \n \nApplicant submitted a reference letter from a senior company manager. The \nmanager stated that Applicant worked on and off for him for over 20 years in various \npositions. He stated that Applicant has shown an outstanding work ethic and a positive \nattitude in everything he does. Applicant is conscientious and has always been willing \nto work late and come in early. He concluded, \u201cFor all the years [Applicant] has \nworked for me I have never heard him say a negative thing about anyone. If all my \nemployees were like [Applicant], my life would be a whole lot easier.\u201d (AE C.) \n\n \n4 \n \n \nPolicies \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory \nexplanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying \nconditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s \neligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 \n2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion in seeking a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration \nof the possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \nAnalysis \n \n  \nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all \nappropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, including those described briefly \nabove, I conclude that a relevant security concern exists under Guideline F (financial \nconsiderations). AG \u00b6 18 articulates the security concern relating to financial \nproblems: \n \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds. \n  \n \nAG \u00b6 19 provides two financial considerations disqualifying conditions that \ncould raise a security concern and may be disqualifying in this case: \u201c(a) inability or \nunwillingness to satisfy debts,\u201d and \u201c(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d \nApplicant\u2019s history of delinquent debt is established by his admissions and the \nevidence presented. As indicated in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. to 1.d., he filed for bankruptcy in \n2005 and more recently accumulated three debts totaling $11,534 that were in various \nstates of delinquency for several years. The Government established the disqualifying \nconditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c).   \n \n  \nFive financial considerations mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a) through \n(e) are potentially applicable:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), \nand \nthe \nindividual \nacted \nresponsibly \nunder \nthe \ncircumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control; \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; and \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \n                                                          \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \nApplicant\u2019s conduct does not warrant full application of AG \u00b6 20(a) because \nthere is more than one delinquent debt and his financial problems are not isolated. \nThree debts remain unpaid. Therefore, his debt is \u201ca continuing course of conduct.\u201d \nSee ISCR Case No. 07-11814 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 29, 2008) (citing ISCR Case No. \n01-03695 (App. Bd. Oct. 16, 2002)). He receives partial credit under AG \u00b6 20(a) \nbecause the debt \u201coccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment.\u201d  \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 20(b), Applicant receives credit because his indebtedness stems \nfrom his estranged wife\u2019s gambling problems, which are largely beyond his control. \nApplicant took the drastic step of filing Chapter 7 bankruptcy hoping his indebtedness \nwas behind him. Applicant\u2019s wife continued to gamble and engage in indiscriminate \nspending. Her behavior led to the deterioration of their marriage. They are currently \nseparated with a divorce pending.1  \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c) is not applicable because Applicant did not produce evidence of \nfinancial counseling. However, he has produced evidence that establishes that he is \nliving within his means and has regained has financial responsibility. Furthermore, \nthere is sufficient information to establish full mitigation under AG \u00b6 20(d).2 Applicant \nis making a good-faith effort to pay or otherwise resolve his debts. AG \u00b6 20(e) is not \napplicable because Applicant did not dispute the legitimacy of any of his debts. His \n \n1\u201cEven if Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances outside \nhis [or her] control, the Judge could still consider whether Applicant has since acted in a reasonable \nmanner when dealing with those financial difficulties.\u201d ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. Bd. Jan. \n12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 at 4 \n(App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). A component is \nwhether he maintained contact with his creditors and attempted to negotiate partial payments to keep \nhis debts current. \n \n2The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a \u201cgood-faith\u201d effort to repay overdue \ncreditors or otherwise resolve debts: \n \nIn order to qualify for application of [the \u201cgood-faith\u201d mitigating condition], an applicant \nmust present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \nsome other good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant\u2019s debts. The Directive \ndoes not define the term \u2018good-faith.\u2019 However, the Board has indicated that the \nconcept of good-faith \u2018requires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows \nreasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.\u2019 Accordingly, \nan applicant must do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally available \noption in order to claim the benefit of [the \u201cgood-faith\u201d mitigating condition].  \n \n(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2004) (quoting \nISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 4, 2001)). \n\n \n7 \n \n \n2005 Chapter 7 Bankruptcy filing lacks security significance both because of the \npassage of time, and because it followed the financial fallout incurred as a result of his \nwife\u2019s gambling habits. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the \napplicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should \nconsider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the \nmotivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, \nexploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence.  \nThe ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance must \nbe an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nguidelines and the whole-person concept. AG \u00b6 2(c).  \nThere is evidence against mitigating Applicant\u2019s conduct. The SOR lists a 2005 \nChapter 7 bankruptcy and three debts totalling $11,534 that were at one time or \nanother in various states of delinquency. He failed to keep his accounts current, \nshowing financial irresponsibility and lack of judgment. This fact alone raises sufficient \nsecurity concerns to merit further inquiry.   \n \nThe mitigating evidence under the whole-person concept is more substantial. \nApplicant\u2019s record of good employment weighs in his favor. He has accumulated 28 \nyears of faithful and loyal service in the defense industry. Applicant is a law-abiding \ncitizen. He has made a good-faith effort to pay or resolve his SOR debts. He \nrecognized he had a problem with his debts, retained the services of a DCF in May \n2010, and is making monthly payments to his DCF by direct debit. His monthly \nexpenses are current. The Appeal Board has addressed a key element in the whole-\nperson analysis in financial cases, stating: \n \nIn evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the \nconcept of \u201c\u2018meaningful track record\u2019\u201d necessarily includes evidence of \nactual debt reduction through payment of debts.\u201d However, an applicant \nis not required, as a matter of law, to establish that he has paid off each \nand every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an applicant \ndemonstrate that he has \u201c. . . established a plan to resolve his financial \n\n \n8 \n \n \nproblems and taken significant actions to implement that plan.\u201d The \nJudge can reasonably consider the entirety of an applicant\u2019s financial \nsituation and his actions in evaluating the extent to which that applicant\u2019s \nplan for the reduction of his outstanding indebtedness is credible and \nrealistic. See Directive \u00b6  E2.2(a) (\u201cAvailable, reliable information about \nthe person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be \nconsidered in reaching a determination.\u201d) There is no requirement that a \nplan provide for payments on all outstanding debts simultaneously. \nRather, a reasonable plan (and concomitant conduct) may provide for \nthe payment of such debts one at a time. Likewise, there is no \nrequirement that the first debts actually paid in furtherance of a \nreasonable debt plan be the ones listed in the SOR. \n \nISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008) (internal citations omitted). \nApplicant is making a significant contribution to the national defense. His company \nfully supports him and recommends him for a security clearance. He made mistakes, \nand debts became delinquent. There is, however, simply no reason not to trust him. \nHe is paying down his debts. Furthermore, he has established a \u201cmeaningful track \nrecord\u201d of debt payments. These factors show responsibility, rehabilitation, and \nmitigation. After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, and all the facts \nand circumstances in the context of the whole person, I conclude he has mitigated the \nfinancial considerations security concerns.  \n \nI take this position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. \nEgan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988), my careful consideration of the whole person factors and \nsupporting evidence, my application of the pertinent factors under the adjudicative \nprocess, and my interpretation of my responsibilities under the adjudicative guidelines. \nApplicant has fully mitigated or overcome the Government\u2019s case. For the reasons \nstated, I conclude he is eligible for access to classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the \nSOR, as required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:   \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a. to 1.d.: \n For Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n9 \n \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility \nfor a security clearance.

Applicant requested a hearing.  On February 26, 2010, after the hearing,\nAdministrative Judge Joan Caton Anthony denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.\nApplicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge was biased against\nApplicant; whether the Judge failed properly to apply the whole-person factors; and whether the\nJudge\u2019s adverse security clearance decision was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  Finding\nno error, we affirm.  \nThe Judge\u2019s findings include the following: Applicant is a field engineer for a federal\ncontractor.  He has held a security clearance since 1994.  He served in the U.S. military for 13 years\nand is currently in the reserves.\nApplicant divorced his wife in 2004.  After the divorce, he bought a house, acquiring a\nhousemate, whose rental payments would offset some of the cost of his mortgage payment.\nApplicant also permitted other persons to stay at his house.  He had a personal computer, to which\nthe other persons staying there had access.  In October 2005, law enforcement agents searched\nApplicant\u2019s house and seized his computer.  The following July Applicant was arrested and charged\nwith 20 counts of possession of child pornography  and with possession both of marijuana and\n1\nmarijuana paraphernalia.  \nThe 20 counts of child pornography possession were subsequently merged into 11, and the\nmarijuana charges were dropped.  Applicant pled not guilty, and, \u201crepresented by an attorney with\na national reputation for defending against child pornography charges,\u201d he fully litigated the\nprosecution\u2019s case against him.  Decision at 4.  He was found guilty on all 11 counts, sentenced to\na year of prison for each count, all suspended; fined $100 for each count; placed on supervised\nprobation for 3 years; and ordered to receive psychiatric treatment.  \nApplicant contends that the Judge was biased against him.  In his brief, he states that the\nJudge \u201callowed the prejudicial nature of the underlying crime to cloud her eyes regarding the\nconsiderable favorable evidence expressed.  Thus, undue weight was given to the isolated incident\nof criminal/sexual misconduct.\u201d  Applicant\u2019s Brief at 11.  There is a rebuttable presumption that a\nJudge is impartial and unbiased, and a party seeking to overcome that presumption has a heavy\nburden of persuasion.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 07- 02253 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 28, 2008); ISCR Case\nNo. 02-08032 at 4 (App. Bd. May 14, 2004).  The Board has examined Applicant\u2019s contention in\nlight of the record as a whole.  Beyond the conclusory statement quoted above, Applicant points to\nnothing in the Judge\u2019s handling of his case that would cause a reasonable person to question her\nimpartiality.  We find no basis to conclude that the Judge was predisposed against Applicant or that\n\n3\nshe exhibited other indicia of a lack of impartiality.  ISCR Case No. 08-01306 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct.\n28, 2009).  We conclude that Applicant has failed to rebut the presumption that the Judge was\nimpartial.  Neither has Applicant demonstrated that the Judge weighed the evidence in a manner that\nwas arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-21819 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug.\n13, 2009). \nIn support of his appeal, Applicant cites to cases decided by the DOHA Hearing Office\nwhich, he contends, support his argument for mitigation.  We give due consideration to these cases.\nHowever, each case \u201cmust be decided upon its own merits.\u201d  Directive \u00b6 E2.2.3.  The cases cited by\nApplicant are factually distinct from his in significant ways.  Moreover, one of the cases he cites was\nactually reversed on appeal.  In any event, Hearing Office decisions are binding neither on other\nHearing Office Judges nor on the Board.  See ISCR Case No. 06-24121 at 2 (App. Bd. Feb. 5, 2008).\nAfter reviewing the record, the Board concludes that the Judge examined the relevant data\nand articulated a satisfactory explanation for the decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between\nthe facts found and the choice made,\u2019\u201d both as to the mitigating conditions and the whole-person\nfactors.  See Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n of the United States v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463\nU.S. 29, 43 (1983)(quoting Burlington Truck Lines, Inc. v. United States, 371 U.S. 156, 168 (1962)).\nThe Judge\u2019s adverse decision is sustainable on this record.  \u201cThe general standard is that a clearance\nmay be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests of the national security.\u2019\u201d\nDepartment of the Navy v.

His eligibility for a security clearance is \ndenied. \n \nApplicant executed an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-\nQIP) on May 25, 2007. On September 9, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals (DOHA) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security \nconcerns under Guideline J, Criminal Conduct, and Guideline D, Sexual Behavior. The \naction was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information \nwithin Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) \npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the \nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nOn September 15, 2009, Applicant answered the SOR and elected to have a \nhearing before an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on December 7, \nFebruary 26, 2010\n\n \n2 \n \n \n2009. I convened a hearing on January 27, 2010, to consider whether it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for \nApplicant. The Government called no witnesses and introduced ten exhibits, which were \nmarked Ex. 1 through 10 and admitted to the record without objection.  Applicant \ntestified on his own behalf and called three witnesses. He offered 20 exhibits, which \nwere marked Ex. A through T and admitted to the record without objection. DOHA \nreceived the transcript (Tr.) of the hearing on February 4, 2010. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nThe SOR contains two allegations of disqualifying conduct under AG J, Criminal \nConduct (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. and 1.b.) and one allegation of disqualifying conduct under AG D, \nSexual Behavior (SOR \u00b6 2.a.). In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted one AG J \nallegation. He denied one AG J allegation, and he denied the AG D allegation. He also \nprovided additional information. Applicant\u2019s admission is admitted herein as a finding of \nfact. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, I make the \nfollowing additional findings of fact. (Answer to SOR; Ex. 5; Ex, 6; Tr. 75, 82-86.)  \n \n \nApplicant, who is 44 years old and employed as a field engineer by a federal \ncontractor, has held a security clearance since 1994. He served on active duty in the \nU.S. military for 13 years. He currently serves in a military reserve unit as a senior \nnoncommissioned officer. (Ex. 1; Tr. 74.) \n \n  \nApplicant\u2019s mother was in high school when he was born. He never met or had \nany contact with his birth father. When he was three years old, his mother married a \nman who later adopted Applicant. Applicant\u2019s stepfather was an alcoholic, and he \nwithdrew from contact with family members when he drank. Applicant\u2019s younger brother \nis an alcoholic. Applicant was arrested for driving under the influence of alcohol (DUI) in \n1988 and 1991. Approximately 15 years ago, he resolved to drink alcohol in moderation, \nwhich he apparently does. He has had no other alcohol-related arrests. (Ex. 1; Ex. R at \n2; Ex. 9 at 5) \n \n \nApplicant attended a university for one semester on a football scholarship. He \nlater attended another college for two years but had to drop out for lack of money. He \nhoped to acquire more education when he joined the military. At present he is pursuing \nstudies leading to a Bachelor of Arts degree in Paralegal Studies. He expects to \ncomplete his course work for the degree in June 2010. (Ex. Q at 3; Ex. R at 2-3.) \n \n \nApplicant married in 1994. One child was born to the marriage, a son who is now \n15. The marriage was difficult and stressful. Applicant\u2019s wife experienced severe mood \nswings and was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. While Applicant and his family were \nliving overseas on an assignment, his wife became distraught and stabbed him with a \nbutcher knife. Applicant and his wife divorced in 2004. (Ex. 1; Ex. 9 at 2-3; Ex. R at 3.) \n \n \nIn 2002, while he was assigned to active duty, Applicant was playing recreational \nbasketball with individuals in his command. During a basketball game, Applicant ran into  \n\n \n3 \n \n \nanother player, causing him to fall, get hurt, and break his glasses. Applicant considered \nthe event to be an accident. He apologized to the other player and offered to pay to \nreplace his glasses. About three months later, Applicant was sent to nonjudical \npunishment for the offense of aggravated assault. Because he did not believe himself \nguilty of the charge, Applicant declined the nonjudicial punishment and requested a \ncourt-martial. After an investigation, the court-martial prosecutor and Applicant\u2019s military \ndefense counsel agreed that the court-martial charge would be dismissed, provided \nApplicant paid the other player\u2019s medical expenses of $300, replaced his damaged \ntraining gear and basketball clothing, and wrote a letter of apology. Applicant complied, \nand the charge was dismissed. The SOR alleged at \u00b6 1.b. that Applicant\u2019s encounter \nwith the other player on the basketball court resulted in a court-martial for aggravated \nassault.  (SOR; Tr. 28-30, 82-84.) \n \n \nAfter his divorce in 2004, Applicant purchased a house. He moved into the house \nat the end of July 2004. To meet his monthly mortgage payments of $1,300, Applicant \nacquired a housemate, an individual he had met, befriended, and mentored while \nserving in the military in 2003. He charged the individual $500 a month in rent, and the \nindividual occupied the second floor on his house, which was comprised of two \nbedrooms and a bathroom. The tenant also was permitted to have access to and use of \nthe living room, kitchen, and laundry room on the first floor of the house.  (Tr. 111-115.)    \n \n \nDuring this time, Applicant was traveling for extended periods in his work as a \ncivilian contractor. In addition to the housemate, Applicant also invited other friends and \ncoworkers to stay at his house when they had a need to do so or were on military \nassignments. Applicant\u2019s girlfriend and the housemate\u2019s girlfriend also stayed at the \nhouse intermittently. The housemate and at least one other person who stayed at the \nhouse had access to Applicant\u2019s personal computer, which was in a central location in \nthe house. These individuals used the computer regularly.  (Tr. 54-58, 75, 87-88, 113-\n115.) \n \n \nOne of Applicant\u2019s witnesses testified that he used Applicant\u2019s computer \noccasionally between May 2003 and June 2006. This witness also stated that he \nresided temporarily in Applicant\u2019s house approximately every two weeks when he was \non military assignment. When he was residing in Applicant\u2019s house, he saw Applicant \nand the housemate access Applicant\u2019s computer to view adult pornography. (Tr. 56-58.) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s housemate had an argument with a girlfriend and damaged a wall in \none of the rooms he occupied in the house. Applicant asked the housemate to pay for \nthe repair of the wall, and he agreed to do so. However, when the housemate moved \nout of Applicant\u2019s house in July 2005, he owed some back rent and had not provided for \nthe repair of the wall he had damaged. In an effort to pressure the housemate to pay the \nrent arrearages and the wall damage, Applicant threatened to tell the housemate\u2019s \ncommand about the housemate\u2019s failure to honor his financial obligations. Applicant \ncould not remember if the housemate retained a key to the house or if he had given him \na key for access after he moved out. (Ex. 9 at 6-7; Tr. 91-93, 103-104.) \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \n                                           \n \nAt about the same time, Applicant noticed that his computer was running slowly.1 \nHe concluded that his housemate had downloaded material onto the computer that \nslowed its operation. Applicant then went into the computer\u2019s file system, identified \nmaterial that he thought had slowed down the system, and copied it to several CDs. He \nstored the CDs in binders in his home. He then deleted the files he had copied from his \nhard drive. He notified the housemate that he had the CDs and would return them and \nother personal items to the housemate when he either repaired the damage to the wall \nor paid him for the repair.2 (Ex.9 at 7; Ex. 10 at 2; Tr. 99-104, 116-17.) \n \n \nIn October 2005, while Applicant was on a work assignment in another state, law  \nenforcement officials obtained a search warrant, searched his residence, and \nconfiscated his computer, the CDs containing the files he had copied from his computer, \nmarijuana, and marijuana paraphernalia. Applicant\u2019s girlfriend visited the premises after \nthe search warrant had been executed, and she called him and told him of the search. \nEx. 9 at 7-8; Ex. 10 at 3.) \n \n \nIn July 2006, Applicant was arrested and charged with 20 counts of possession \nof child pornography, possession of marijuana, and possession of marijuana \nparaphernalia.3 Applicant believed that the housemate provided information to \ninvestigators which led to the search of his property, his arrest, and the charges against \nhim of possession of child pornography. He further speculated that the housemate \nintended to harm him by informing investigators that child pornography CD files in \nApplicant\u2019s residence belonged to Applicant when they had been downloaded onto \nApplicant\u2019s computer and viewed by the housemate.  (Ex. R at 3; Ex. 10 at 1; Tr. 89.) \n \n \nApplicant went to trial on the charges in March 2007. At trial, the 20 counts of \nmisdemeanor possession of child pornography were merged into 11 counts, to which \nApplicant pled not guilty on each count. He was represented by an attorney with a \nnational reputation for defending against child pornography charges. The matter was \n \n1 One of Applicant\u2019s witnesses was an individual who also resided periodically in Applicant\u2019s home and \nused his computer during the time that Applicant and the housemate also used the computer. He testified \nthat he did not find that the computer was \u201cfull\u201d of files or slow to respond. (Tr. 58.)  \n \n2 Applicant also testified that the housemate left a number of items in the house when he moved out. One \nof the items was a CD wallet that held about 100 CDs. Applicant stated that the housemate\u2019s CD wallet \nwas stored in the back of a closet in the computer room of his residence. In his affidavit, Applicant stated \nthat he put the CDs containing the material he downloaded from his computer into binders. He stated he \nneither attempted to identify the material he downloaded, nor was he certain that the material he was \ndownloading had been placed on his computer by the housemate. (Ex. 10 at 2; Tr. 78, 100, 114-115.)   \n \n3 The marijuana possession and possession of marijuana paraphernalia charges against Applicant were \nnolle prosequi. Applicant\u2019s girlfriend, who later became his wife, admitted that the marijuana and \nmarijuana paraphernalia found in Applicant\u2019s residence were hers. Because these were first offenses for \nher, the charges were placed on the state court\u2019s stet docket and eventually dropped. (Ex. 9 at 8; Tr. 104-\n105.) \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \n                                           \nfully litigated.4 The trial court found Applicant guilty on all 11 counts. He was sentenced \nto one year in prison for each count, all suspended; fined $100 for each count; placed \non supervised probation for three years; and ordered to attend psychiatric/psychological \nevaluation and/or treatment. Applicant\u2019s supervised probation will end in March 2010. \n(Ex. 9 at 6-8; Ex. 10 at 2-3; Tr. 75-76.) \n \n \nOn March 31, 2007, Applicant received a psychosocial evaluation from a \nlicensed clinical social worker who concluded that Applicant was not in need of sex \noffender counseling. The social worker advised that probation monitoring was the \nappropriate level of care for him. In January 2010, Applicant was evaluated by a \nlicensed clinical psychologist, who concluded that he was not suffering from a paraphilic \ndisorder and was unlikely to engage in child pornographic activities. (Ex. J; Ex. R; Ex. \nS.) \n \n \nApplicant submitted a signed statement of intent, dated January 27, 2009.5 The \nstatement of intent reads:  \n \n1. I am submitting this statement of intent concerning child pornography. \n \n2. Should there be any finding of my use or viewing of child pornography, I \nhereby consent to automatic revocation of my security clearance. \n \n(Ex. T.) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s family members, friends, coworkers and supervisors regard him with \nadmiration and respect. They consider him to be professional, effective in his work, \nresponsible, and reliable.  (Ex. A through Ex. I; Ex. L through Ex. P.) \n \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the \nExecutive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security, and \nit has emphasized that \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the \nNavy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the \nauthority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine \nwhether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. \nat 527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.  \n   \n \n4At trial, Applicant followed his attorney\u2019s advice regarding defense strategies. (Tr. 119-120.)  \n \n5The date on the statement of intent appears to be a typographical error. Applicant testified about the \nstatement of intent at his hearing on January 27, 2010, and it appears from the record that the statement \nof intent was actually signed on January 27, 2010 and not on January 27, 2009. (Ex. T; Tr. 13, 85-86.)  \n\n \n6 \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, an  \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, the administrative judge applies these guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion in seeking a favorable security decision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \n \n \n \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \n                                           \nAnalysis \n \n \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct \n \n \n \nUnder the Criminal Conduct guideline \u201c[c]riminal activity creates doubt about a \nperson\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness.  By its very nature, it calls into \nquestion a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations.\u201d  \nAG \u00b6 30. \n \n \n \nIn July 2006, Applicant was arrested and charged with 20 counts of possession \nof child pornography. At trial, Applicant was represented by counsel and pled not guilty \nto the charges. In March 2007, he was convicted of 11 merged counts of misdemeanor \npossession of child pornography and sentenced to one year of prison time for each \nconviction. His sentences were suspended, and he was given three years of supervised \nprobation and paid a fine. His supervised probation will end in March 2010. In his \nanswer to the SOR and at his hearing, Applicant denied the possession of child \npornography charges that led to his conviction. \n \n \n \nAs a general rule, an applicant convicted of a criminal offense is precluded from \ndenying his or her guilt in subsequent civil proceedings. DISCR Case No. 94-1213 at 3 \n(App. Bd. June 7, 1996.) This concept, known as collateral estoppel, is based on the \npremise that an individual\u2019s right to administrative due process does not give him or her \nthe right to litigate again matters properly adjudicated in an earlier proceeding. Chisholm \nv. Defense Logistics Agency, 656 F. 2d 42, 46 (3rd Cir. 1981). \n \n \n \nDOHA\u2019s Appeal Board has held that the doctrine of collateral estoppel applies in \nindustrial security cases. Moreover, the Appeal Board has ruled repeatedly that an \nadministrative judge may not engage in a de novo review of an applicant\u2019s guilt or \ninnocence of a criminal charge of which he or she was convicted in a criminal court. \nISCR Case No. 99-0116 at 2 (App. Bd. May 1, 2000); ISCR Case No. 96-0525 at 4 \n(App. Bd. June 17, 1997); ISCR Case No. 94-1213 (App. Bd. June 7, 1996). \n \n \n \nApplicant was convicted of 11 misdemeanor charges in a state court. The United \nStates Supreme Court has held that 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1738 requires federal courts to apply \nthe doctrine of collateral estoppel to state court judgments whenever the courts of the \nstate from which the judgment was rendered would do so.6 However, several federal \ncircuits have held that while the language of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1738 applies to federal courts, \nit does not apply to quasi-judicial determinations of federal executive branch agencies. \nIn ISCR Case No. 04-05712 (App. Bd. Oct. 31, 2006), the Appeal Board addressed the \napplicability of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1738 in cases where an applicant\u2019s case involves a state \ncourt misdemeanor conviction. The Appeal Board relied on federal case law in \nproposing the following three-part analysis to determine the appropriateness of applying \ncollateral estoppel in such cases:  \n \n6 Marrese v. American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons, 460 U.S. 373, 380 (1985); \nHaring v. Prosise, 462 U.S. 306, 313 (1983). \n\n \n8 \n \n \nFirst, the party against whom the earlier decision is asserted must have \nbeen afforded a \u2018full and fair opportunity\u2019 to litigate that issue in the earlier \ncase. (citations omitted.) Second, the issues presented for collateral \nestoppel must be the same as those resolved against the opposing party \nin the first trial. (citations omitted.) Collateral estoppel extends only to \nquestions \u2018distinctly put in issue and directly determined\u2019 in the criminal \nprosecution. (citations omitted.) Third, the application of collateral estoppel \nin the second hearing must not result in unfairness. (citations omitted.) \nFederal courts decline to apply collateral estoppel where the \ncircumstances indicate a lack of incentive to litigate the original matter. \n\u2018Preclusion is sometimes unfair if the party to be bound lacked an \nincentive to litigate the first trial, especially in comparison to the stakes of \nthe second trial.\u2019 (citations omitted. ) The arguments for not giving \npreclusive effect to misdemeanor convictions are that an individual may \nnot have the incentive to fully litigate a misdemeanor offense because \nthere is so much less at stake, or that plea bargains create an actual \ndisincentive to litigate these particular issues. (Citations omitted.)   \n \n(ISCR Case No. 04-05712 at 6 (App. Bd. Oct. 31, 2006.)  \n \n \nConsidering these legal concepts, we turn now to the criminal conduct \nallegations in the SOR. In October 2005, authorized law enforcement officials obtained \na search warrant and executed a search of Applicant\u2019s residence. In July 2006, \nApplicant was arrested and charged with 20 counts of possession of child pornography. \nAs his legal representative, he retained an attorney who specialized in defending \nindividuals charged with possession of child pornography. He was tried on 20 counts of \nchild pornography possession in March 2007. At his trial, he pled not guilty to all \ncharges. He was convicted on 11 merged counts, sentenced, fined, and given three \nyears of supervised probation. At his DOHA hearing, Applicant denied guilt for the \ncharges of which he was convicted.  \n \n \nIt is necessary to determine whether application of the collateral estoppel rule is \nappropriate in this case. The first element of the test is whether Applicant had a full and \nfair opportunity to litigate his case in the state court. He was charged with 20 \nmisdemeanor offenses of child pornography possession, and those offenses were \nmerged into 11 offenses at trial. Applicant was represented by counsel and had \nadequate time to prepare his defense. He pled not guilty to all charges and was found \nguilty by the court. I find the first part of the test is satisfied. \n \n \nThe second part of the test considers whether the criminal conviction covered the \nsame facts the government sought to establish in his DOHA hearing. The SOR alleged, \nunder Guideline J and Guideline D, that Applicant\u2019s conviction of 11 counts of \npossession of child pornography raised security concerns. These were the same 11 \ncounts that were litigated in Applicant\u2019s state court criminal trial. I find the second part of \nthe test is satisfied.  \n \n\n \n9 \n \n \n \nThe third part of the test considers whether application of collateral estoppel \nwould result in unfairness to Applicant. The record establishes that Applicant retained \nan attorney who was highly skilled in defending those charged with child pornography \npossession. Applicant entered into no pre-trial agreements or concessions, but pled not \nguilty and the matter was litigated fully. I conclude that the third part of the test meets \nthe criteria for the application of collateral estoppel.    \n \n \nThe conclusion that it is appropriate to apply collateral estoppel does not end the \ninquiry, however. It is necessary to review the substantive evidence to determine \nwhether the government\u2019s evidence raises security concerns, and whether Applicant \nmet his burden of persuasion in overcoming the government\u2019s evidence and \nestablishing that it is in the best interest of the United States that he be granted a \nsecurity clearance.  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s criminal history, as alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. and 1.b., raises concerns \nunder AG \u00b6 31(a), AG \u00b6 31(c), and 31(d) of the criminal conduct adjudicative guideline. \nAG \u00b6 31(a) reads: \u201ca single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses.\u201d AG \u00b6 31(c) reads: \n\u201callegation or admission or criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was \nformally charged, formally prosecuted or convicted.\u201d AG \u00b6 31(d) reads: \u201cindividual is \ncurrently on parole or probation.\u201d \n \n \n \nThree Criminal Conduct mitigating conditions might apply to Applicant\u2019s case.  If \n\u201cso much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it happened under \nsuch unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment,\u201d AG \u00b6 32(a) might apply. If \nthere is \u201cevidence that the person did not commit the offense,\u201d then AG \u00b6 32(c) might \napply.  If \u201cthere is evidence of successful rehabilitation, including but not limited to the \npassage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or restitution, job \ntraining or higher education, good employment record, or constructive involvement,\u201d \nthen AG \u00b6 32(d) might apply. \n \n \n \nThe record fails to establish that a court-martial determined that Applicant \ncommitted intentional aggravated assault on the service member he charged into on the \nbasketball court in 2002. I conclude that AG \u00b6 32(c) applies in mitigation to the facts \nalleged at SOR \u00b6 1.b. \n \n \n \nApplicant was convicted of 11 merged counts of possession of child pornography \nin March 2007. He was sentenced to supervised probation for three years, until March \n2010. He was still serving his probation when the record closed.  \n \n \n \nAt his DOHA hearing, despite being convicted of child pornography, Applicant \ncontinued to deny responsibility for his criminal conduct, which occurred approximately \nfive years ago. While his conduct was not recent, his failure to acknowledge \nresponsibility raises concerns about a failure of rehabilitation. See ISCR Case No. 08-\n03620 (App. Bd. May 6, 2009). Applicant\u2019s unwillingness to acknowledge his criminal \nconduct also casts doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. I \n\n \n10 \n \n \nconclude that AG \u00b6 32(a) and AG \u00b6 32(d) do not apply in mitigation to Applicant\u2019s \ncriminal conduct. \n \n \nGuideline D, Sexual Behavior \n  \n \nAG \u00b6 12 explains why sexual behavior is a security concern: \n \n \nSexual behavior that involves a criminal offense, indicates a personality or \nemotional disorder, reflects lack of judgment or discretion, or which may \nsubject the individual to undue influence or coercion, exploitation, or \nduress can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness \nand ability to protect classified information. . .  . \n \n \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant\u2019s criminal convictions for misdemeanor \npossession of child pornography also raised security concerns under the sexual \nbehavior adjudicative guideline.  \n \n \nThe SOR allegations raise security concerns under AG \u00b6\u00b6 13(a), 13(c), and \n13(d). AG \u00b6 13(a) reads: \u201csexual behavior of a criminal nature, whether or not the \nindividual has been prosecuted.\u201d AG \u00b6 13(c) reads: \u201csexual behavior that causes an \nindividual to be vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or duress.\u201d AG \u00b6 13(d) reads: \n\u201csexual behavior of a public nature and/or that reflects lack of discretion or judgment.\u201d \n \nApplicant\u2019s possession of child pornography was sexual behavior of a criminal \nnature which made him vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or duress. Moreover, \nApplicant\u2019s possession of child pornography reflected a lack of discretion and judgment. \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 14 lists four possible mitigating conditions that could apply to sexual \nbehavior that raises security concerns. Applicant\u2019s disqualifying sexual behavior \noccurred in 2005, and in March 2007, he was convicted of 11 merged counts of \npossession of child pornography. Despite his conviction, Applicant continues to deny \nthat he possessed child pornography, even though a search of his residence resulted in \ninvestigators finding numerous images of child pornography. \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 14(b) might apply if \u201cthe sexual behavior happened so long ago, so \ninfrequently, or under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and does \nnot cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d \nAG \u00b6 14(c) might apply if \u201cthe behavior no longer serves as a basis for coercion, \nexploitation, or duress.\u201d As a mature adult, Applicant continued to deny his criminal \nsexual behavior, knowing it was not minor, so remote in time, so infrequent, or had \noccurred under such unique circumstances that it would not seriously impact his \neligibility for a security clearance. His denials cast doubt on his current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and good judgment. Additionally, his denials raise concerns that his \nsexual behavior may serve as a basis for coercion, exploitation, or duress in the future.  \nI conclude that AG \u00b6\u00b6 14(b) and 14(c) do not apply. I also conclude that the other two \n\n \n11 \n \n \nsexual behavior mitigating conditions, AG \u00b6\u00b6 14(a) and 14(d), are not raised by the facts \nof this case. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of an applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole person concept. \n        \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is a mature adult who is \nrespected and appreciated by his family members, friends, supervisors, and co-workers. \nThey find him to be sensible, responsible, and trustworthy. These perspectives suggest \nsuccessful rehabilitation. \n \nApplicant was convicted of possession of child pornography, which was found  \nduring a search of his residence. Applicant argued that the child pornography belonged \nto his housemate. He had an opportunity to fully litigate the charges against him. After \nhis conviction, he continued to deny that he had possessed child pornography and \nargued that the pornography belonged to his housemate. I conclude that, in this \nadministrative adjudication, the doctrine of collateral estoppel applies to Applicant\u2019s \nstate court conviction on 11 charges of misdemeanor possession of child pornography. \n \nApplicant\u2019s denial of responsibility for the conduct for which he was convicted \nraises continuing concerns about lack of rehabilitation and vulnerability to coercion. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about Applicant\u2019s \neligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For these reasons, I conclude Applicant \nfailed to mitigate the security concerns arising from his criminal conduct and sexual \nbehavior. \n \n \n  \n\n \n12 \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline J:  \n \nAGAINST  APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a.:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b.:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline D:             \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a.:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \n                          Conclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is a 58-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He served in the Army from 1972 to 1974 as a Sergeant. He received a Meritorious Service Medal and two Amy Commendation Medals during his service. He had a secret clearance while in the Army. He possesses an associate\u2019s degree in chemical engineering. He is divorced and has one daughter, age 25, who is in graduate school. Applicant provided no letters of support, performance evaluations, or other evidence of his character. (GE 1; Tr. 24- 30.) Applicant has experienced significant financial problems since at least 1994. In 1994, he purchased a home and \u201cover the next few years, [he] was overextended and was having trouble meeting [his] bills.\u201d His financial problems continued in 2001, when he withdrew $40,000 from his 401K to purchase a car and take care of some other debts. As a result of withdrawing money from his 401K, he incurred both state and Federal tax debts, which were eventually garnished from his wages. The garnishments caused him to fall behind on his mortgage in September of 2002. His home was foreclosed upon in 2003. As a result of the foreclosure, Applicant received $42,000 profit from the sale. He used the profit from the house for his daughter\u2019s education and to support an academic team she participated in. Applicant attributes his current 3 financial problems to his financial support of that academic team from 1995 through 2005. For approximately one year during that time frame, he ",

The action was taken under Executive Order \n(EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) effective for cases issued after September 1, 2006.  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on February 3, 2010, and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on May 21, 2010. DOHA \nissued a notice of hearing on June 3, 2010, scheduling the hearing for June 28, 2010. \nApplicant requested a continuance. Based upon good cause, the continuance was \n\n \n2 \n \ngranted, and the hearing was rescheduled on June 30, 2010, for July 26, 2010. The \nhearing was convened as scheduled. The Government offered Exhibits (GE) 1 through \n11, which were admitted without objection. The Applicant no offered Exhibits and called \nno witnesses, but did testify on his own behalf. The record was held open for Applicant \nto submit additional information until close of business August 8, 2010. Applicant failed \nto submit any post-hearing exhibits. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on \nAugust 5, 2010.  \n \nProcedural Ruling \n \nAt the hearing on July 26, 2010, Department Counsel made a motion to amend \nthe SOR, in order to conform to the evidence, by adding \u00b6\u00b61.n. through 1.q., pursuant to \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.17. Applicant had no objections to the amendment. The motion to \namend was granted. (Tr. 49-52.)The allegations are as follows: \n \n \n1.n. You willfully failed to file your Federal income tax return for the tax year \n2008. As of the date of this hearing, you had not filed. \n \n1.o. You willfully failed to file your [state] income tax return for the tax year 2008. \nAs of the date of this hearing, you had not filed. \n \n1.p. You willfully failed to file your Federal income tax return for the tax year \n2009. As of the date of this hearing, you had not filed. \n \n1.q. You willfully failed to file your [state] income tax return for the tax year 2009. \nAs of the date of this hearing, you had not filed. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is a 58-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He served in the \nArmy from 1972 to 1974 as a Sergeant. He received a Meritorious Service Medal and \ntwo Amy Commendation Medals during his service. He had a secret clearance while in \nthe Army. He possesses an associate\u2019s degree in chemical engineering. He is divorced \nand has one daughter, age 25, who is in graduate school. Applicant provided no letters \nof support, performance evaluations, or other evidence of his character. (GE 1; Tr. 24-\n30.) \n \n \nApplicant has experienced significant financial problems since at least 1994. In \n1994, he purchased a home and \u201cover the next few years, [he] was overextended and \nwas having trouble meeting [his] bills.\u201d His financial problems continued in 2001, when \nhe withdrew $40,000 from his 401K to purchase a car and take care of some other \ndebts. As a result of withdrawing money from his 401K, he incurred both state and \nFederal tax debts, which were eventually garnished from his wages. The garnishments \ncaused him to fall behind on his mortgage in September of 2002. His home was \nforeclosed upon in 2003. As a result of the foreclosure, Applicant received $42,000 \nprofit from the sale. He used the profit from the house for his daughter\u2019s education and \nto support an academic team she participated in. Applicant attributes his current \n\n \n3 \n \nfinancial problems to his financial support of that academic team from 1995 through \n2005. For approximately one year during that time frame, he was giving his daughter\u2019s \nteam $500 to $1,200 per month in financial support. (GE 2; GE 3; Tr. 30-35, 55, 63.) \n \n \nThe SOR alleges seven delinquent debts as listed on credit reports obtained in \n2007 through 2010. (GE 7; GE 8; GE 9; GE 10; GE 11.) They are as follows: \n \n \nAllegation 1.a. alleges that Applicant is indebted on a collections account for the \napproximate amount of $107. Applicant admitted this debt in his Answer to the SOR. \nApplicant claims that this debt has been paid, although he presented no documentation \nto support his claim. Applicant\u2019s credit report dated July 25, 2010, reflects this debt as \n\u201cunpaid.\u201d (GE 11; Tr. 35-36.) \n \nAllegation 1.b. alleges that Applicant is indebted on a collections account for the \napproximate amount of $156. Applicant admitted this debt in his Answer to the SOR. \nApplicant claims that this debt has been paid, although he presented no documentation \nto support his claim. Applicant\u2019s credit report dated July 25, 2010, reflects this debt as \n\u201cunpaid.\u201d (GE 11; Tr. 36-37.) \n \nAllegation 1.c. alleges that Applicant is indebted on a past due account for the \napproximate amount of $765. Applicant denied this debt in his Answer to the SOR, \nbecause he claims he paid it off. Applicant\u2019s credit report dated July 25, 2010, reflects \nthis debt as a \u201cpaid charge off\u201d and supports Applicant\u2019s claim. (GE 11; Tr. 37-38.) \n \nAllegation 1.d. alleges that Applicant is indebted on credit card account for the \napproximate amount of $2,501. Applicant denied this debt in his Answer to the SOR, \nbecause he was making $200 payments on this account for over a year. He claimed \nthat he has repaid all but $381. Applicant\u2019s credit report dated July 25, 2010, reflects the \ncurrent balance on this debt is $381, which supports Applicant\u2019s claim that he has been \nmaking payments on this account. (GE 11; Tr. 38-40.) \n \nAllegation 1.e. alleges that Applicant is indebted on a collections account for the \napproximate amount of $1,392. Applicant admitted this debt in his Answer to the SOR. \nApplicant claims that this debt has been paid, although he presented no documentation \nto support his claim. Applicant\u2019s credit report dated July 25, 2010, reflects this debt as \nan unpaid collections account. (GE 11; Tr. 41-42.) \n \nAllegation 1.f. alleges that Applicant is indebted to a telephone company for the \napproximate amount of $184. Applicant denied this debt in his Answer to the SOR, \nbecause he had made arrangements to pay this debt. Applicant claims that this debt \nhas been paid, although he presented no documentation to support his claim. \nApplicant\u2019s credit report dated February 27, 2009, reflects this debt with an unpaid \nbalance. (GE 8; Tr. 36-37.) \n \nAllegation 1.g. alleges that Applicant is indebted on Federal tax debt for the \napproximate amount of $13,435. Applicant admitted this debt in his Answer to the SOR. \nApplicant testified that he hired an agent to negotiate a settlement with the IRS. He \n\n \n4 \n \nfailed to provide documentation showing he hired an agent in January 2009, to assist \nhim with this debt or that he has successfully negotiated payment on this debt with the \nIRS. (GE 4; Tr. 42-44, 47, 53.) \n \nAllegations 1.h. through 1.q. allege that Applicant failed to file both his Federal \nIncome Tax return and his state tax return for the tax years 2005-2009. Applicant \ndenied these allegations in his Answer to the SOR. At hearing, he claimed that he filed \nboth state and Federal income tax returns for 2005-2007, electronically through a \npopular tax preparation computer program. He claims the agent he hired in January \n2010, was assisting him with his 2005-2007 taxes, as well. When asked if he filed his \n2008 and 2009 state and Federal income tax returns, he indicated he had not, but \nplanned to complete them. (GE 3; Tr. 44-49.) \n \n \nApplicant is current on his two car payments. He purchased a BMW for himself \nand a Mercedes for his daughter. He pays the insurance of both vehicles. (Tr. 57-58.) \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \n\n \n5 \n \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern for Financial Considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18, as \nfollows:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concern under \nAG \u00b6 19. Three are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts;  \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n \n(g) failure to file annual Federal, state, or local income tax returns as \nrequired or the fraudulent filing of the same. \n \n \nApplicant accumulated delinquent debts and has been unable or unwilling to pay \nhis obligations. His delinquencies have been on-going for several years, and he has \nfailed to establish resolution of the majority of his delinquent accounts. He has a history, \ndating back to approximately 1994, of financial irresponsibility. Further, the Government \nestablished that Applicant failed to file his Federal and state income tax returns for tax \nyears 2005-2009. The evidence is sufficient to raise the above disqualifying conditions. \n \n \n \nFive Financial Considerations mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable:  \n\n \n6 \n \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control;  \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \nApplicant has satisfied one of his debts (SOR allegation 1.c.) and is successfully \nmaking payments on one debt (SOR allegation 1.d.), but he has failed to establish he \nhas taken action on his other delinquent accounts. His debt is current and on-going. \nFurther, financial difficulties have plagued Applicant for a number of years and are likely \nto recur. AG \u00b6 20(a) is not applicable.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s financial difficulties were partly caused by his poor financial decisions. \nThese decisions do not qualify as conditions that were outside his control. Further, AG \u00b6 \n20(b) also requires that the individual act responsibly under the circumstances. \nApplicant has not made a significant attempt to responsibly address his remaining \ndebts. AG \u00b6 20(b) is not applicable. \n \n \nApplicant presented no evidence of financial counseling. AG \u00b6 20(c) does not \napply. \n \n \nApplicant has satisfied one of his debts (SOR allegation 1.c.) and is making \npayments on another (SOR allegation 1.d.). However, he has not made payment \narrangements with any of his other creditors. There is no showing he has initiated a \ngood-faith effort to repay his remaining overdue creditors or otherwise resolve his debts. \nIn addition, he failed to show he has acted in good faith with respect to resolving his \nunfiled state and Federal income tax returns. AG \u00b6 20(d) is not mitigating. \n \n \nFinally, Applicant has not contested his outstanding debts. AG \u00b6 20(e) is not \nmitigating. \n\n \n7 \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guidelines F, in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(a) were \naddressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional comment.  \n \nApplicant failed to demonstrate good judgment when it comes to satisfying his \nfinancial delinquencies. His choices, with respect to his debts, do not demonstrate the \njudgment, reliability, or trustworthiness needed to hold a security clearance. There are \nsignificant unresolved concerns about Applicant\u2019s finances and judgment.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has not mitigated Financial Considerations security concern.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a.:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c.:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.d.:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.e.:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n\n \n8 \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.f.:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.g.:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.h.:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.i.:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.j.:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.k.:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.l.:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.m.:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.n.:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.o.:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.p.:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.q.:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

Stevens, Esquire, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro Se \n \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \nCREAN, THOMAS M., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant submitted her Questionnaire for Public Trust Positions (SF 85P) as part \nof her employment with a defense contractor on November 6, 2007 (Item 5). On May 5, \n2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued Applicant a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing trustworthiness concerns for financial \nconsiderations (Item 1). The action was taken under Department of Defense Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); Department of Defense (DoD) Regulation 5200.2-R, \nPersonnel Security Program, dated Jan. 1987, as amended (Regulation), and the \nrevised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, \n2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September \n1, 2006. Applicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on June 30, 2009 (Item 3).  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on July 2, 2009. She admitted 17 and \ndenied five of the 22 allegations under Guideline F. She also denied the public trust \nconcern raised by her financial issues. She elected to have the matter decided on the \nwritten record in lieu of a hearing (Item 4). Department counsel submitted the \nGovernment\u2019s written case on October 5, 2009. Applicant received a complete file of \nrelevant material (FORM) on November 19, 2009, and was provided the opportunity to \nfile objections, and submit material to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the disqualifying \n1 \n \nJanuary 26, 2010\n\n2 \n \nconditions. Applicant timely provided additional information in response to the FORM. \nThe case was assigned to me on January 11, 2010. Based on a review of the case file \nand pleadings, eligibility for access to sensitive information is denied. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn her Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the factual allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.c, \n1.e to 1.l, 1.n to 1.r, and 1.t to 1.v. She denied the debts at SOR \u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 1.d, 1.m, \nand 1.s. \n \n \nApplicant is 29 years old and has been a claims analyst for a defense contractor \nfor over eight years. She is married with no children (Item 5). There is no information in \nthe case file indicting her monthly income and expenses. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s answer to the SOR (Item 4), her answers to interrogatories (Items 7 \nand 8), and credit reports (Items 9 and 10) establish that Applicant has delinquent \ndebts, totaling approximately $66,701. The documents support the debts for: a state tax \nlien of $365 (SOR 1.a); medical debts of $140 (SOR 1.b), $182 (SOR 1.c), $145 (SOR \n1.d), $980 (SOR 1.e), $537 (SOR 1.f), $237 (SOR 1.g), $56 (SOR 1.h), $175 (SOR 1.i), \n$55 (SOR 1.j), $1,198 (SOR 1.k), $608 (SOR 1.l), and $88 (SOR 1.m); a credit card in \ncollection for $8,858 (SOR 1.n): a charged off debt for $1,211 (SOR 1.o); a debt of \n$8,782 for a repossessed vehicle (SOR 1.p); a cell phone account in collection for $211 \n(SOR 1.q); a debt of $41,237 for a repossessed mobile home (SOR 1.r); a debt in \ncollection for telephone service for $61 (SOR 1.s); a charged-off debt to a department \nstore for $1,513 (SOR 1.t); and two debts in collection to the same collection agency for \nthe same utility for $504 (SOR 1.u), and $321 (SOR 1.v). \n \n \nApplicant provided documentation that the debt at SOR 1.s was paid in full (item \n4 at 7). She provided documentation of payment of $168.60 to a creditor for a debt \nowed to a hospital. It appears this is the debt listed at SOR 1.d and the debt would be \npaid in full (Item 4 at 8). She provided documentation of payment of $100 on a medical \ndebt (Item 4 at 6). The original debt on the receipt is for $1,197, so the payment pertains \nto a payment on the debt at SOR 1.k. Applicant provided documentation that the debt at \nSOR 1.a was satisfied by use of her state tax refund (Item 4 at 9, Item 6). \n \n \nIn response to interrogatories, Applicant stated that some of her debts were \ndisputed, but provided no documentation concerning the dispute or any resolution of the \ndisputes. For some debts, she indicated she would make payment arrangements. She \npresented no documentation concerning any payment arrangements.  \n \n \nWhen Applicant was interviewed by a security investigator, she stated she co-\nsigned the loans for the repossessed mobile home listed at SOR 1.r and the \nrepossessed car listed at SOR 1.p for the same person. That person was current on the \nloan payments until she lost her job. Since Applicant had her own mortgage and car \npayments, she could not afford to pay the two repossession debts. In response to the \nFORM, Applicant provided a letter from the person for whom she co-signed the loan, \nverifying that Applicant co-signed the loans and that the loans were current until she lost \n\n3 \n \nher job (Response to FORM, Letter, dated November 19, 2009). Applicant believes one \nof the delinquent debts may be for a computer she co-signed for. The person she co-\nsigned for indicated in the Response to the FORM that she was current on the debt until \n\"things got hard with money.\" Later she tried to make payments but the loan had gone \nto collections and she did not know the new creditor. When she learns the address of \nthe new creditor, she will again make payments (Response to FORM, Letter dated \nNovember 19, 2009).  \n \nPolicies \n \nPositions designated as ADP I and ADP II are classified as \u201csensitive positions.\u201d  \n(See Regulation \u00b6\u00b6 C3.1.2.1.1.7 and C3.1.2.1.2.3.)  \u201cThe standard that must be met for \n. . . assignment to sensitive duties is that, based on all available information, the \nperson\u2019s loyalty, reliability, and trustworthiness are such that . . . assigning the person to \nsensitive duties is clearly consistent with the interests of national security.\u201d (See \nRegulation \u00b6 C6.1.1.1.) The Deputy Under Secretary of Defense (Counterintelligence \nand Security) Memorandum, dated November 19, 2004, indicates trustworthiness \nadjudications will apply to cases forwarded to DOHA by the Defense Security Service \nand Office of Personnel Management. Department of Defense contractor personnel are \nafforded the right to the procedures contained in the Directive before any final \nunfavorable access determination may be made. (See Regulation \u00b6 C8.2.1.)   \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a public trust position, the \nadministrative judge must consider the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the AG. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of \nhuman behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the \nadjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, \nimpartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a \nconscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d \nThe administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the \nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \n[sensitive] information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable \ntrustworthiness decision.  \n \n\n4 \n \nA person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to sensitive information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard sensitive information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nsensitive information. \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by \nrules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual=s reliability, \ntrustworthiness and ability to protect sensitive information. An individual who is \nfinancially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds \n(AG \u00b6 18). Similarly, an individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or careless in their obligation to protect sensitive \ninformation. Behaving responsibly or irresponsibly in one aspect of life provides an \nindication of how a person may behave in other aspects of life. \n \n \nA person\u2019s relationship with her creditors is a private matter until evidence is \nuncovered demonstrating an inability or unwillingness to repay debts under agreed \nterms. Absent evidence of strong extenuating or mitigating circumstances, an applicant \nwith a history of serious or recurring financial difficulties is in a situation of risk \ninconsistent with the holding of access to sensitive information. An applicant is not \nrequired to be debt free, but is required to manage her finances in such a way as to \nmeet her financial obligations. Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts from credit cards and \nmedical debts, repossessions, and department stores as established by credit reports \nand Applicant\u2019s admissions, are a public trust concern raising Financial Consideration \nDisqualifying Conditions (FC DC) \u00b619(a) (inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts), and \nFC DC \u00b6 19(c) (a history of not meeting financial obligations). Applicant has significant \ndelinquent debts that she has not resolved.   \n \n \nI have considered a number of Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions \n(FC MC). FC MC \u00b6 20(a) (the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment) does not apply. \nWhile the debts may have been incurred in the past, some are still unpaid and thus \ncurrent. There are a number of different accounts and debts, so the debts were not \nincurred infrequently. Applicant has not presented any information to establish that the \ndelinquent debts will not recur. Her continued debts and financial situation cast doubt on \nher current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment.  \n \n\n5 \n \n \nI considered FC MC \u00b6 20(b) (the conditions that resulted in the financial problems \nwere largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce, or separations) and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances). Applicant has not presented any \ninformation to establish circumstances beyond her control that caused her delinquent \ndebts. She stated that at least three of the largest debts were caused when she co-\nsigned loans for a mobile home, a car, and a computer and the borrower defaulted. \nApplicant willingly co-signed the loans so her actions were not beyond her control. \nWhen a person co-signs a loan, there is a risk the borrower will default. Applicant \nshould have realized she was putting her finances at risk and ensured she could \nmanage the debt if there was a default. She could not handle the debt, so she did not \nact reasonably and responsibly.  \n \n \nI considered FC MC \u00b6 20(a) (the person has received or is receiving counseling \nfor the problem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or \nis under control). Applicant presented no information to indicate she received financial \ncounseling. Even if she had received counseling, there is no indication her financial \nproblems are being resolved or under control. She is not making payments on her \ndelinquent debts, and does not have a plan to resolve her delinquent debts.  \n \n \nI considered FC MC \u00b6 20(d) (the individual has initiated a good-faith effort to \nrepay the overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts). Applicant presented \ndocumentation that three of her delinquent debts have been settled and paid. However, \none debt was resolved by the state using a tax refund to pay the debt. This is not a \ngood-faith effort to resolve the debt, but the result of a forced action by the state. \nHowever, the debt has been paid. For FC MC \u00b6 20(d) to apply, there must be an \u201cability\u201d \nto repay the debts, the \u201cdesire\u201d to repay, and \u201cevidence\u201d of a good-faith effort to repay. \nA systematic, concrete method of handling debts is needed. Good-faith means acting in \na way that shows reasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or \nobligation. Evidence of past irresponsibility is not mitigated by payment of debt only \nunder pressure of qualifying for a security clearance. Applicant presented information to \nshow she paid three of the 22 delinquent debts. Applicant did not present a concrete \nplan to show how she would pay her remaining delinquent debts. Her only statement \nwas that she was currently working to obtain money to settle the remaining debts. She \ndid not provide information about how she was trying to raise funds to pay the debts. A \npromise to pay debts in the future is not evidence of a good-faith intention to resolve \ndebts. Applicant did not present sufficient information to establish a good-faith effort to \npay creditors or resolve debts. Her finances are not under control and she has not acted \nresponsibly towards her finances. She has not mitigated security concerns for financial \nconsiderations. \n \n\u201cWhole Person\u201d Analysis  \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s security eligibility by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all \nthe circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative \nprocess factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n\n6 \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant a security clearance \nmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nguidelines and the whole person concept.  \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant has not presented \ninformation to show she has taken sufficient action to resolve her financial issues. \nApplicant must establish that she has a \"meaningful track record\" of debt payment, \nincluding evidence of actual debt reduction through payment of debts. She is not \nrequired, as a matter of law, to establish that she paid off each and every debt listed in \nthe SOR. All that is required is that she has a plan to resolve her financial problems and \ntakes significant action to implement that plan. The entirety of her financial situation and \nher actions can reasonably be considered in evaluating the extent to which his plan to \nreduce his outstanding indebtedness is credible and realistic. Available, reliable \ninformation about the person's behavior, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, \nshould be considered in reaching a determination.  \n \nApplicant has not established a \"meaningful track record\" of debt payment by \npresenting information to show she is taking sufficient, consistent, reasonable, and \nresponsible action to resolve her financial issues. She did resolve three small delinquent \ndebts. But this is only a small part of her delinquent debts. She did not present a plan to \nshow she intends to resolve and pay her remaining delinquent debts. Applicant has not \ndemonstrated she is responsibly managing her finances under the circumstances. She \ndoes not have a consistent record of actions to resolve financial issues. She has not \nestablished that she has or will take reasonable steps to address her remaining \ndelinquent debts and resolve her financial problems. The record does show she has \nbeen irresponsible towards her financial obligations. The lack of responsible \nmanagement of finances obligations indicates she will not be concerned or responsible, \nbut will be careless, in regard to sensitive information. Overall, the record evidence \nleaves me with questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. She has not established her suitability for access to sensitive \ninformation. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the public \ntrust concerns arising from her financial situation. Access to sensitive information is \ndenied. \n \n \n \n \n\n7 \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \nFor Applicant  \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.e:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.f:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.g:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.h:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.i:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.j:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.k:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.l:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.m:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.n:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.o:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.p:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.q:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.r:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.s:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.t:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.u:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.v:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a public trust \nposition.

The action was taken under Executive Order 10865,\nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended;\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised\nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and\neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on August 1, 2009, and elected to\nhave her case decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. Department Counsel\nsubmitted the government\u2019s written case on October 5, 2009.  Applicant received a\n1\nDecember 15, 2009\n\n2\ncomplete file of relevant material (FORM) on October 21, 2009, and was provided an\nopportunity to file objections and submit material to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the\ngovernment\u2019s case. Applicant submitted additional documentary information (AE A) in a\ntimely manner. The case was assigned to me on November 21, 2009. Eligibility for\naccess to classified information is denied.\nProcedural and Evidentiary Rulings\nDepartment Counsel submitted a formal request that I take administrative notice\nof certain facts relating to the Russian Federation (Russia). The request and the\nattached documents are included in the record as Item 4. The facts administratively\nnoticed are set out in the Findings of Facts, below.\nFindings of Fact\nIn her answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the factual allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, \n2.b, d, e, and f. She denied the factual allegation in \u00b6 2.a. Her admissions are\nincorporated in my findings of fact. I make the following findings:\nApplicant is a 24-year-old employee of a defense contractor. She has worked in\nthe financial/insurance field in the United States since June 2001. She has been\nemployed with her current employer since March 2008 (Item 1).\nApplicant was born in Russia but moved to the United States with her mother\nwhen she was young. She graduated from an American high school in 1999, and\nattended a college in the United States from 2003 to 2007. Applicant obtained her\ndegree in economics and finance in 2007. She is single and has no children (Item 1).\nShe became a naturalized U.S. citizen in October 2000. \nApplicant\u2019s parents are divorced. Her mother is a United States naturalized citizen\nand lives in the United States. Her father is a citizen and resident of Russia. Applicant\nhas no contact with him. Applicant has not seen him since her parents divorce in Russia.\nHe is not involved in her life. She does maintain contact with his mother (her paternal\ngrandmother) by phone every couple of years. Applicant acknowledged that she also\nvisited her grandmother during her four trips to Russia (Item 5).\nApplicant\u2019s maternal grandparents are citizens and residents of Russia. Her\ngrandmother is approximately 80 years old and is in poor health. Her grandfather is 86\nyears old and is also in poor health. He retired in 1991, from his position as an engineer\nfrom a research and development center. They both receive pension benefits from the\ngovernment for their service in World War II. She talks to her grandparents on a monthly\nbasis. She visited them in 1998, 1999, 2004, and 2007. Her grandparents also visited\nApplicant in the United States on various occasions. Applicant has an aunt and uncle\nwho live in Russia. Applicant\u2019s aunt is retired from her position as an economist with the\ngovernment in Russia. Her uncle is employed with a research center in Russia.\nApplicant also has a cousin who lives in Russia. Her cousin is a professor at a national\n\n3\nuniversity in Russia. Applicant maintains communication with her relatives through\nelectronic mail approximately twice a year (Item 5). Applicant\u2019s family has no knowledge\nthat Applicant is seeking a security clearance (Item 5).\nIn September 2008, Applicant told a security investigator that she maintains dual\ncitizenship with Russia and the United States because she travels to Russia and her\nRussian passport makes her travel easy. She also reports that it would hurt her\ngrandparents if she relinquished her Russian citizenship. They want Applicant to return\nto Russia. Applicant intends to keep her dual citizenship until her grandparents\u2019 death.\nShe may also inherit an apartment from her grandparents when they die, and admits that\nmaintaining her Russian citizenship would benefit her in this process. She states she will\nno longer have any use for dual citizenship after their death. \nApplicant\u2019s Russian passport, reissued on April 28 2009, is valid until 2014. She\nmaintained a previous passport from June 2001 until June 2008, when it expired. She\nused her current Russian passport to travel to Russia in 2004 and 2007. She intends to\nuse her Russian passport for future visits to Russia. She fears that if she needed to visit\nher grandparents for a medical emergency a visa with a United States passport would\ndelay the trip.\nApplicant expressed a willingness to renounce her Russian citizenship if her job\nrequired it. She maintained that her sense of loyalty to Russia is based on her familial\nrelationship with her grandparents. She does not feel a sense of obligation to Russia,\nand she maintains that her ultimate loyalty is to the United States (Item 5). She intends\nto permanently make her home in the United States.\nI have taken administrative notice that the Russian Federation (Russia) has an\nincreasingly centralized political system, with power concentrated in the president and\nprime minister, a weak multiparty political system, and a ruling-party dominated\nbicameral legislature. Russia\u2019s large population of more than 142 million people is both\nmultinational and multi-ethnic. Russia is a nuclear superpower that since the dissolution\nof the Soviet Union, continues to develop politically, socially, and economically. \nRussia has an active, recent, and ongoing collection program targeting the United\nStates. Russia and China have been the most aggressive collectors of sensitive and\nprotected United States technology and accounted for the majority of such targeting.\nRussia\u2019s lead in the targeting of United States technologies, through its industrial\nespionage efforts, goes back to 1997. Russian espionage specializes in military\ntechnology and gas and oil industry technical expertise.\nBeyond collection activities and espionage directed at the United States, Russia\nprovides various military technologies to other countries, including Iran, Syria, and\nVenezuela. Also, despite United States concerns, Russia has refused to cease\nconstructing nuclear reactors in Iran. The United States has imposed economic\nsanctions on the Russian government for exporting nuclear and military technology and\nequipment to Iran and Syria.\n\n4\nRussia\u2019s human rights record remains uneven and poor in some areas. Additional\nspecific instances of these human rights abuses, as reported by the United States\nDepartment of State, include: reports that the government or its agents committed\npolitically motivated killings and other arbitrary killings, credible reports that law\nenforcement engaged in torture, abuse and violence, extremely harsh and life\nthreatening prison conditions, and arbitrary arrest and detention.\nPolicies\n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d  Department of the Navy v. Egan,\n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  As Commander in Chief, the President has \u201cthe authority to . .\n. control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an\nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position . . . that will give that person\naccess to such information.\u201d  Id. at 527.  The President has authorized the Secretary of\nDefense or his designee to grant applicants eligibility for access to classified information\n\u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d  Exec.\nOr. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as\namended and modified.  \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon an applicant meeting the\ncriteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG).  These guidelines are not\ninflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these\nguidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An\nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and\ncommonsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable\ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable.\nThe government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with\naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and\nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the\npossible risk an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard\nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible\nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified\ninformation.\nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no\nsense be a determination as to the loyalty of an applicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. Or.\n10865 \u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is not necessarily a\ndetermination as to the loyalty of an applicant. It is merely an indication an applicant has\nnot met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have\nestablished for issuing a clearance\nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the\npersonal or professional history of an applicant that may disqualify an applicant from\nbeing eligible for access to classified information.  he government has the burden of\nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.\n\n5\n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v.\nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994).  The guidelines\npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the\ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611\nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).  \nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial\nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the\nfacts.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it\nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d\nISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance\ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531;\nsee AG \u00b6 2(b). \nAnalysis\nGuideline B (Foreign Influence)\nThe \nSOR \nalleges \nApplicant\u2019s \nfather, \nmaternal \ngrandparents, \npaternal\ngrandmother, aunt, uncle, and cousin are citizens and residents of Russia who hold or\nhave held positions with the Russian government. The SOR alleges that Applicant visited\nRussia in 1998, 1999, 2004, and 2007 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a-2.f). The security concern relating to\nGuideline B is set out in AG \u00b6 6 as follows: \nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual\nhas divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or\ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a\nway that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by\nany foreign interest. Adjudication under this Guideline can and should\nconsider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or\nfinancial interest is located, including, but not limited to, such\nconsiderations as whether the foreign country is known to target United\nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a\nrisk of terrorism.\nA disqualifying condition may be raised by \u201ccontact with a foreign family member,\nbusiness or professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident\nin a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation,\ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion.\u201d  AG \u00b6 7(a). A disqualifying condition\nalso may be raised by \u201cconnections to a foreign person, group, government, or country\nthat creates a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to protect\nsensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person,\ngroup, or country by providing that information.\u201d AG \u00b6 7(b). Applicant\u2019s grandparents are\ncitizens and residents of Russia. She contacts her grandparents approximately once a\nmonth. She last visited them in 2007. Applicant hopes to visit them in the future. They\nhave visited her in the United States. Applicant\u2019s grandfather retired from a Russian\n\n6\nspace firm. She also has an aunt who was employed with the Russian government and\nstill resides in Russia. Her uncle and cousin are citizens and residents of Russia. They\nwork for the Russian government. Based on this evidence, AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a) and (b) are\nraised.\nSince the government produced evidence to raise the disqualifying condition in\nAG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a), the burden shifted to Applicant to produce evidence to rebut, explain,\nextenuate, or mitigate the facts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of\nproving a mitigating condition, and the burden of disproving it never shifts to the\ngovernment.  See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \nSecurity concerns under this guideline can be mitigated by showing that \u201cthe\nnature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which these persons are\nlocated, or the positions or activities of those persons in that country are such that it is\nunlikely the individual will be placed in a position of having to choose between the\ninterests of a foreign individual, group, organization, or government and the interests of\nthe U.S.\u201d  AG \u00b6 8(a). The totality of an applicant\u2019s family ties to a foreign country as well\nas each individual family tie must be considered.  ISCR Case No. 01-22693 at 7 (App.\nBd. Sep. 22, 2003). Similarly, AG 8(c) \u201ccontact or communication with foreign citizens is\nso casual and infrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign\ninfluence or exploitation.\u201d Applicant has contacts with family members living in Russia so\nthese two mitigating conditions cannot be fully applied.\nGuideline B is not limited to countries hostile to the United States. \u201cThe United\nStates has a compelling interest in protecting and safeguarding classified information\nfrom any person, organization, or country that is not authorized to have access to it,\nregardless of whether that person, organization, or country has interests inimical to those\nof the United States.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 02-11570 at 5 (App. Bd. May 19, 2004). \nFurthermore, friendly nations can have profound disagreements with the United\nStates over matters they view as important to their vital interests or national security.\nFinally, friendly nations have engaged in espionage against the United States, especially\nin the economic, scientific, and technical fields.  See ISCR Case No. 00-0317, 2002\nDOHA LEXIS 83 at **15-16 (App. Bd. Mar. 29, 2002). Nevertheless, the nature of a\nnation\u2019s government, its relationship with the United States and its human rights record\nare relevant in assessing the likelihood that an applicant\u2019s family members are\nvulnerable to government coercion. The risk of coercion, persuasion, or duress is\nsignificantly greater if the foreign country has an authoritarian government, a family\nmember is associated with or dependent upon the government, or the country is known\nto conduct intelligence operations against the United States.\nSecurity concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing \u201cthere is\nno conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of loyalty or obligation to the\nforeign person, group, government, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such\ndeep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the individual\ncan be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest.\u201d \n\n7\nApplicant has demonstrated a strong loyalty to her family members in Russia. She\nmaintains her Russian citizenship for the sake of her grandparents. She also hopes to\ninherit property after their death. She has visited Russia on four occasions since 1998.\nShe exercised her dual citizenship with Russia by using her Russian passport after\nbecoming a naturalized United States citizen. AG \u00b6 8(b) does not apply. Applicant has\nnot mitigated security concerns under the foreign influence guideline.\nGuideline C (Foreign Preference)\nThe SOR alleges Applicant exercises dual citizenship with Russia and possesses\na Russian passport that has been renewed recently and does not expire until 2014 (\u00b6\n1.a). The concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 9 as follows: \u201cWhen an\nindividual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a foreign country over the\nUnited States, then he or she may be prone to provide information or make decisions\nthat are harmful to the interests of the United States.\u201d  \nDual citizenship standing alone is not sufficient to warrant an adverse security\nclearance decision.  ISCR Case No. 99-0454 at 5, 2000 WL 1805219 (App. Bd. Oct. 17,\n2000).  Under Guideline C, \u201cthe issue is not whether an applicant is a dual national, but\nrather whether an applicant shows a preference for a foreign country through actions.\u201d\nISCR Case No. 98-0252 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep 15, 1999).\nA disqualifying condition may arise from \u201cexercise of any right, privilege or\nobligation of foreign citizenship after becoming a U.S. citizen,\u201d including but not limited to\n\u201cpossession of a current foreign passport.\u201d  AG \u00b6 10(a)(1). Applicant possesses a valid\nRussian passport, which she has used since becoming a naturalized United States\ncitizen. AG \u00b6 10(a)(1) is established because Applicant renewed her Russian passport in\n2009, and she intends to her Russian passport in the future.   \nAG 10(d) \u201cany statement or action that shows allegiance to a country other than\nthe United States: for example, declaration of intent to renounce United States\ncitizenship.\u201d Applicant does not wish to renounce her United States citizenship, but she\nhas expressed a familial loyalty to her grandparents in Russia which causes her to keep\nher Russian passport. \nThe burden shifted to Applicant to rebut, explain, mitigate, or extenuate the facts.\nSeveral mitigating conditions are potentially relevant.\nSecurity concerns under this guideline may be mitigated by evidence that \u201cdual\ncitizenship is based solely on parents\u2019 citizenship or birth in a foreign country.\u201d  AG \u00b6\n11(a).  This mitigating condition applies because Applicant has exercised her dual\nRussian citizenship by renewing and using a Russian passport after her U.S.\nnaturalization.\nSecurity concerns under this guideline also may be mitigated if \u201cexercise of the\nrights, privileges, or obligations of foreign citizenship occurred before the individual\n\n8\nbecame a United States citizen or when the individual was a minor.\u201d AG \u00b6 11(c).\nApplicant has been a naturalized citizen since 2000, and has used her Russian passport\nafter that time to travel to Russia. She intends to travel to Russia in the future using her\nRussian passport. Under AG \u00b6 11(b) \u201cthe individual has expressed a willingness to\nrenounce dual citizenship\u201d is also a mitigating condition. Applicant stated that she would\nrenounce her Russian citizenship but only if her job requires it. Applicant\u2019s conditional\nwillingness to renounce her dual citizenship is not sufficient for mitigation under this\ncondition given the record as a whole. AG \u00b6 11(e) \u201cthe passport has been destroyed,\nsurrendered to the cognizant security authority, or otherwise is invalidated\u201d does not\napply because the passport was renewed and is valid until 2014.\nApplicant is a naturalized United States citizen who continues to maintain and use\nher Russian passport. She intends to travel to Russia in the future and will use her\nRussian passport. Her expressed willingness to renounce her citizenship is given little\nweight in light of the record evidence. Applicant has not mitigated the foreign preference\nconcerns under the above mitigating conditions.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a\nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. Some of the factors in AG\n\u00b6 2(a) were addressed above, but some warrant additional comment.\nThere are factors supporting the approval of Applicant\u2019s access to classified\ninformation. Applicant immigrated to the United States at a young age. She has lived in\nthe United States with her mother for a number of years. She became a naturalized\ncitizen in 2000. \nApplicant was born in Russia and is a dual citizen because of her birth in Russia.\nShe has a Russian passport which expires in 2014. Her elderly grandparents are retired\nand live in Russia and depend on the Russian government for their retirement benefits.\n\n9\nShe loves her grandparents and maintains contact with them. Her grandfather and\nrelatives hold or have held positions with the Russian government. She has visited them\nfour times since 1998 as recently as 2007. She retains her Russian passport to visit\nthem in an emergency. She maintains close contact with her relatives in Russia. Russia\nhas a poor record of human rights and has an active collection program targeting\nintelligence information as well as conducting industrial espionage of military technology.\nRussia\u2019s collection activities create a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, manipulation\nand pressure in this case.\nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guidelines B and\nC, and evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude\nApplicant has not mitigated the security concerns based on foreign influence and foreign\npreference. Accordingly, I conclude she has not carried her burden of showing that it is\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant her eligibility for access to classified\ninformation.\nFormal Findings\nI make the following formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set\nforth in the SOR, as required by Directive \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3:\nParagraph 1, Foreign Preference:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2, Foreign Influence:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.e:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.f:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.

Jeffreys, Esquire, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Alexander S. Michalakos, Esquire \n \n \n \n \n______________ \n \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nDAM, Shari, Administrative Judge: \n \n \nBased upon a review of the record as a whole, eligibility for access to classified \ninformation is granted. \n \nHistory of Case \n \nOn April 13, 2010, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued \nApplicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under Guideline C \n(Foreign Preference), Guideline B (Foreign Influence), and Guideline E (Personal \nConduct). The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense \nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the Adjudicative Guidelines effective \nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \nNovember 4, 2010\n\n \n \n \n \n2\n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on May 3, 2010, and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge. DOHA assigned the case to another administrative \njudge on July 28, 2010, and reassigned it to me on August 2, 2010. DOHA issued a \nNotice of Hearing on August 5, 2010, scheduling the hearing for August 25, 2010. On \nthat date, the Government offered Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 3 into evidence \nwithout objection. Applicant testified and offered Applicant Exhibits (AE) A through M \ninto evidence without objection. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on \nSeptember 3, 2010.  \n \nProcedural and Evidentiary Rulings \n \nRequest for Administrative Notice \n \nDepartment Counsel submitted a formal request that I take administrative notice \nof certain facts relating to Iraq. The request and the attached documents pertinent to \nIraq are included in the record as Hearing Exhibit (HE) 1 and contains attachments I \nthrough V (Tr. 14-15). Applicant did not object to my consideration of those Hearing \nExhibits. The facts administratively noticed are limited to matters of general knowledge \npertinent to Iraq, and not subject to reasonable dispute. The facts administratively \nnoticed are set out in the Findings of Fact, below.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the factual allegations contained in \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 2.a, 2.b, and 2.c. He denied the allegations contained in \u00b6 3.a.  \n \n \nApplicant is 42 years old. He was born in Iraq and attended high school there. He \nserved in the Iraqi navy from 1984 to 1986.  In 1990, he left Iraq as a refugee to escape \nSaddam Hussein\u2019s regime. He spent the next two years in a refugee camp in Saudi \nArabia. In December 1992, he came to the United States. He studied English and took \ncomputer classes at a junior college. He became a naturalized U.S. citizen in December \n2001. \n \n \nIn April 2003, Applicant married his wife, who was born in the Ukraine and was in \nthe United States on a student visa. She subsequently became a U.S. citizen. They do \nnot have children. They recently divorced although they still live together. He did not \nwant the divorce.  \n \n \nAfter arriving in the United States in December 1992, Applicant held various \npositions. He worked as an assistant manager for a restaurant and more recently, was a \nmanager for a large furniture store. In 2003, he applied for a linguist position with a \ndefense contractor. He completed a security clearance application (SF 86) in October \n2003. (GE 1.) He was not hired at that time. (Tr. 57.) \n \n \nBoth of Applicant\u2019s parents were born in Iraq. They are in their-mid sixties, and \nare citizens and residents of Iraq. His father is a retired farmer. His mother is a \n\n \n \n \n \n3\nhomemaker. His father was arrested and tortured by Saddam Hussein\u2019s government in \n1991. (GE 3.) \n \n \nApplicant has five brothers and one sister, all of whom were born in Iraq and \nreside there. One brother worked as a linguist for the U.S. Armed Forces for a period of \ntime. He is a teacher. One brother worked as a cook for a U.S. military base. One \nbrother worked in construction at a U.S. military base, but now owns a grocery store. \nOne brother is a farmer. One brother is blind and unemployed. His sister is a housewife. \nAll of his siblings are married, except one brother who lives with his parents. None of \nthose family members has been targeted by terrorists in Iraq. (Tr. 66.) Applicant speaks \nto his parents about once a month and his five siblings every couple months. He speaks \nto the brother who worked as a translator once a month. (Tr. 99.) He had a stepbrother \nwho was arrested and tortured in 1991. He is dead. (GE 3.) \n \n \nIn November 2006, Applicant went to Iraq to visit his mother who was very sick. \nHe had not returned to the country since leaving it in 1990 and had not seen his family \nsince then. He used his U.S. passport to enter Kuwait. His brother met him at the \nKuwaiti/Iraqi border and used family documents to gain admission for Applicant into \nIraq. His brother was concerned that if Applicant were identified as an American, he \nwould be in danger.  Within the next day or so, Applicant\u2019s brother helped him obtain an \nIraqi passport in his birth name. While there, he stayed at his parents\u2019 home. (Tr. 61.) \nWhen Applicant left three weeks later in December 2006, he gave the Iraqi passport to \nhis brother after he exited the Iraqi border and entered Kuwait. (Tr. 39.) He did not bring \nit with him to the United States because he did not want it and is \u201cproud to be an \nAmerican.\u201d (Tr. 39.) \n \n \nOn March 28, 2008, Applicant re-applied for a linguist position with the same \ndefense contractor and completed another security clearance application (e-QIP). In \nresponse to Section 17(d): \u201cIn the last 7 years, have you had an active passport that \nwas issued by a foreign government,\u201d he did not disclose his Iraqi passport. Applicant \ndenied that he intentionally failed to do so, and admitted that he made a mistake. (Tr. \n42.) He explained that after discussing the content of the e-QIP with his employer, they \nsent him the completed 33-page form, which he did not carefully review before signing \nit. (Tr. 43.) During an interview with a government investigator in October 2008, he \nexplained in detail how he obtained the Iraqi passport, but did not know whether it had \nexpired. He was willing to \u201crenounce\u201d the passport and his Iraqi citizenship.  (GE 3 at 5.)  \n \n \nIn December 2008, Applicant was hired by a defense contractor and returned to \nIraq to translate for the U.S. forces. While working in Iraq, he had telephonic contact \nwith his (interpreter) brother, who knew he was in the country. He did not have contact \nwith other family members because he was not permitted to do so. They did not know \nhe was in the country. (Tr. 61-62.) He does not have any plans to visit his family in Iraq, \nbut would like his parents to come to the United States. (Tr. 79.) His brother, who \nworked as an interpreter, may also immigrate here. (Tr. 63.) \n \n\n \n \n \n \n4\n \nOn August 16, 2009, Applicant was seriously injured in an explosion while on a \nmilitary mission. He was transported from Iraq to another country and then to the United \nStates. He was in a comatose state for approximately 40 days. (Tr. 91.) He has been in \nphysical rehabilitation for almost a year. He thinks his physician will authorize him to \nreturn to work soon. He wants to resume his translating duties with the U.S. troops. (Tr. \n92.) He said, \u201cI want to continue and I want to do my best to support this country.\u201d (Tr. \n53.)  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s Iraqi passport remained with his brother until January 2010, when \none of Applicant\u2019s friends, visiting Iraq, brought the passport to him in the United States. \nOn April 22, 2010, Applicant\u2019s facility security officer destroyed the passport, which was \nscheduled to expire on November 1, 2010. (AE L.)  \n \n \nApplicant does not own any property in Iraq. He owned a home in the United \nStates, but relinquished ownership to his wife as part of their divorce agreement. He \ndoes not have a retirement account, but does have a savings account here. (Tr. 92-93.) \nHe stated that he has not received any type of benefits or privileges from Iraq. (Id.) \n \n \nApplicant submitted a Certificate of Appreciation for his superior performance \nfrom March 2009 to August 2009 as an interpreter with the Armed Forces and four \nletters of recommendation. A sergeant who worked with Applicant wrote: \n \nIn the course of his duties, [Applicant] was called upon to visit remote and \noften hostile locations in order to converse with the local populace. This \ntask required a high degree of competence and ability to adapt to evolving \nsituations; of which I am able to say that [Applicant] was able to effectively \nprovide through the performance of his duties. (AE C.)   \n \nAnother sergeant with whom Applicant worked from March 2009 to June 2009 \nstated: \n \n[Applicant] served as my personal interpreter during numerous meeting \nlocal Iraqi civil, tribal, and military leaders. During every engagement he \naccurately conveyed not only the words that were spoken but conveyed \nthe tone and emotion of both parties.  [Applicant\u2019s] understanding of the \nnuances of the Arabic language and Iraqi culture proved an invaluable tool \nin building rapport with and influencing these leaders. \n \n[Applicant] is among the most competent interpreters I have had the \nopportunity to work with in my four years of conducting military operations. \n(AE E.) \n \n \nApplicant credibly and sincerely asserted pride in his U.S. citizenship. He is very \ndedicated and enthusiastic about his ability to serve as a linguist for the U.S. military. \nHe testified that \u201cI love this country. I came here. They gave me my life and I\u2019m proud to \n\n \n \n \n \n5\nbe an American citizen and I\u2019ll love this country till the last day of my life. And I will do \nanything to support this country.\u201d (Tr. 104.) \n \nIraq \nI take administrative notice of the following facts: In 2003, The United States led \na coalition to remove Saddam Hussein from power in Iraq. After free elections, Iraq\u2019s \nnew government took office. Despite the elections and new government, Iraq remains \nengulfed in violence, perpetrated by Al Qaeda terrorists and other insurgents. \nNumerous attacks and kidnappings have targeted the U.S. Armed Forces, contractors, \nand other civilians, as well as Iraqis. Even with aggressive governmental action against \nterrorists, the threat of terrorism in Iraq remains high. Terrorist groups conduct \nintelligence activities as effectively as state intelligence services. (HE I, V.) \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the Adjudicative Guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n2(b) and 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d  \n \nAccording to Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to \nestablish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \n\u201capplicant is responsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, \nextenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, \nand has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance \ndecision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \n\n \n \n \n \n6\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline C, Foreign Preference \n \n \nAG \u00b6 9 expresses the security concern related to foreign preference: \n When an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a \nforeign country over the United States, then he or she may be prone to \nprovide information or make decisions that are harmful to the interests of \nthe United States. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 10, two conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case are: \n(a) exercise of any right, privilege or obligation of foreign citizenship after \nbecoming a U.S. citizen or through the foreign citizenship of a family \nmember. This includes but is not limited to: \n(1) possession of a current foreign passport; and \n(b) action to acquire or obtain recognition of a foreign citizenship by an \nAmerican citizen. \nWhen Applicant renewed his Iraqi passport in November 2006 after becoming a \nU.S. citizen in December 2001, he met the conditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 10(a)(1) and 10(b).  \nAfter the Government produced substantial evidence of those two disqualifying \nconditions, the burden shifted to Applicant to produce evidence and prove a mitigating \ncondition. AG \u00b6 11 lists three conditions that may mitigate those security concerns:  \n(b) the individual has expressed a willingness to renounce dual \ncitizenship;  \n\n \n \n \n \n7\n(c) exercise of the rights, privileges, or obligations of foreign citizenship \noccurred before the individual became a U.S. citizen or when the \nindividual was a minor; and  \n(e) the passport has been destroyed, surrendered to the cognizant \nsecurity authority, or otherwise invalidated. \nApplicant expressed his willingness to renounce his Iraqi citizenship and strong \nloyalty to the United States. Applicant\u2019s security office destroyed the Iraqi passport in \nApril 2010.  The evidence supports the application of the referenced mitigating \nconditions. \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for foreign influence is set out in \nAG & 6:       \n \nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual \nhas divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or Government in a \nway that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by \nany foreign interest. Adjudication under this Guideline can and should \nconsider the identity of the foreign county in which the foreign contact or \nfinancial interest is located, including, but not limited to such \nconsiderations as whether the foreign country is known to target United \nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a \nrisk of terrorism. \n \nAG \u00b6 7 describes nine conditions that could raise a security concern, two of \nwhich may be disqualifying in this case: \n \n(a) contact with a foreign family member, business or professional \nassociate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a \nforeign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign \nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion;1 and \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to \nprotect sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s desire to \nhelp a foreign person, group, or country by providing that information. \n                                            \n1 The mere possession of close family ties with a person in a foreign country is not, as a matter of \nlaw, disqualifying under Guideline B. However, if only one relative lives in a foreign country and an \napplicant has contacts with that relative, this factor alone is sufficient to create the potential for foreign \ninfluence and could potentially result in the compromise of classified information. See ISCR Case No. 03-\n02382 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 15, 2006); ISCR Case No. 99-0424 (App. Bd. Feb. 8, 2001). \n \n\n \n \n \n \n8\nApplicant has contact and connections with his parents, brothers and sister, who \nare residents and citizens of Iraq. He acknowledged that these relationships potentially \ncreate a heightened risk of foreign pressure or attempted exploitation because terrorists \nin Iraq are hostile to the U.S. interests and citizens. Applicant\u2019s relationship with his \nfamily members could also create a potential conflict of interest between Applicant\u2019s \n\u201cobligation to protect sensitive information or technology and [his] desire to help\u201d his \nfamily living in Iraq. The evidence is sufficient to raise these potentially disqualifying \nconditions.  \n  \n  \nThree Foreign Influence mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 8 are potentially \napplicable to the disqualifying conditions based on the facts: \n \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nU.S.;   \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country is \nso minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships \nand loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any \nconflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest; and \n \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation. \n \nIn the event terrorists would learn of Applicant\u2019s identity and presence in Iraq, his \nfamily members could be placed in positions that would force him to choose between \nthem and U.S. interests. However, the possibility of that conflict occurring is diminished \nby two factors: Applicant has limited communication with his family members; and other \nthan one brother, none of the family members knew of his work in Iraq because \nApplicant did not disclose it in conformance with employment regulations.  Hence, AG \u00b6 \n8(a) has some application.   \n \nApplicant established the application of AG \u00b6 8(b). Based on his relationship and \ndepth of loyalty to the U.S., he can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in \nfavor of the U.S. interest. He has lived in the United States since 1992. He attended \nschool here. He became a U.S. citizen in 2001. He worked at various jobs for 15 years \nbefore obtaining his current position. Prior to his recent divorce, he owned a home in the \nUnited States. He has bank accounts here. He does not have any financial interests in \nIraq. He currently resides with his former wife, who is a naturalized U.S. citizen. There is \nno evidence that he has connections or contact with people living in Iraq other than his \nimmediate family members. He expressed a strong sense of loyalty to the United States \n\n \n \n \n \n9\nand zeal for his job. His supervisors, who have worked in close contact with him in a \ncombat zone, consider him to be an ethical and dedicated man, and a valuable asset to \nthe U.S. War on Terror. \n \nAG \u00b6 8(c) has some application to the security concerns raised, as Applicant\u2019s \ncontacts with his five siblings are generally infrequent and casual. He telephones them \nevery two or three months. However, he speaks to his parents and one brother every \nmonth. Since leaving Iraq in 1990 as a refugee, he returned to see his family only once, \nin 2006.  \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for personal conduct is set \nout in AG & 15:       \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \nOne Personal Conduct Disqualifying Condition is particularly relevant and \npotentially disqualifying in this case. Guideline \u00b6 16(a) provides that the \u201cdeliberate \nomission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any personnel security \nquestionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to conduct \ninvestigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status, \ndetermine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary \nresponsibilities\u201d may raise a security concern. Applicant incorrectly answered one \nquestion on the March 2008 e-QIP. He denied that he intentionally falsified his answer \nor attempted to deceive the Government.  \nWhen a falsification allegation is controverted or denied, the Government has the \nburden of proving it. Proof of an omission, standing alone, does not establish or prove \nan applicant\u2019s state of mind when the omission occurred. An administrative judge must \nconsider the record evidence as a whole to determine whether there is direct or \ncircumstantial evidence concerning an applicant\u2019s state of mind at the time the omission \noccurred. ISCR Case No. 03-09483 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 17, 2004) (explaining holding in \nISCR Case No. 02-23133 at 5 (App. Bd. Jun. 9, 2004). \nSOR \u00b6 3.a alleged that Applicant falsified the March 2008 e-QIP because he did \nnot disclose that he had obtained an Iraqi passport in November 2006. Applicant \nadmitted the omission, but asserted that he made a mistake by not carefully reviewing \nthe 33-page e-QIP after his employer prepared it for his signature. After listening to his \ntestimony, reviewing the detailed information he revealed during an October 2008 \ninterview regarding that passport, and considering the fact that he left the Iraqi passport \n\n \n \n \n \n10\nwith his brother in December 2006, Applicant\u2019s explanation is credible. His omission \nmay have been negligent, but does not rise to a level of intentional wrongdoing in an \neffort to deceive the Government. Nor does that omission raise questions about his \nreliability or ability to protect classified information. The evidence does not establish \ndeliberate falsification. Accordingly, Guideline E is found in his favor.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility \nfor a security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. The Appeal Board \nrequires the whole-person analysis address \u201cevidence of an applicant\u2019s personal \nloyalties; the nature and extent of an applicant\u2019s family\u2019s ties to the U.S. relative to his \n[or her] ties to a foreign country; his or her social ties within the U.S.; and many others \nraised by the facts of a given case.\u201d ISCR Case No. 04-00540 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan. 5, \n2007).   \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Four circumstances weigh against \nApplicant in the whole-person analysis. First, there is a significant risk of terrorism and \nhuman rights abuses in Iraq. More importantly for security purposes, terrorists in Iraq \nare hostile to the United States and actively seek classified information. Terrorists, and \neven friendly governments, could attempt to use Applicant\u2019s family members to obtain \nsuch information. Second, he had numerous connections to Iraq before he left Iraq as a \nrefugee in 1990. Following his birth, he spent his formative years there. He attended \nhigh school there and served in the Iraqi navy for two years. Third, his parents and six \nsiblings remain residents and citizens of Iraq. Fourth, he maintains some contact with \nthese family members and obtained an Iraqi passport in 2006, in order to visit his sick \nmother and avoid disclosing his U.S. citizenship and jeopardize his safety. \n \n Substantial mitigating evidence weighs in favor of granting Applicant a security \nclearance. He is a mature person, who has lived in the United States for 17 years, and \n\n \n \n \n \n11\nhas been a naturalized citizen since 2001. His former spouse (with whom he still \nresides) has been living in the United States since 2003 and is a naturalized citizen. He \nowned property here and has a bank account. After leaving Iraq in 1990, he did not \nreturn until November 2006, when he visited his sick mother. The next time he returned \nwas in December 2008 as a translator. His ties to the United States are stronger than \nhis ties to family members living in Iraq. There is no evidence that he has ever taken \nany action that could cause potential harm to the United States. He takes his loyalty to \nthe United States seriously. In his employment with a defense contractor, he provided \nvital and direct support to the U.S. Armed Forces from December 2008 until August \n2009.  He worked diligently and courageously in an important capacity, which resulted \nin a serious physical injury. His supervisors assessed him as loyal, trustworthy, \nconscientious, and responsible. They praised his dedication and capabilities. While \nworking in Iraq, he did not have any physical contact with his family. There is no \nderogatory information about him in the record.  \n \nApplicant held an interim security clearance during his work with the U.S. Armed \nForces without any indication that he breached security policies or procedures. While \nthat fact is not normally to be considered a factor in granting a clearance, the Appeal \nBoard noted in ISCR Case No. 05-03846 (App. Bd. Nov.14, 2006) as follows: \n \nAs a general rule, Judges are not required to assign an applicant\u2019s prior \nhistory of complying with security procedures and regulations significant \nprobative value for purposes of refuting, mitigating, or extenuating the \nsecurity concerns raised by the applicant\u2019s more immediate disqualifying \nconduct or circumstances. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 01-03357 at 4 (App. \nBd. Dec. 13, 2005); ISCR Case No. 02-10113 at 5 (App. Bd. Mar. 25, \n2005); ISCR Case No. 03-10955 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 30, 2006). \nHowever, the Board has recognized an exception to that general rule in \nGuideline B cases, where the applicant has established by credible, \nindependent evidence that his compliance with security procedures and \nregulations occurred in the context of dangerous, high-risk circumstances \nin which the applicant had made a significant contribution to the national \nsecurity. See, e.g. ISCR Case No. 04-12363 at 2 (App. Bd. July 14, 2006). \nThe presence of such circumstances can give credibility to an applicant\u2019s \nassertion that he can be relied upon to recognize, resist, and report a \nforeign power\u2019s attempts at coercion or exploitation. \n \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, and all facts and \ncircumstances in the context of the whole-person, I conclude Applicant mitigated the \nsecurity concerns pertaining to foreign preference and foreign influence. Overall, the \nrecord evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and \nsuitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude that Applicant \nmitigated the foreign preference and foreign influence security concerns, and that the \nrecord does not contain sufficient evidence to raise a personal conduct security \nconcern. \n \n\n \n \n \n \n12\nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline C:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a (1) through 1.a.(3):   For Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline B:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a through 2.c:  \nFor Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 3, Guideline E:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 3.a:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n \n                                           \n     \n \n \n \n \n_________________ \nSHARI DAM \nAdministrative Judge \n",

On September 9, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) \nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under Guideline F \n(financial considerations) for Applicant. The action was taken under Executive Order \n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and \nthe adjudicative guidelines (AG) effective within the Department of Defense for SORs \nafter September 1, 2006.  \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on November 25, 2009, and DOHA received her \nanswer on November 30, 2009. Department Counsel was prepared to proceed on \nJuly 28, 2010\n\n \n2 \n \n \nMay 26, 2010. The case was assigned to me on May 28, 2010. DOHA issued a notice \nof hearing on June 4, 2010, scheduling the hearing for June 29, 2010. The hearing \nwas held as scheduled. \n \nThe Government offered Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 6, which were \nreceived without objection. The Applicant offered Applicant Exhibits (AE) A through L, \nwhich were received without objection, and she testified on her own behalf. DOHA \nreceived the hearing transcript (Tr.) on July 7, 2010. The record closed on July 7, \n2010. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant admitted all of the SOR allegations with explanations. Her answers \nwith explanations are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a thorough review \nof the evidence, I make the following additional findings of fact. \n \nBackground Information \n \nApplicant is a 48-year-old lead dispatcher, who has worked for her defense \ncontractor employer since January 2008. She currently has an interim secret \nclearance. Successfully vetting for a security clearance is a requirement for her \ncontinued employment. (GE 1, AE I, AE J, Tr. 20, 28-29, 48.)  \n \nApplicant immigrated to the U.S. from Germany when she was 13 years old. \nShe did not graduate from high school, but did attend a vocational school and earn her \nGeneral Educational Development certificate in approximately 1986. While attending \nvocational school, she took secretarial courses. She later attended a community \ncollege to pursue a course of study in physical therapy, but did not complete the \nprogram. (GE 1, Tr. 26-28.)  \n \nApplicant is in her third marriage. She was married to her first husband from \nMarch 1986 to July 1987, which ended by divorce. She was married to her second \nhusband from June 1988 to December 1997, which ended by divorce. She married \nher third and current husband in January 1998, separated in December 2008, and is \npending divorce. She and her third husband have a 12-year-old son. Applicant has \ncustody of their son and receives approximately $800 in monthly child support by \ninformal arrangement. She has a 19-year-old daughter from her second marriage, who \nlives with her father. Applicant also has two stepsons from her current husband\u2019s first \nmarriage. (GE 1, 20-26.)  \n \nIn February 2010, Applicant was diagnosed with breast cancer. She had \nsurgery on April 1, 2010 and remained on sick leave until May 1, 2010. Applicant was \nscheduled to begin chemotherapy treatment the day after her hearing. (Tr. 34-37.) \nShe also was unemployed from December 2006 to January 2008, which ended when \nshe began her current job. (GE 1, Tr. 40-41.) \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \nFinancial Considerations \n \nApplicant\u2019s background investigation addressed her financial situation and \nincluded the review of her July 2008 SF-86, her May 2009 Responses to DOHA \nInterrogatories, as well as her July 2008, May 2009, and June 2010 credit reports. \nApplicant\u2019s SOR identified eight separate debts totaling $16,115. (GE 1 \u2013 6; SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.a. \u2013 1.h.) \n \nApplicant has settled, paid, or otherwise resolved the eight debts alleged. A \nbrief summary of each debt follows. The debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a. is a collection \naccount for an education loan in the amount of $424. Applicant settled this account for \n$212, which she paid in November 2009. (AE A, Tr. 39-40.) \n \nThe debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b. is a past-due account for a medical bill in the \namount of $25. Applicant paid this account in full in June 2010. (AE B, Tr. 40.) \n \nThe debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.c. is a past-due credit card account in the amount \nof $711. Applicant settled this account for a lesser amount and made a final payment \nof $178 in May 2009. (AE C, Tr. 40-42.)  \n \nThe debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.d. is a collection account for a computer she \npurchased for $3,020. Applicant made payment arrangements to pay the creditor $100 \nmonthly. She is current on her monthly payments. (AE D, Tr. 42.)  \n \nThe debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.e. is a collection account for cell phone service in \nthe amount of $1,079. Applicant settled this account with the creditor for $647, and \nmade her last payment of $497 in July 2010. (AE E, Tr. 43.) \n \nThe debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.f. is a collection account for cell phone service \n(different company than debt in SOR \u00b6 1.e.) in the amount of $111. Applicant settled \nthis account for $48, which she paid in July 2010. (AE F, Tr. 43-45.)  \n \nThe debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.g. is a collection account for telephone service in \nthe amount of $250. Applicant settled this account for $125, which she paid in June \n2009. (AE G, Tr. 45.) \n \nThe debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.h. is for a past-due student loan in the amount of \n$10,495. This debt was repaid by recoupment of federal income tax refunds owed to \nApplicant. As of June 2010, Applicant no longer had a balance due on this account. \n(AE H, Tr. 45-46.) \n \nApplicant attributes her financial problems to a combination of factors to include \nher husband\u2019s injury and her family\u2019s forced relocation following a hurricane, her \nrecent diagnosis of breast cancer and uncovered medical expenses, and her \nunemployment before beginning her current job. However, the most significant factor \n\n \n4 \n \n \naffecting her current financial situation was the reduction of income following her \nseparation from her husband. (Response to SOR, Tr. 32, 34-36, 38, 44, 50.) \n \nIn conclusion, Applicant has paid, settled, made good-faith efforts to repay \noverdue creditors, or resolved all debts alleged. Applicant remains current on the rest \nof her monthly bills. Her budget further demonstrates that she maintains a modest \nlifestyle and is living within her means. (AE L, Tr. 29-33, 46-49.) \n \nCharacter Evidence \n \nApplicant submitted three reference letters. Two of those letters are from the \nmanager who hired her and her current supervisor. Both individuals enthusiastically \ncommend Applicant\u2019s performance as lead dispatcher, a position to which she was \npromoted to January 2009. They describe her as \u201ca highly valued part of the \nEmergency Management Team\u201d and as a \u201cproven . . . professional and dedicated \nmember of the (command) Dispatch team.\u201d She supervises a ten-person contractor \ndispatch team with great skill and dedication. Her supervisor described her as \u201chonest, \ndependable and a very capable person, skillfully handling a myriad of both personal \nand professional circumstances.\u201d Applicant is entrusted with many personal and \nintimate details of each dispatcher, which she has never compromised. (AE I, AE J.) \n \nApplicant\u2019s last letter was a personal reference from a long-time family friend, \nwho is a medical doctor. He described Applicant\u2019s role as a mother as well as her \ninvolvement in the community. She was the director of the local cheerleading league \nand organized the teams, scheduled competitive events, and ran fundraising events to \nbuy uniforms. She also volunteered for the Special Olympics and other organizations. \nHe added that his handicapped daughter is a good friend of Applicant\u2019s daughter and \nhas spent a significant amount of time at Applicant\u2019s home over the years. He \nconcluded by saying that Applicant is \u201ca person of integrity, honesty, dependability, \nand honor.\u201d (AE K.) \n \nPolicies \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory \nexplanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying \nconditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s \neligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \n\n \n5 \n \n \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 \n2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion in seeking to obtain a favorable \nsecurity decision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration \nof the possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \n  \nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all \nappropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, including those described briefly \nabove, I conclude that a relevant security concern exists under Guideline F (financial \nconsiderations). AG \u00b6 18 articulates the security concern relating to financial \nproblems: \n \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds. \n\n \n6 \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 19 provides two financial considerations disqualifying conditions that \ncould raise a security concern and may be disqualifying in this case: \u201c(a) inability or \nunwillingness to satisfy debts,\u201d and \u201c(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d \nApplicant\u2019s history of delinquent debt is established by her admissions and the \nevidence presented. As indicated in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. to 1.h., she had eight delinquent \ndebts totaling $16,115 that were in various states of delinquency for several years. \nThe Government established the disqualifying conditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c).   \n \n  \nFive financial considerations mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a) through \n(e) are potentially applicable:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), \nand \nthe \nindividual \nacted \nresponsibly \nunder \nthe \ncircumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control; \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \nApplicant\u2019s conduct does not warrant full application of AG \u00b6 20(a) because \nthere is more than one delinquent debt and her financial problems are not isolated. It \nwas not until recently that these debts were paid or resolved. Therefore, her debts are \n\u201ca continuing course of conduct\u201d under the Appeal Board\u2019s jurisprudence. See ISCR \nCase No. 07-11814 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 29, 2008) (citing ISCR Case No. 01-03695 \n(App. Bd. Oct. 16, 2002)). She receives partial credit under AG \u00b6 20(a) because the \ndebt \u201coccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d Under \nAG \u00b6 20(b), she receives full credit because the hardship caused by a hurricane to her \nfamily, her unemployment, her diagnosis and costs associated with breast cancer, and \n\n \n7 \n \n \n                                                          \nher separation and pending divorce were largely beyond her control and she acted \nresponsibly under the circumstances.1  \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c) is not applicable because Applicant did not seek financial \ncounseling. She has, however, produced evidence that establishes that she is living \nwithin her means and has regained financial responsibility. Furthermore, there is \nsufficient information to establish full mitigation under AG \u00b6 20(d).2 Applicant has paid, \nis paying, or has otherwise resolved her debts. AG \u00b6 20(e) is not applicable because \nApplicant did not dispute the legitimacy of any of her debts.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the \napplicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should \nconsider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the \nmotivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, \nexploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence.  \n \n1\u201cEven if Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances outside \nhis [or her] control, the Judge could still consider whether Applicant has since acted in a reasonable \nmanner when dealing with those financial difficulties.\u201d ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. Bd. Jan. \n12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 at 4 \n(App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). A component is \nwhether she maintained contact with her creditors and attempted to negotiate partial payments to keep \nher debts current. \n \n2The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a \u201cgood-faith\u201d effort to repay overdue \ncreditors or otherwise resolve debts: \n \nIn order to qualify for application of [the \u201cgood-faith\u201d mitigating condition], an applicant \nmust present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \nsome other good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant\u2019s debts. The Directive \ndoes not define the term \u2018good-faith.\u2019 However, the Board has indicated that the \nconcept of good-faith \u2018requires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows \nreasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.\u2019 Accordingly, \nan applicant must do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally available \noption in order to claim the benefit of [the \u201cgood-faith\u201d mitigating condition].  \n \n(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2004) (quoting \nISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 4, 2001)). \n\n \n8 \n \n \nThe ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance must \nbe an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nguidelines and the whole-person concept. AG \u00b6 2(c).  \nThere is evidence against mitigating Applicant\u2019s conduct. The SOR lists eight \ndebts totalling $16,115 that were at one time or another in various states of \ndelinquency. Her lack of success in resolving delinquent debt until recently raises \nsufficient security concerns to merit further inquiry.   \n \nThe mitigating evidence under the whole-person concept is more substantial. \nApplicant\u2019s record of community involvement and good employment weighs in her \nfavor. There is no evidence of any security violation during the time Applicant held her \ninterim security clearance. She is a law-abiding citizen. All of her SOR debts are paid \nor resolved. Her monthly expenses are current. The Appeal Board has addressed a \nkey element in the whole-person analysis in financial cases, stating: \n \nIn evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the \nconcept of \u201c\u2018meaningful track record\u2019\u201d necessarily includes evidence of \nactual debt reduction through payment of debts.\u201d However, an applicant \nis not required, as a matter of law, to establish that [she] has paid off \neach and every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an \napplicant demonstrate that [she] has \u201c. . . established a plan to resolve \n[her] financial problems and taken significant actions to implement that \nplan.\u201d The Judge can reasonably consider the entirety of an applicant\u2019s \nfinancial situation and [her] actions in evaluating the extent to which that \napplicant\u2019s plan for the reduction of [her] outstanding indebtedness is \ncredible and realistic. See Directive \u00b6  E2.2(a) (\u201cAvailable, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, should be considered in reaching a determination.\u201d) There \nis no requirement that a plan provide for payments on all outstanding \ndebts simultaneously. Rather, a reasonable plan (and concomitant \nconduct) may provide for the payment of such debts one at a time. \nLikewise, there is no requirement that the first debts actually paid in \nfurtherance of a reasonable debt plan be the ones listed in the SOR. \n \nISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008) (internal citations omitted). \nApplicant is making a significant contribution to the national defense. Her company \nfully supports her and recommends her for a security clearance. She made mistakes, \nand debts became delinquent. There is, however, simply no reason not to trust her. \nHer reference letters substantiate her good character. She has paid her debts. \nFurthermore, she has established a \u201cmeaningful track record\u201d of debt payments. \nThese factors show responsibility, rehabilitation, and mitigation. After weighing the \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions, and all the facts and circumstances in the \ncontext of the whole person, I conclude she has mitigated the financial considerations \nsecurity concerns.  \n \n\n \n9 \n \n \nI take this position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. \nEgan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988), my careful consideration of the whole person factors and \nsupporting evidence, my application of the pertinent factors under the adjudicative \nprocess, and my interpretation of my responsibilities under the adjudicative guidelines. \nApplicant has fully mitigated or overcome the Government\u2019s case. For the reasons \nstated, I conclude she is eligible for access to classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the \nSOR, as required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:   \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a. to 1.h.: \n For Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility \nfor a security clearance. Eligibility for a security clearance is granted. \n \n \n \n____________________________ \nRobert J. Tuider \nAdministrative Judge \n \n \n \n \n",

Edmunds, Esquire \n \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nHOWE, Philip S., Administrative Judge: \n \nOn April 1, 2008, Applicant submitted her Security Clearance Application (SF \n86). On August 10, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued \nApplicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under Guideline B \n(Foreign Influence). The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of \nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines \n(AG) effective within the Department of Defense on September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on September 9, 2009. She \nanswered the SOR in writing on or before September 11, 2009, and requested a \ndecision without a hearing. DOHA received the request on September 11, 2009. On or \nabout October 2009, Applicant changed her selection and decided to have a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge. Department Counsel was prepared to proceed on \nJanuary 7, 2010, and I received the case assignment on January 13, 2010. DOHA \nissued a Notice of Hearing on January 29, 2010, and I convened the hearing as \n \n1 \n \n \nJuly 1, 2010\n\n \n2 \n \n \nscheduled on February 22, 2010. The Government offered Exhibits 1 through 3, which \nwere received without objection. Exhibit 3, the request for administrative notice of \ndocuments pertaining to the People\u2019s Republic of China, consists of 15 subparts \n(Attachments I through XV). Applicant testified. Her attorney submitted Exhibits A \nthrough E, without objection. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on March \n4, 2010. Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, \neligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \nProcedural and Evidentiary Rulings \n \nRequest for Administrative Notice \n \nDepartment Counsel submitted a formal request that I take administrative notice \nof certain facts relating to the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC). (Tr. at 10-12.) The \nrequest and the attached documents were admitted into evidence as Hearing Exhibit 3. \nThe facts administratively noticed are set out in the Findings of Fact, below.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn her Answer to the SOR Applicant admitted the factual allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a to \n1.d  and \u00b6\u00b6 1.f to 1.j of the SOR, with explanations. She denied the factual allegations in \n\u00b6 1.e of the SOR.

She works for a government contractor. \nApplicant became a U.S. citizen in 1998 and has a U.S. passport. Her last trip to the \nPRC was in 2000 and she has no present plans to travel there in the future.  Her mother \nvisited her in the United States in 2005, and her father visited her in 2008. She does not \nspeak to her mother because of some past conflict. She communicates with her father \nabout once every two months by telephone. Her husband was born in the PRC. He lives \nin the United States and is a U.S. citizen. He works for a local energy company. She \nand her husband own a home in the United States and their combined income exceeds \n$150,000 annually. Applicant expressed her loyalty to the United States. (Tr. 14-18, 25-\n27, 31, 37; Exhibit E) \n \n \nApplicant was born in 1968. She came alone to the United States in 1985 after \nhigh school graduation to attend college here. Her father wanted her to study in the \nUnited States and to live here. Applicant graduated from college in 1991 with a \nbachelor\u2019s degree. She attended another U.S. university and obtained another \nbachelor\u2019s degree in 1994. (Tr. 28-30, 41-44) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s parents live and work in the PRC. They were born there and are \ncitizens of the PRC. They are members of the Communist Party in the PRC.  Applicant \nvoluntarily disclosed her parent\u2019s political party memberships. Applicant was never a \nmember of the Communist Party when she lived in the PRC. According to Applicant\u2019s \n\n \n3 \n \n \nexplanation, her parents joined the Communist Party as a means to obtain a better job \nand an improved income. Both parents worked at PRC universities and are now retired, \nreceiving a pension from the PRC government. Her parents do not have access to any \ninformation or governmental connection in their retirement status. Her parents do not \nknow of Applicant\u2019s work for her employer. (Tr. 17-19, 24, 25, 33; Exhibits 1, 2) \n \n \nApplicant has an uncle who is a university professor living in the PRC. She \nspeaks with him once a year. She also has an aunt who is a member of the Communist \nParty and lives in the PRC. Applicant speaks with her once a year. Applicant told the \ngovernment investigator that her aunt has no affiliation with a foreign government. (Tr. \n21; Exhibits 1, 2) \n \n \nApplicant had two brothers who were twins. One died several years ago as a \ncrime victim. The other brother is a banker in the PRC. He is not a member of the \nCommunist Party. Applicant explained her brother did not need to join the Communist \nParty to gain economic advancement in the modern PRC. She speaks to him only once \nevery few months over the telephone. (Tr. 20, 33, 34; Exhibits 1, 2)  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s mother-in-law lives in the PRC. She lives in a rural community. She is \nnot a member of the Communist Party. Applicant has never met her and has no contact \nwith her. (Tr. 37; Exhibits 1, 2)  \n \n \nApplicant submitted two favorable personal and employment references. She \nalso submitted her June 2008 employee evaluation showing rankings in all categories of \n\u201cabove average.\u201d This evaluation was her 90-day performance evaluation. (Exhibits A-\nD) \n \n \nI take administrative notice of the following facts concerning the PRC. The PRC \nis a one-party Communist totalitarian state. It has an economy growing at 10% annually, \nand expanding military forces, including its naval forces. It engages in industrial and \nmilitary espionage on a regular basis against the United States and other countries. The \nUnited States and the PRC have been rivals since 1948, when the Communists took \ncontrol of mainland China, and the Nationalist government fled to the island of Taiwan.  \nTaiwan remains an issue of contention between the two countries. The U.S. - China \nEconomic and Security Review Commission=s 2006 report to the U.S. Congress found \nthe PRC has a large and aggressive intelligence gathering operation in the United \nStates, particularly in the scientific and military fields. The PRC engages regularly in \nmilitary, economic, and industrial espionage, including stealing nuclear weapons \ntechnology, missile design information, and commercial technology. The PRC also \nobtains commercial information through the use of front companies, buying dual-use \ntechnologies, and the direct collection of technology by non-intelligence agencies and \nindividuals. The People\u2019s Liberation Army (PLA) is integrated into the civil industrial \nbase in the PRC, known as the \u201cdigital triangle.\u201d The 2007 Report to Congress of the \nU.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission (Exhibit 3, Attachment V at \npage 102) states the linkages between the military and Chinese commercial information \ntechnology companies and the \u201cstate R&D institute\u201d are longstanding, \u201cas \n\n \n4 \n \n \ntelecommunications and information technology in China were originally under military \nauspices and the commercial relationships with state and military research institutes \nremain important.\u201d  Additionally, the U.S. State Department reported the PRC has a \npoor human rights record, including but not limited to, denial of free speech and press, \nfair and open trials, and other basic rights recognized by the international community.  It \nalso suppresses political dissent, using arbitrary arrests, forced confessions, and \nmistreatment of prisoners as part of its operational methods to maintain control of its \npopulation. (Exhibit 3 and its Attachments I to XV) \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information.  Decisions include, by necessity, consideration \nof the possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \n\n \n5 \n \n \n                                                          \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n Section 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \n \nAG & 6 expresses the security concern pertaining to foreign influence:  \n \nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual \nhas divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by \nany foreign interest. Adjudication under this Guideline can and should \nconsider the identity of the foreign county in which the foreign contact or \nfinancial interest is located, including, but not limited to such \nconsiderations as whether the foreign country is known to target United \nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a \nrisk of terrorism. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 7. Two are potentially applicable in this case: \n \n(a) contact with a foreign family member, business or professional \nassociate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a \nforeign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign \nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion;1 and \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to \nprotect sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s desire to \nhelp a foreign person, group, or country by providing that information. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s mother, father, brother, aunt, and uncle are citizens and residents of \nthe PRC. She does not contact her mother because they have a personality conflict. \nShe speaks with her father monthly. She contacts her brother periodically. Applicant \n \n1 The mere possession of close family ties with a person in a foreign country is not, as a matter of law, \ndisqualifying under Guideline B. However, if only one relative lives in a foreign country and an applicant \nhas contacts with that relative, this factor alone is sufficient to create the potential for foreign influence \nand could potentially result in the compromise of classified information. See ISCR Case No. 03-02382 at \n5 (App. Bd. Feb. 15, 2006); ISCR Case No. 99-0424 (App. Bd. Feb. 8, 2001). \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \nannually contacts her aunt and uncle. These contacts create a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion because they are \nmade with persons living in a Communist dictatorship that has a history of economic \nand military espionage against the United States. It also creates a potential conflict of \ninterest if Applicant were approached by any of her relatives to obtain information from \nApplicant on behalf of the PRC government. Applicant would have to choose between \nher loyalty to the United States and her relatives. AG \u00b6 7(a) and (b) have been raised by \nthe evidence. \n \n \nThe Government produced substantial evidence of those two disqualifying \nconditions, and the burden shifted to Applicant to produce evidence and prove \nmitigation.  Two conditions that could mitigate the disqualifications are provided \nunder AG \u00b6 8:  \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country is \nso minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships \nand loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any \nconflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest; and \n \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation. \n \nApplicant established the application of AG \u00b6 8(b) and 8(c). The evidence \npresented at the hearing showed the true nature of her connections to her family and \nher substantial personal investment in her life in the United States.  \n \nApplicant showed sufficient evidence and a persuasive presentation that her \nloyalty to the U.S. is paramount over her connections to any members of her family in \nthe PRC. She has been in the United States for 24 years, longer than her first 16 years \nin the PRC as she was growing up. She obtained her education in the United States, \nowns property in the United States, and her children, ages 6 and 8,  were born in the \nUnited States. She and her husband became U.S. citizens and residents. Applicant \nowns a home in the United States, earns a very good salary and with her husband\u2019s \nincome they earn more than $150,000 annually. When Applicant became a citizen in \n1998, she renounced her PRC citizenship. She has not travelled to the PRC for 10 \nyears and has no plans to travel there in the future.  \n \nThere is no risk of exploitation or influence because of these tangential familial \nconnections when balanced with Applicant\u2019s substantial economic, educational, and \nimmediate family connections to the United States. Therefore, she can be expected to \nresolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interests, \n \n Her relationship with her mother and brother are casual or infrequent because \nApplicant has no contact with her mother and only quarterly contact with her brother. \n\n \n7 \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s relationship with her father is closer and more regular. Her parent\u2019s \nmembership in the PRC Communist Party is problematic, but they are retired from their \nuniversity professorial positions and have no contact with the university or the PRC \ngovernment in their retirement status.  Her brother is not a member of the Communist \nParty.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of an applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 2(c) requires each case must be judged on its own merits.  Under AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance \nmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nguidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant came to the United States \nwhen she was 16 years old. She has been living here since then, obtaining two college \ndegrees, marrying, having two children, and buying a house. She has limited contact \nwith family members in the PRC, speaking only to her father, and that once a month. \nShe has not seen him since 2008. The last time she visited PRC was in 2000. Applicant \nis strongly committed to the United States and her life here. She has been a U.S. citizen \nfor 12 years and remains in the United States instead of traveling to the PRC. There is \nno potential for pressure or coercion by the PRC against Applicant.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant mitigated the security concerns arising from her foreign influence \nsecurity concerns. I conclude the \u201cwhole-person\u201d concept for Applicant.  \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n8 \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.e:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.f:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.g:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.h:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.i:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.j:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

He did not provide proof of any payments, or corroborating documentation of \nany SOR debt resolution. He failed to make sufficient effort to resolve his delinquent \nSOR debts. Financial considerations concerns are not mitigated. Eligibility for access to \nclassified information is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn October 8, 2008, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaires for \nInvestigations Processing (SF 86) (Item 5). On August 19, 2009, the Defense Office of \nHearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued an SOR to Applicant (Item 1), pursuant to \nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry, dated \nFebruary 20, 1960, as amended and modified; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, \nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive), dated \nJanuary 2, 1992, as amended and modified; and the revised adjudicative guidelines \n(AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005.  \n \nMarch 30, 2010\n\n \n2 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                           \nThe SOR alleged security concerns under Guideline F (financial considerations) \n(Item 1). The SOR detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary \naffirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant, and recommended \nreferral to an administrative judge to determine whether Applicant\u2019s clearance should be \ngranted, continued, denied, or revoked (Item 1). \n \nOn September 10, 2009, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations, and \nrequested a hearing (Item 2). On October 13, 2009, the case was scheduled for a \nhearing; however, Applicant requested a continuance. Administrative Judge Crean \ndenied the request for a continuance. Department Counsel orally notified Applicant that \nthe request for delay was denied, and the hearing would be held as scheduled on \nOctober 19, 2009 (Item 4). Applicant did not appear at the hearing. Applicant \nsubsequently requested a decision on the record, which Administrative Judge Crean \ngranted (Item 4).    \n \nA complete copy of the file of relevant material (FORM), dated December 24, \n2009, was provided to him on January 12, 2010, and he was afforded an opportunity to \nfile objections and to submit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation.1 Applicant \ndid not respond to the FORM. The case was assigned to me on March 7, 2010. \n \nFindings of Fact2 \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s response to the SOR, he admitted responsibility for the three debts \nin SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, and 1.d (Items 1, 2).3 He also described why he did not resolve \nsome of his debts. His admissions are accepted as findings of fact. After a complete \nand thorough review of the evidence of record, I make the following additional findings \nof fact.   \n \nApplicant is a 43-year-old employee of a defense contractor.4 His position title is \nindividual training specialist. He received a bachelor of science degree in June 1997. In \n2006 he married, and he was divorced in 2008. His children were born in 1991 and \n1995. He served in the Army from March 1987 to the present.    \n \nApplicant did not disclose any unpaid liens, garnishments, debt currently over 90 \ndays delinquent, debt over 180 days delinquent in the last seven years, illegal drug use, \n \n1The DOHA transmittal letter is dated December 29, 2009; and Applicant\u2019s receipt is dated \nJanuary 12, 2010 (file). The DOHA transmittal letter informed Applicant that he had 30 days after his \nreceipt to submit information (file).  \n \n2Some details have not been included in order to protect Applicant\u2019s right to privacy. Specific \ninformation is available in the cited exhibits. \n  \n3Unless stated otherwise, the facts in this paragraph and the next paragraph are from Applicant\u2019s \nSeptember 10, 2009, SOR response (Item 2). \n \n4Unless stated otherwise, the facts in this paragraph and the next paragraph are from Applicant\u2019s \nOctober 8, 2008, SF 86 (Item 5). \n\n \n3 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \nor alcohol-related offenses on his October 8, 2008, security clearance application. He \ndisclosed that a sexual assault charge was dismissed in 2002, and the record of the \ncharge was expunged.  \n \nFinancial Considerations \n \nAn Office of Personnel Management (OPM) investigator interviewed Applicant on \nNovember 13, 2008 (Item 6). The OPM investigator reviewed the SOR debts with \nApplicant. Applicant asserted that he was separated from his fianc\u00e9e and then wife for a \ntime, and she was receiving the bills, which she did not pay (Item 6). In 2008, they were \ndivorced (Item 6). \n \nOn June 1, 2009, Applicant completed a personal financial statement (PFS) (Item \n7 at 4). His monthly gross salary is $4,188. His monthly net salary is $2,956. His \nmonthly expenses are $1,870. His monthly debt payments total $760. His net remainder \nis $826. None of the SOR debts are listed as a financial obligation on his PFS. \nApplicant\u2019s SOR lists six delinquent debts totaling $32,712. A detailed description of the \nstatus of those debts follows: \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.a ($192)\u2014DEBT UNRESOLVED. On September 5, 2009, Applicant \nsaid this account was transferred, and he is in the process of contacting the new \ncreditor concerning the debt (Item 2 at 1). On January 12, 2010, Applicant was served \nwith the FORM and notified he had 30 days to provide updated information. He did not \nprovide an update about resolution of this debt.  \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.b ($14,867)\u2014DEBT UNRESOLVED. On September 5, 2009, Applicant \nsaid he and his wife were mutually responsible for this debt. He stated, \u201cThis debt was \ncontested due to divorce agreement that entitles her to the vehicle. This debt is \ncurrently going through litigation proceedings to counter it\u2019s legitimacy\u201d (Item 2 at 1). On \nJanuary 12, 2010, Applicant was served with the FORM and notified he had 30 days to \nprovide updated information. He did not provide an update about resolution of this debt. \nHe did not provide a copy of his divorce decree or any other documentation showing the \ndispute of this debt. \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.c ($15,490)\u2014DEBT UNRESOLVED. Applicant\u2019s vehicle was \nrepossessed in 2002 (FORM at 3; Item 6 at 3-4; Item 8 at 5). There were two settlement \noffers; however, there is no evidence of acceptance and payments (FORM at 4). On \nJune 1, 2009, Applicant said he asked for more information from the creditor and was \nwaiting for the creditor to further decrease their settlement offer (Item 7 at 5). On \nSeptember 5, 2009, Applicant provided a copy of a September 2, 2009, settlement offer \nfrom the creditor seeking $1,566 in a lump sum, or payments of $10 per month (Item 2 \nat 3). The offer expired on September 30, 2009 (Item 2 at 3). On January 12, 2010, \nApplicant was served with the FORM and notified he had 30 days to provide updated \ninformation. He did not provide an update about resolution of this debt.  \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.d ($257)\u2014DEBT UNRESOLVED. On September 5, 2009, Applicant \nadmitted responsibility for the debt; however, he said this account was transferred (Item \n\n \n4 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n2 at 2).

On September 5, 2009, Applicant said this \naccount was disputed. Applicant said a telecommunications debt was generated in \n1998. He unsuccessfully attempted to have it removed from his credit report (Item 2 at \n2). On January 12, 2010, Applicant was served with the FORM and notified he had 30 \ndays to provide updated information. He did not provide any correspondence to or from \nthe creditor or update the status of the resolution of this debt.  \n \nThe FORM cites lack of documentation showing disputed debts, payments, and \nfinancial counseling, placing Applicant on notice of what he needed to do to alleviate or \nmitigate security concerns. The file does not contain any documentary evidence that \ndebts are paid, disputed, in established payment plans, or that Applicant has received \nfinancial counseling.  \n  \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the \nExecutive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security \nemphasizing, \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. \nEgan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the \nauthority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine \nwhether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. \nat 527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.    \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not \ninflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  \n \nThe government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \n\n \n5 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. Clearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. \nOr. 10865 \u00a7 7. See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), Section 3. Thus, \nnothing in this Decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, \nin whole or in part, on any express or implied determination as to applicant\u2019s allegiance, \nloyalty, or patriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict \nguidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a \nclearance. \n \nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).      \n \nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of \ndisproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the government. See ISCR Case No. \n02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, \nif they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).   \n \nAnalysis \n \n  \nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all \nappropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, I conclude the relevant security \nconcern is under Guideline F (financial considerations).  \n \nFinancial Considerations \n \n  \nAG \u00b6 18 articulates the security concern relating to financial problems: \n \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \n\n \n6 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds. \n  \nAG \u00b6 19 provides two Financial Considerations Disqualifying Conditions that \ncould raise a security concern and may be disqualifying in this case: \u201c(a) inability or \nunwillingness to satisfy debts;\u201d and \u201c(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d In \nISCR Case No. 08-12184 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan. 7, 2010), the Appeal Board explained: \n \nIt is well-settled that adverse information from a credit report can normally \nmeet the substantial evidence standard and the government\u2019s obligations \nunder [Directive] \u00b6 E3.1.14 for pertinent allegations. At that point, the \nburden shifts to applicant to establish either that [he or] she is not \nresponsible for the debt or that matters in mitigation apply. \n \n(internal citation omitted). Applicant\u2019s history of delinquent debt is documented in his \ncredit reports, responses to interrogatories, Office of Personnel Management interview, \nand his SOR response. His six delinquent SOR debts total $32,712. One debt became \ndelinquent in 1998, and has not been resolved. One creditor offered to settle a debt for \n10% of the amount owed, and Applicant did not take action to accept the settlement and \npay the debt. The government established the disqualifying conditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) \nand 19(c). Additional inquiry about the possible applicability of mitigating conditions is \nrequired.   \n \n  \nFive Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control; \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n\n \n7 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                           \nApplicant\u2019s conduct does not warrant full application of any mitigating conditions \nbecause he did not act more aggressively and responsibly to resolve his delinquent \ndebts. His delinquent debts are \u201ca continuing course of conduct\u201d under the Appeal \nBoard\u2019s jurisprudence. See ISCR Case No. 07-11814 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 29, 2008) \n(citing ISCR Case No. 01-03695 (App. Bd. Oct. 16, 2002)). Applicant does not receive \ncredit under AG \u00b6 20(a) because he did not establish that his financial problems \n\u201coccurred under such circumstances that [they are] unlikely to recur.\u201d There is some \nresidual doubt about whether Applicant is fully committed to resolving his delinquent \nSOR debts and is making adequate steps to do so.  \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b) partially applies. Applicant\u2019s financial situation was damaged by his \nfianc\u00e9e and then spouse\u2019s failure to pay the family debts, when she was in a position to \ndo so. In 2008, he was divorced. However, there is insufficient evidence about these \ncircumstances to show their effect on his financial situation, and that he acted \nresponsibly under the circumstances. There is insufficient evidence he maintained \ncontact with his creditors on several of his SOR debts.5 Once he learned of his \ndelinquent debts at his OPM interview on November 13, 2008, his documented actions \nwere insufficient to establish he acted responsibly under the circumstances.     \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c) does not apply. He did not receive financial counseling. Applicant \nprovided a PFS or budget, and he understands from the FORM what he must do to \nestablish his financial responsibility. Applicant cannot receive full credit under AG \u00b6 \n20(c) because he has not paid, established payment plans (by making payments), \nadequately documented disputes of debts, or otherwise resolved any of his SOR debts. \nThere are some initial, positive \u201cindications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control.\u201d He has admitted responsibility for three SOR debts, and documented his \ncommunication with one of them. He also established some mitigation under AG \u00b6 20(d) \nby showing some good faith6 in the resolution of his SOR debts by admitting \n \n5\u201cEven if Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances \noutside his [or her] control, the Judge could still consider whether Applicant has since acted in a \nreasonable manner when dealing with those financial difficulties.\u201d ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. \nBd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 \nat 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). A component is \nwhether he or she maintained contact with creditors and attempted to negotiate partial payments to keep \ndebts current. \n \n6The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a \u201cgood faith\u201d effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts: \n \nIn order to qualify for application of [the \u201cgood faith\u201d mitigating condition], an applicant \nmust present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \nsome other good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant\u2019s debts. The Directive does \nnot define the term \u2018good-faith.\u2019 However, the Board has indicated that the concept of \ngood-faith \u2018requires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, \nprudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.\u2019 Accordingly, an applicant must \ndo more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally available option (such as \nbankruptcy) in order to claim the benefit of [the \u201cgood faith\u201d mitigating condition].  \n \n\n \n8 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                                                                                                                            \nresponsibility for three SOR debts, and promising to pay them. AG \u00b6 20(e) is not \napplicable because Applicant did not provide documentation showing he disputed any \nof his SOR debts.   \n \nIn sum, Applicant should have been more diligent and made greater efforts \nsooner to resolve his delinquent SOR debts. He has had steady employment. He did \nnot provide proof of any payments to his SOR creditors. He has not provided \ndocumentation showing sufficient progress on his SOR debts. His steps are simply \ninadequate to fully mitigate financial considerations security concerns.  \n \nWhole Person Concept \n Under the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \nThe ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance \nmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nguidelines and the whole person concept. AG \u00b6 2(c). I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guideline F in my whole person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(a) were \naddressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional comment. \n \n Although the rationale for reinstating Applicant\u2019s clearance is insufficient to \nsupport a security clearance at this time, there are several factors tending to support \napproval of his clearance. Applicant is 43 years old. He is sufficiently mature to \nunderstand and comply with his security responsibilities. He has served in the Army \nsince 1987, and has a bachelor of science degree. He deserves substantial credit for \nvolunteering to support the Department of Defense as an employee of a defense \ncontractor. There is no evidence that he has ever violated security rules. There is every \nindication that he is loyal to the United States, the Department of Defense, and his \nemployer. There is no evidence that he abuses alcohol or uses illegal drugs. His fianc\u00e9e \nand then spouse\u2019s failure to pay their bills, and his divorce contributed to his financial \nwoes. He communicated with several creditors and discussed payment arrangements. \nThese factors show some responsibility, rehabilitation, and mitigation. \n \n(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2004) (quoting \nISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 4, 2001)). \n\n \n9 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \nThe whole person factors against reinstatement of Applicant\u2019s clearance are \nmore substantial at this time. Failure to pay or resolve his just debts is not prudent or \nresponsible. Applicant has a history of financial problems. His oldest delinquent SOR \ndebt became delinquent in 1998. When an OPM investigator interviewed him on \nNovember 13, 2008, he learned of several delinquent SOR debts. Financial security \nconcerns were further highlighted when he responded to DOHA interrogatories, and on \nSeptember 10, 2009, when he responded to the SOR. He had ample notice of his \ndelinquent SOR debts, and sufficient opportunity to make greater progress in the \nresolution of his SOR debts. He did not pay, start payments, document and justify any \ndisputes, or otherwise resolve any SOR debts. He did not prove he lacked sufficient \nincome to make greater progress resolving his debts. Applicant has not proven that he \nhas an established payment plan on any SOR debts. His promises to pay some of the \nSOR debts are insufficient to mitigate these debts because there is insufficient evidence \nto explain why he has not done more to address his SOR debts after becoming aware \nthat they raised a security concern.    \n \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, and all the facts and \ncircumstances, in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has not \nmitigated the financial considerations security concerns. I take this position based on \nthe law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988), my careful \nconsideration of the whole person and Adjudicative Process factors and supporting \nevidence, and my interpretation of my responsibilities under the Guidelines. Applicant \nhas failed to mitigate or overcome the government\u2019s case. For the reasons stated, I \nconclude he is not eligible for access to classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:   \n \n AGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a to 1.f:  \n Against Applicant \n \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for \na security clearance. Eligibility for a security clearance is denied. \n \n \n \n____________________________ \nMARK HARVEY \nAdministrative Judge \n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is a 35-year-old administrator working for a defense contractor. She was first employed by that company in 2007 as a temporary employee, but was made a permanent employee in April 2008. Applicant has completed some college. She is a single mother and presently engaged to be married. In high school, at age 15, Applicant started using marijuana. Her use was recreational and social. At age 21, she began dating a man who was \u201cheavily involved in drug addiction.\u201d By the time their relationship began to end, in 1998 or 1999, 2 Applicant was in her early 20s. She had begun using other drugs in lieu of marijuana.3 Specifically, she started using phencyclidine (PCP) and crack cocaine (crack). She also began relying on alcohol. In February 1999, she was driving with a male friend when a snow storm forced them to stay at a hotel. There, they used a liquid form of PCP. She blacked out and awoke disoriented. The hotel room was in disarray and the door was open. Having arrested her friend down the block, the police arrived to find her. The police took her to their car and seized the drugs and paraphernalia her friend had left in the room. She was taken to the hospital, arrested, and charged with possession of a controlled deadly substance and possession of drug paraphernalia. The case did not go before a court for adjudication. In lieu of prosecution, she was directly placed on conditional discharge with one year of probation, which she successfully completed. 4 ",

The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified\nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended, Department of Defense\nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program\n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised Adjudicative Guidelines\n(AG).\nIn an October 28, 2009, response, Applicant admitted all allegations set forth in\nthe SOR under Guideline G and Guideline H, and three of the four allegations raised\nunder Guideline E. She declined a hearing, but the government requested a hearing on\nNovember 4, 2009.  DOHA assigned the case to me on December 16, 2009. The\n1\nparties proposed a hearing date of February 10, 2002.

The hearing ultimately was postponed until\nMarch 3, 2010, due to inclement weather. An amended notice was issued on February\n18, 2010, reflecting that change. I convened the hearing as rescheduled. Applicant\ngave testimony and presented four documents, accepted into evidence without\nobjection as exhibits (Exs.) A-D. Department Counsel offered eight documents,\nadmitted as exhibits (Exs.) 1-8 without objection. The transcript (Tr.) of the proceeding\nwas received on March 11, 2010, and the record was closed on March 15, 2010. Based\non a review of the testimony, submissions, and exhibits, I find Applicant failed to meet\nher burden of mitigating security concerns related to all of the guidelines raised.\nClearance denied.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 35-year-old administrator working for a defense contractor. She\nwas first employed by that company in 2007 as a temporary employee, but was made a\npermanent employee in April 2008. Applicant has completed some college. She is a\nsingle mother and presently engaged to be married.\nIn high school, at age 15, Applicant started using marijuana. Her use was\nrecreational and social. At age 21, she began dating a man who was \u201cheavily involved\nin drug addiction.\u201d  By the time their relationship began to end, in 1998 or 1999,\n2\nApplicant was in her early 20s. She had begun using other drugs in lieu of marijuana.3\nSpecifically, she started using phencyclidine (PCP) and crack cocaine (crack). She also\nbegan relying on alcohol. In February 1999, she was driving with a male friend when a\nsnow storm forced them to stay at a hotel. There, they used a liquid form of PCP. She\nblacked out and awoke disoriented. The hotel room was in disarray and the door was\nopen. Having arrested her friend down the block, the police arrived to find her. The\npolice took her to their car and seized the drugs and paraphernalia her friend had left in\nthe room. She was taken to the hospital, arrested, and charged with possession of a\ncontrolled deadly substance and possession of drug paraphernalia. The case did not go\nbefore a court for adjudication. In lieu of prosecution, she was directly placed on\nconditional discharge with one year of probation, which she successfully completed. 4\nAlthough Applicant quit using drugs and alcohol when she discovered she was\npregnant in 2001, she resumed her substance abuse pattern after her daughter was\nborn.  Despite her efforts to regain control of her life and be a good mother, Applicant\n5\neventually returned to alcohol and drugs about a year later. She eventually sought help\n\n The name of one of the two institutions cited denotes that it is a \u201ctreatment center.\u201d See SOR. \n      6\n Ex. 6 (Treatment Center Medical Record, dated Jun. 17, 2009).

After\n7\ncompleting the program, it was recommended that she obtain continuing care and\nattend Narcotics Anonymous (NA) and Alcoholics Anonymous (AA). She followed the\nrecommendations for a few months, but then was injured in a car accident.  The\n8\nincident led to a relapse regarding alcohol. She prepared to begin an intensive alcohol\nprogram and to return to the treatment center in December 2006 for out-patient\nservices. The night before starting these programs, she abused illegal drugs.  While the\n9\nprograms helped her abstain from alcohol and drugs for \u201ca long period,\u201d she eventually\nrelapsed again in 2008.10\nApplicant\u2019s 2008 relapses occurred on weekends in February 2008 and in\nAugust 2008 due to \u201cstupidity.\u201d  She last used illegal drugs and alcohol between late\n11\nNovember and December 6 or 7 of 2008.  Her most recent relapses were caused by a\n12\nnumber of personal, domestic and professional stressors, many of which she has since\nresolved.  Neither her drug nor alcohol use ever impacted her work. She never used\n13\ndrugs or alcohol before or during the workday. She reported her 2008 relapses to her\nsuperiors at work on the Monday mornings following her weekend relapses.  She has\n14\nnot repeated treatment since December 2008.  Instead, she now relies extensively on\n15\nboth NA and AA, which she attends at least three days a week. She prefers AA, finding\nits approach to sustained sobriety more effective, and feeling it provides sufficient\noverlap with drug abuse to serve her present needs.  She speaks with her AA sponsor\n16\nand a network of female supporters daily. She also has the support of her parents and\na devoted fianc\u00e9, who does not abuse drugs. All of these individuals have been\ninvaluable resources given her current child custody litigation and pursuit of substance-\nfree living.  She has not had the urge for liquor despite her current problems, an urge\n17\n\n Id.\n      18\n Tr. 30-31, 55.\n      19\n See Response to the SOR, dated Oct. 28, 2009, at 3 (SOR allegation \u00b6 3.b).\n      20\n See Response to the SOR, dated Oct. 28, 2009, at 3 (SOR allegation \u00b6 3.c); Tr. 52.\n      21\n Tr.

She feels\n18\nshe now has the control and support she needs to maintain sobriety.\nIn completing her August 2008 SCA, Applicant failed to disclose her 1999 arrest\nin response to Section 23 (Have you ever been charged with or convicted of any\noffense[s] related to drugs or alcohol.). At the time, she was told by a superior that the\nquestion implied a 10-year time-frame, she thought the incident occurred in 1998, and\nalso understood that her completion of the probation effectively removed the arrest from\nher record.  She admitted intentionally concealing her PCP and crack cocaine use in\n19\nSection 24, where she only noted marijuana use from June 1990 until July 1992.  She\n20\nalso admitted failing to disclose the secondary intensive outpatient program for alcohol\nshe briefly attended in 2006 during or after her 2006 treatment, which she does not\nconsider to have been a treatment or counseling facility.  During an October 2008\n21\ninterview with an investigator, she denied using illegal drugs in the May 2006 \u201ctime\nframe\u201d referenced by the investigator because her subsequent drug relapses occurred\nat the end of 2006 and in 2008, well outside the scope of the May 2006 \u201ctime frame\u201d at\nissue. Applicant was ultimately granted an interim security clearance after her August\n2008 SCA, but the date it was granted was never established.22\nNow in control of her life, Applicant works about 45 hours a week and attends\nAA, NA, or related meetings about 10-15 hours a week.  Otherwise, she spends her\n23\ntime with her young daughter, her family, and fianc\u00e9. At work, she is well-regarded by\nher peers and receives superior appraisals with regard to her work performance and\ncharacter.  She does not conceal her past abuse of alcohol and drugs, nor does she\n24\nconceal her struggle to stay substance-free.  She has never been diagnosed as\n25\nalcohol dependent.26\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, an\nadministrative judge must consider the revised AG. In addition to brief introductory\n\n See also ISCR Case No. 94-1075 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Aug. 10, 1995).\n      27\n ISCR Case No. 93-1390 at 7-8 (App. Bd. Jan. 27, 1995).\n      28\n Id.\n      29\n5\nexplanations for each guideline, the AG list potentially disqualifying conditions and\nmitigating conditions. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead,\nrecognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in\nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative\njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision.\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), this process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables\nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based\non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nThe government must present evidence to establish controverted facts alleged in\nthe SOR. An applicant is responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to\nrebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by\nDepartment Counsel. . . .\u201d  The burden of proof is something less than a\n27\npreponderance of evidence. The ultimate burden of persuasion is on the applicant.  \n28\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\ngovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration\nof the possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \u201cThe clearly consistent standard\nindicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of\ndenials.\u201d  Any reasonable doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access\n29\n\n Id.\n      30\n Revised Adjudicative Guideline (AG) \u00b6 21.\n      31\n See AG \u00b6\u00b6 23a-d.\n      32\n6\nto sensitive information must be resolved in favor of protecting such sensitive\ninformation.30\nBased upon consideration of the evidence, Guideline H (Drug Involvement),\nGuideline G (Alcohol Consumption) and Guideline E (Personal Conduct) are the most\npertinent to this case. Conditions pertaining to these AGs that could raise a security\nconcern and may be disqualifying, as well as those which would mitigate such\nconcerns, are set forth and discussed below.\nAnalysis\nGuideline G \u2013 Alcohol Consumption\nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable\njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about an\nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness.  In this case, Applicant admits that she\n31\nabused alcohol, a substance which can trigger her illegal use of drugs. In 2006, it led\nher to seek professional assistance regarding alcohol. Alcohol Consumption\nDisqualifying Condition (AC DC) AG \u00b6 22 (a) (alcohol-related incidents away from work,\nsuch as driving while under the influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the\npeace, or other incidents of concern, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed\nas an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent) and  AC DC AG\u00b6 22 (c) (habitual or binge\nconsumption of alcohol to the point of impaired judgment, regardless of whether the\nindividual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent) apply. \nApplicant acknowledges the risks associated with her use of alcohol, especially\nwith regard to its potential to trigger her abuse of illegal drugs. She also acknowledges\nthat she has sought and received counseling regarding her alcohol use. While she is\nnow diligent in attending AA, has amassed a highly supportive network of friends and\nassociates to help her maintain sobriety, and credibly testified that it is her intent to\nremain alcohol-free, Applicant is aware of the difficult and daily challenge ahead of her\nin maintaining the sobriety she recently recommenced in December 2008. Given these\nfacts, none of the available Alcohol Consumption Mitigating Conditions (AC MC) apply\nand related security concerns remain unmitigated.32\nGuideline H \u2013 Drug Involvement\nUse of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise questions about\nan individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because it may impair judgment and\nbecause it raises questions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws,\n\n AG  \u00b6 24.\n      33\n Id. at \u00b6 24(a)(1-2).\n      34\n Id. at  \u00b6 24(b).\n      35\n As noted above, the medical record (Ex. 6) does not reflect the name or staff position of the individual\n      36\nwho made the diagnosis of PCP and crack cocaine dependence.\n7\nrules, and regulations.  \u201cDrugs\u201d are defined as mood and behavior altering substances,\n33\nand include drugs, materials, and other chemical compounds identified and listed in the\nControlled Substances Act of 1970, as amended, (e.g., marijuana or cannabis,\ndepressants, narcotics, stimulants, and hallucinogens) and inhalants and other\nsubstances.  \u201cDrug abuse\u201d is the illegal use of a drug or use of a legal drug in a\n34\nmanner that deviates from approved medical direction.  \n35\nApplicant admitted she used marijuana from about the age of 15 until she was in\nher early 20s. While her admitted abuse of that illegal substance was distant in time,\nshe also admitted to being arrested for possession of illegal drugs and drug\nparaphernalia, to receiving a diagnosis of PCP and crack cocaine dependency, and to\nusing PCP and crack cocaine intermittently until December 2008. Such facts give rise to\nDrug Involvement Disqualifying Condition AG \u00b6 25 (a) (any drug abuse), AG \u00b6 25 (c)\n(illegal drug possession, including cultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase, ale,\nor distribution; or possession of drug paraphernalia), and either AG \u00b6 (d) (diagnosis by\na duly qualified medical professional (e.g., physician, clinical psychologist, or ii) of a\ndrug abuse or drug dependence) or AG \u00b6 25 (e) (evaluation of drug abuse or drug\ndependence by a licensed clinical social worker who is a staff member or a recognized\ndrug treatment program).36\nApplicant admits that she is a long-term drug abuser who unsuccessfully sought\ntreatment for her drug dependence on more than one occasion. She also admits that\nshe last quit using illegal drugs in December 2008. Neither Drug Involvement Mitigating\nCondition AG \u00b6 26 (a) (the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or\nhappened under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt\non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment) nor AG \u00b6 26 (d)\n(satisfactory completion of a prescribed drug treatment program, including but not\nlimited to rehabilitation and aftercare requirements, without recurrence of abuse, and a\nfavorable prognosis by a duly qualified medical professional) applies. While she may\nhave changed her choice of friends and social venues in her attempt to remain drug-\nfree, thus potentially raising AG \u00b6 26( b)(1) (disassociation from drug-using associates\nand contacts) and (2) (changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used),\nthere is insufficient evidence to raise AG \u00b6 26 (b)(3) (an appropriate period of\nabstinence) or (4) (a signed statement of intent with automatic revocation of clearance\nfor any violation). AG \u00b6 26 (c) (abuse of prescription drugs was after a severed or\nprolonged illness during which these drugs were prescribed, and abuse has since\nended) is not applicable. Consequently, drug involvement security concerns remain\nunmitigated.\n\n AG \u00b6 15.\n      37\n Id.\n      38\n8\nGuideline E \u2013 Personal Conduct\nSecurity concerns arise from matters of personal conduct because \u201cconduct\ninvolving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply\nwith rules and regulations can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability,\ntrustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information.\u201c  In addition, \u201cany failure to\n37\nprovide truthful and candid answers during the security clearance process or any other\nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process\u201d is of special interest.  \n38\nHere, personal conduct concerns arose because when Applicant completed her\nAugust 7, 2008, SCA, she only noted her marijuana use between 1990 and 1992 in\nSection 24 and failed to mention her drug relapse in 2006 in response to Section 25\n(SOR allegations \u00b6\u00b6 3.b-3.c, respectively). She admitted these omissions. In addition,\nshe failed to note her 1999 arrest in response to Section 23 and, when questioned by\ninvestigators in October 2008, she failed to acknowledge that she had used drugs in the\nMay 2006 \u201ctime frame\u201d (SOR allegations \u00b6\u00b6 3.a and 3.d, respectively). \nIf shown to be true, such facts are sufficient to raise Personal Conduct\nDisqualifying Condition AG \u00b6 16 (a) (deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of\nrelevant facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or\nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications,\naward benefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or\naward fiduciary responsibilities) and AG \u00b6 16(b) (deliberately providing false or\nmisleading information concerning relevant facts to an employer, investigator, security\nofficial, competent medical authority, or other official government representative).\nConsequently, the burden shifts to Applicant to mitigate the resultant security concerns.\nAs a preliminary matter, Applicant credibly explained that she thought her 1999\narrest occurred in 1998, outside what she was instructed by a superior was a 10-year\nwindow for the question in Section 23. She also plausibly explained why she did not\nmention drug use in the May 2006 \u201ctime frame.\u201d Given her credible testimony, and in\nlight of her truthful admission of the other allegations under this guideline, I find that she\ndid not intend to mislead with these answers, thus mitigating related security concerns. \nHaving admitted that she intentionally denied SOR allegations \u00b6\u00b6 3.b-3.c and did\nnot note her admission until after the issuance of the 2009 SOR, neither Personal\nConduct Mitigating Condition AG \u00b6 17 (a) (the individual made prompt, good-faith effort\nto correct the omission, concealment, or falsification before being confronted by with\nthe facts) nor AG \u00b6 17(c) (the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the\nbehavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is\nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness,\nor good judgment) applies. At most, Applicant\u2019s candor with her family, associates, and\nemployer regarding her past drug and alcohol problems raise  AG \u00b6 17 (e) (the\nindividual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability to exploitation,\n\n9\nmanipulation, or duress). None of the other mitigating conditions apply. Given\nApplicant\u2019s admission that she intentionally concealed information on her SCA,\npersonal conduct security concerns remain unmitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept\nUnder the whole-person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of an applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant a security clearance\nmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the\nguidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case, as well as the \u201cwhole-person\u201d\nfactors. Applicant is a credible, mature, and well-spoken woman whose depiction of her\nstruggle for sobriety and a drug-free life was both blunt and highly moving. She makes\nno excuses for that struggle and takes full responsibility for it. Her sincerity when\nexpressing her desire to lead a substance-free life is beyond question. As an employee,\nshe is successful and well-regarded. Applicant is fighting to maintain the love, respect,\nand trust of her family, fianc\u00e9, and friends. She is committed to making strides one day\nat a time. Her testimony was nothing less than compelling. \nAt the same time, Applicant is highly realistic. She understands the difficult road\nahead of her in terms of alcohol and drugs, just as she understands the high burden\nplaced on an applicant in this process. While she is optimistic about maintaining her\ncurrent lifestyle, she appreciates the fact that her current attempt at remaining alcohol-\nand drug-free only dates back to early December 2008, and represents the longest\nperiod of time she has maintained such a lifestyle since she was a teen. In light of her\nlong history of alcohol and drug abuse, 16\u00bd months is an insufficient period to establish\nand demonstrate a maintained history of abstinence. Consequently, alcohol\nconsumption and drug involvement security concerns remain unmitigated.\nAs for personal conduct security concerns, Applicant\u2019s omissions on SCA\nSection 23 and her response to an investigator in October 2008 were not technically\nfalse, nor is there evidence she intended to mislead the interviewer. While she did not\nconsider \u201cintensive outpatient program\u201d for alcohol use to be the same as \u201calcohol-\n\n10\nrelated treatment or counseling,\u201d she fully admitted that she intentionally omitted\ninformation in responses to Sections 24 and 25 of the SCA. Such falsity sustains\npersonal conduct security concerns. \nAt present, Applicant appears to have all the resources necessary to maintain an\nalcohol and drug-free life. Hopefully, with continued dedication and the personal resolve\nshe demonstrated at the hearing, that goal will be realized. Currently, however, security\nconcerns under all three guidelines raised remain unmitigated. Clearance denied.   \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline H:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline G:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 3, Guideline E:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 3.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 3.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 3.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 3.d:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national interest to grant Applicant a security clearance.\nClearance denied.\nARTHUR E.

Limon, Esquire\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nMASON, Paul J., Administrative Judge:\nEven though eight of Applicant\u2019s nine accounts became delinquent in a three month\nperiod in 2005, Applicant has done almost nothing to address the listed indebtedness. In\naddition, he has suspended his repayment plans until after he receives a decision on his\nsecurity clearance. Applicant\u2019s favorable character evidence in the military and at his\ncurrent position do not successfully mitigate his financial problems. Eligibility for access to\nclassified information is denied. \nStatement of the Case\nApplicant completed and certified his Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations\nProcessing (e-QIP)(GE 1) on May 30, 2008. On April 30, 2010, DOHA issued a Statement\nof Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under financial considerations (Guideline F).\nApril 29, 2011\n\n2\nThe action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information\nwithin Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6,\nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as\namended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) implemented by the Department\nof Defense on September 1, 2006. \nApplicant submitted his answer to the SOR on June 4, 2010. DOHA issued a Notice\nof Hearing on September 14, 2010, for a hearing on October 7, 2010. The hearing was held\nas scheduled. At the hearing, four exhibits (GE 1 through 4) were admitted in evidence\n(without objection) in support of the Government\u2019s case. Applicant testified. His 14 exhibits\n(AE A through AE N) were admitted without objection. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.)\non October 15, 2010. The record closed on October 15, 2010. \nFindings of Fact\nThe SOR alleges security concerns raised under the financial considerations\nguideline. The nine financial allegations, which total approximately $87,728, identify eight\ncredit card account and one medical account. In his Answer, Applicant denied SOR 1.a and\n1.b, however, with no documentation from the creditor or one of the credit agencies\nshowing that the accounts do not belong to him, the two accounts remain his responsibility.\nExcept for SOR 1.f (medical account), he denied the remaining allegations as being\nfactually incorrect. Applicant denied SOR 1.h urging that the account belongs to his wife.\n(Tr. 52) Without additional documentation supporting his claim regarding this account and\nthe remaining accounts in the SOR, SOR 1.a, 1.b, 1.c, 1.d, 1.e, 1.g, 1.h., and 1.i, remain\nhis responsibility. His claim of satisfying SOR 1.f (medical account) is corroborated by\ndocumentation (AE I; Tr. 50). SOR 1.f is resolved in Applicant\u2019s favor. \nApplicant is 42 years old. He married his wife in August 1998. He has four children\nwhose ages range from four to ten. Applicant has been working as an avionics technician\nat the same job location since October 2006. A new defense contractor assumed the\ncontract in February 2009. (Tr. 27)\nMilitary and Employment History\nApplicant joined the U.S. Air Force in June 1986 after graduating from high school.\nHe trained in missile maintenance and graduated in June 1987, at the top of his class. He\nwas granted a security clearance in August 1987. Applicant participated in additional\ntraining to become a master missile technician in 1989. While there, he received a\nleadership award in 1990. He also earned 47 hours toward his degree in electronics. He\nreceived an honorable discharge in December 1990. After a few months he entered the Air\nNational Guard to become an avionics technician. (AE F)\n\n AE C reflects moving expenses of $3,600 for 2010, but no expenses for 2009. \n1\n3\nApplicant received additional avionics training from June 1992 until February 1993,\nand again graduated at the top of his class. After a few months, he found an Air Guard\nposition and also began working at a security company where he was promoted. Applicant\nwas selected for additional avionics training which he completed in 1999. He also received\ntwo awards for exemplary scholarship during training. (Id.)\nIn August 1999, Applicant\u2019s unit was ordered to take mandatory anthrax vaccination.\nApplicant suffered a severe reaction to the vaccine, and unsuccessfully sought an\nexemption from additional inoculations by the Air National Guard base commander. In\nFebruary 2000, the commander allowed Applicant to resign with an honorable discharge.\nIn February 2000, Applicant began working at a telecommunications company. In\nFebruary 2005, he found a job in his field and moved to another location where he worked\nas an electrician until September 2005, when he was laid off. In the next three months he\nwas unemployed, and the listed accounts became delinquent because he did not have the\nfunds to pay them. (Tr. 75) In November 2005, he resumed employment as an electronics\ntechnician.  \nIn September 2006, Applicant\u2019s employer sold his business, and Applicant was\nunemployed until late October 2006, when he was hired at his present location. In July\n2008, Applicant was reassigned by his employer to the current satellite location, where he\nearns extra money. (AE F)\nApplicant\u2019s Actions to Resolve SOR Accounts\nApplicant indicated that when he resumed employment in 2005, he contacted a\nfinancial counseling firm, but stopped his relationship with them after six months. No\nadditional information was provided. Then, he contacted a debt consolidation firm who,\ninstead of consolidating his debt, stole his money. (Tr. 90) They were sued by a several\nindividuals for not delivering unidentified debt consolidation services. (Tr. 77) \nIn August and October 2008, Applicant was interviewed by investigators from the\nOffice of Personnel Management (OPM) about his delinquent debt. (Tr. 85) Applicant\nattended 13 weeks of financial counseling in 2008 where he learned how to make a budget,\nsave money, and pay off debts. (AE B; Tr. 77-79) The financial counseling taught him to\npay off one delinquent debt at a time. By the end of 2009, using the saving methodology\nfor paying delinquent debts provided by the financial counseling, Applicant saved\napproximately $5,000 to pay off a debt. He had to use $3,000 to move his family to his\nemployer\u2019s headquarters.  \n1\n\n4\nApplicant currently has $9,700 to pay one of the listed creditors. (AE H) He has not tried\nto settle the listed account because he is afraid he could lose his security clearance. He\nstated:\nI would have [settled the account], except for the fact that I was afraid that if\nI do lose my clearance, that I will immediately lose my job, and I will have no\nmoney for my family to live on. So, I was waiting to find out the decision, and\nonce I get a decision then I will be able to continue with my original plan. (Tr.\n81)\nAccording to one of the financial counseling principles Applicant learned in 2008,\nproviding food and shelter for the family is the first priority. (Tr. 81). Paying the credit card\ndebt is last on the list to be addressed, although a budget should leave a remainder to\napply to debt. (Id.)\nAs the credit bureau reports show, except for SOR 1.f, the listed debts became\ndelinquent in September 2005. In an effort to raise money to pay off the listed debts and\nother unlisted debts, Applicant sold his home in June 2005, but recognized no gain on the\nsale. (Tr. 63) Applicant liquidated other possessions, but could not keep the listed accounts\ncurrent. (Tr. 40, 75) He indicated, \u201cthe combination of losing my wife[\u201d]s income, the\nmedical bills from her pregnancies, home repairs, and the lack of training on how to live on\na budget, caused me to get behind the curve financially.\u201d (GE 2 at 69)\nIn attachments to his interrogatory answers dated December 22, 2009, Applicant\nprovided copies of letters he sent to the SOR creditors and credit agencies between\nOctober and December 2009. In those letters, Applicant requested: (1) proof of the debt,\n(2) an audit be conducted on the delinquent debt, and (3) tax documents related to the\naccount be produced. In other letters to the credit agencies, he requested that the listed\ndebts be researched to remove any errant entries, and that the applicable statute of\nlimitations was in effect to make the debts uncollectible, and justifying removal of the debt\nfrom his credit report. Applicant claimed that based on the advice of a debt firm and a\nlawyer, he sent the letters to the creditors requesting information \u201cto show that I at least had\nattempted to keep up with the debt and not just let it slide.\u201d (Tr. 69) Applicant raised the\nstatute of limitations so that he could seek a settlement with one creditor and not worry\nabout being sued by the other listed creditors. (Tr. 82-83)\nCharacter Evidence\nSix character statements were furnished in Applicant\u2019s behalf. A coworker since\n1993 described Applicant as a self-starter who needed little supervision. (AE A) Witness\nE hired Applicant in October 2006. He believes Applicant is a skilled employee who has the\n\n5\nexpertise to solve problems in an efficient and professional manner. Witness K, who has\nbeen Applicant\u2019s coworker since the Fall of 2006, considers Applicant a diligent worker.\nWitness L has known Applicant since July 2008. In view of Applicant\u2019s outstanding job\nperformance, Witness L does not see why his financial issues should hinder his chances\nof receiving a security clearance. Witness M has known Applicant since July 2008, and\nbelieves he will do what is necessary to ensure the job is performed correctly. Applicant\nreceived a letter of commendation for eliminating an unsafe situation at his work station.\n(AE N; Tr. 26)\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant's suitability for a security clearance, the administrative\njudge must consider the AG. Each guideline lists potentially disqualifying conditions and\nmitigating conditions, which are required to be used to the extent they apply in evaluating\nan applicant's eligibility for access to classified information.\nThe administrative judge's ultimate goal is to reach a fair and impartial decision that\nis based on common sense. The decision should also include a careful, thorough\nevaluation of a number of variables known as the whole-person concept that brings\ntogether all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable\nand unfavorable, in making a decision. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified\ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation\nabout the potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14., the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.l5., the applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \"witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or\nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel . . . .\" The applicant\nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion for obtaining a favorable security decision.\nAnalysis\nFinancial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set forth in AG \u00b6 18:\nFailure or inability to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial\nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness\n\n6\nto abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an\nindividual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified\ninformation. An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having\nto engage in illegal acts to generate funds.\nThere are two disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 19 that may apply:\nAG \u00b6 19(a) (inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts); and \nAG \u00b6 19(c) (a history of not meeting financial obligations). \nIn approximately September 2005, Applicant was unable to maintain a current\npayment status on eight of nine debts, and they became delinquent. An SOR listing the\nnine accounts totaling $87,728, was mailed to Applicant on April 30, 2010. The total\nindebtedness is reduced by $53 with the documented satisfaction of SOR 1.f in May 2008.\nAt the present time, Applicant still owes $87,675 to eight creditors. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c)\napply.\nFive conditions under AG \u00b6 20 could potentially mitigate Applicant\u2019s delinquent\nindebtedness: \nAG \u00b6 20(a) (the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or\noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not\ncast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment); \nAG \u00b6 20(b) (the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely\nbeyond the person\u2019s control, and the person acted responsibly under the\ncircumstances); \nAG \u00b6 20(c) (the persona has received counseling for the problem and/or\nthere are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under\ncontrol);\nAG \u00b6 20(d) (the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue\ncreditors or otherwise resolve debts); and\nAG \u00b6 20(e) (the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy\nof the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides\ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides\nevidence to resolve the issue).\n\n7\nAG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply. Though the financial problems occurred more than five\nyears ago, the number of delinquent credit card accounts occurred under circumstances\nthat could recur. Resolving only one small debt in five years continues to raise uncertainty\nabout whether Applicant is truly committed to resolving the remaining debts. This doubt is\naggravated by Applicant\u2019s conditional position of addressing the debts after he receives a\ndecision regarding his security clearance. \nAG \u00b6 20(b) is partially applicable. Applicant\u2019s financial stability was strained by his\nunemployment for different periods in 2005 and 2006. However, he has been working full\ntime at his present job since October 2006, and has not acted responsibly in that time to\naddress the listed accounts. In addition, Applicant has provided inconsistent positions about\nhis intentions of repaying the debts. The documentation he sent out to the creditors and\ncollection agencies between October and December 2009 provides a strong suggestion\nhe was doing more than simply letting the creditors know he was monitoring the debt while\nseeking information about the accuracy of the delinquent accounts. \nBecause there are no clear indications that Applicant\u2019s financial problems are under\ncontrol, AG \u00b6 20(c) has minimal applicability to Applicant\u2019s case in mitigation. He testified\npersuasively about the positive impact that the 13-week financial counseling had on his\nfinancial practices. He created a budget and started a savings account. But while he claims\nthe financial counseling enabled him to structure a plan to repay the delinquent debts, the\nonly debt resolved is SOR 1.f, which was satisfied in May 2008. On balance, Applicant\u2019s\nsuccessful completion of the financial counseling entitles him to minimal mitigation under\nAG \u00b6 20(c).\nExcept for SOR 1.f, the record fails to show a good-faith effort by Applicant to repay\nthe listed delinquent accounts. Applicant\u2019s saving of money in a savings account and his\nconditional willingness to repay his delinquent debt does not qualify as a good-faith effort\nto repay overdue creditors. AG \u00b6 20(d) does not apply.\nApplicant filed several letters to the listed creditors and credit agencies. There is no\nevidence from any of the credit agencies that the disputed debts were removed from\nApplicant\u2019s credit report because the accounts were not his responsibility. The fact that\nmost of the listed creditors do not appear on his updated credit report September 29, 2010,\ndoes not mean he no longer owes the underlying debt. AG 20(e) does not apply.\nApplicant\u2019s favorable job performance evidence, and his evidence in mitigation under AG\n\u00b6\u00b6 20(b) and 20(c) does not overcome the adverse evidence under AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c).\nWhole-Person Concept \nIn evaluating Applicant\u2019s security clearance worthiness, I have examined the\nevidence under the disqualifying and mitigating conditions of the financial guideline. I have\n\n8\nalso weighed the circumstances within the context of nine variables known as the whole-\nperson concept. In evaluating the relevance of an individual's conduct, the administrative\njudge should consider the following factors:\nAG \u00b6 2(a) (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich the participation was voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for\nthe conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress;\nand, (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nThe record reflects that Applicant joined the Air Force in 1986 right after high school.\nIn June 1987, he graduated at the top in his class in missile maintenance. He attended\nadditional training to become a master missile technician in 1989, and received a coveted\nleadership award while earning 47 hours in electronics. After a few months away from the\nservice, he joined the Air National Guard to become an avionics technician. He completed\nadditional avionics training in 1992, and received awards for his training performance in\n1999. In February 2000, Applicant received an honorable discharge from the Air National\nGuard. Between 2000 and February 2005, he worked for a telecommunications company\nbefore returning to his field of avionics. However, until October 2006, the jobs were short-\nlived and there were periods of unemployment. \nThe listed accounts in the SOR were caused by up to three months of\nunemployment in September 2005. He maintains he simply ran out of money and could not\nrepay the debt. \nApplicant has been employed consistently since October 2006. He was placed on\nnotice in August and October 2008 that his debts were a security concern to the\nGovernment. The second notification by the Government came in December 2009 when\nApplicant was asked what specific action he had taken with respect to the individual\naccounts listed in the SOR. The documentation Applicant provided in response to the\ninterrogatories does not show an effort to repay the debts. Rather, it suggests Applicant\nwas demanding the debts be removed because of the relevant statute of limitations. \nAt the hearing, Applicant\u2019s position is that he is not going to pay the debts until he\ngets decision on his security clearance. Applicant\u2019s understanding of the security clearance\nhearing process demonstrates poor judgment. Under the Directive, the purpose of the\nhearing is to determine whether an applicant has the qualifications to possess a security\nclearance. Demonstrating qualifications under the financial guideline includes corroborating\nevidence demonstrating that an applicant has taken credible steps to restore control over\n\n9\nhis financial delinquencies. Applicant knew about the delinquent debt in 2005 when he\nengaged a debt firm to address the indebtedness. He was advised by the Government in\nAugust and October 2008, and December 2009, that his delinquent debts were a security\nconcern to the Government. Applicant\u2019s limited efforts to satisfy the delinquent accounts\nand favorable character evidence are not sufficient to mitigate the negative evidence under\nthe financial guideline.\nFormal Findings\nParagraph 1 (Guideline F):\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.i:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant Applicant access to classified information.\nEligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nPaul J.

Hoffman, Esq., Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro se   \n                     \n           \n______________\nDecision\n______________\nLEONARD, Michael H., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant contests the Defense Department\u2019s intent to deny or revoke his\neligibility for a security clearance to work in the defense industry. The evidence shows\nhe has a history of financial problems or difficulties. Although he did not present a\nperfect case, and has not paid off each and every debt at issue, he presented sufficient\nevidence to establish a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve\ndebts, thereby mitigating the security concerns stemming from his problematic financial\nhistory. He did not provide deliberately false answers in response to two questions on\nhis security clearance application. Accordingly, as explained below, this case is decided\nfor Applicant.\nJuly 18, 2011\n\n  This case is adjudicated under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry,\n1\nsigned by President Eisenhower on February 20, 1960, as amended, as well as DoD Directive 5220.6,\nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program, dated January 2, 1992, as amended\n(Directive). In addition, the Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified\nInformation (AG), effective within the Defense Department on September 1, 2006, apply to this case.  The AG\nwere published in the Federal Register and codified in 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 154, Appendix H (2006). The AG replace\nthe guidelines contained in Enclosure 2 to the Directive.   \n2\nStatement of the Case\nActing under the relevant Executive Order and DoD Directive,  on October 1,\n1\n2010, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (the Agency) issued a statement of\nreasons (SOR) explaining that it was not clearly consistent with the national interest to\ngrant Applicant access to classified information. The SOR is similar to a complaint, and\nit detailed the factual basis for the action under the security guideline known as\nGuideline F for financial considerations. The SOR alleged 21 delinquent debts in\namounts ranging from $36 to $4,470 for a total of about $14,916. The 21 debts consist\nof collection accounts, charged-off accounts, and an unpaid judgment; 11 debts are for\nrelatively small amounts (less than $250).  \nApplicant answered the SOR and requested a hearing. The case was assigned\nto me February 9, 2011. The hearing took place March 28, 2011. The transcript (Tr.)\nwas received April 5, 2011. \nThe record was kept open for 30 days, until April 28, 2011, to provide Applicant\nan opportunity to submit additional documentary information in support of his case. He\nmade a timely submission, and those matters are admitted, without objections, as\nExhibits P\u2013U.  \nRulings on Procedure\nThe SOR was amended to correct a clerical error in SOR \u00b6 2.b by changing\n\u201csubparagraphs 1.a through 1.v, above\u201d to \u201csubparagraphs 1.a through 1.u, above.\u201d\nWithout objections, the motion to amend was granted.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 33-year-old employee of a federal contractor.

He had a full-time\njob while in college, working as a testing technician. He was awarded a degree as an\naviation electrician in March 2008, and he began his current employment as an aircraft\nelectrician the same month. In addition, he is currently pursuing a bachelor\u2019s degree in\napplied science. His employer is providing tuition assistance and he also receives GI Bill\nbenefits. He is seeking an industrial security clearance for the first time. \n\n Exhibit 2.\n2\n Exhibit B. \n3\n Exhibits N and O. \n4\n Exhibit N. \n5\n Exhibit C. \n6\n Exhibit D. \n7\n3\nApplicant\u2019s employment history includes military service in the U.S. Marine Corps\nduring 1995\u20132002.

Recently, he had a short-term disability for about\n60 days in early 2011 due to a broken hand, and he received 75% of his covered\nearnings during this period.  \n3\nApplicant has a good employment record for his current job as verified by his\ncurrent supervisor and a recent annual evaluation.  His annual evaluation for March\n4\n2009\u2013March 2010 is highly favorable with an overall performance rating of \u201cfar exceeds\nexpectations.\u201d His supervisor also described him in highly favorable terms as follows:\n[Applicant] is one of the most reliable employees I have working for me.\nHis work performance and knowledge is outstanding, but the most\nimportant item of [his] character is reliability. I have over 100 employees\nworking for me and I can say that I count on [Applicant] more than any of\nthe others. If I have a highly important (time/cost critical) task, I always\nassign it to [Applicant] because I know the job will be completed ahead of\nthe deadline and the quality of work will be outstanding. I actually have 2\ntasks on every aircraft that I will only allow him to accomplish. [Applicant]\nwas awarded a Top Star award this year for his outstanding work\nperformance and dedication to [the company].5\nApplicant and his first wife separated while he was on active duty in the Marine\nCorps. Thereafter, a divorce was finalized in October 2002, in which Applicant was\nrequired to pay child support for his daughter born during the marriage.  As additional\n6\nchild support, he was ordered to provide medical support for the child. He began to fall\nbehind on these obligations in late 2004 after leaving his job as a detention officer at a\nsheriff\u2019s office. In time, this led an enforcement action in October 2008, when Applicant\nwas found in contempt for failure to pay child support and medical bills as previously\nordered.  The court determined that: (1) he was in arrears for $1,302 for the period\n7\n\n Exhibit 1. \n8\n Tr. 31\u201332.\n9\n Tr. 106\u2013109.\n10\n Exhibit F. \n11\n4\nNovember 26, 2002, through August 1, 2008; (2) he was in arrears for $776.12 for\nunpaid medical bills; and (3) he was liable for $881.40 for attorney\u2019s fees and costs.\nThese unpaid medical bills are the same medical bills alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.k, 1.l, 1.m,\n1.p, and 1.u, which total $777. As a result, the court granted a cumulative judgment\nagainst him for $2,959.52. Applicant has since paid the judgment, and he is current with\nhis ongoing child support obligation. None of the child support matters are alleged in the\nSOR.    \nApplicant married his current wife in 2007, and they have two very young\nchildren. His wife is not employed outside the home, and in fact she receives monthly\ndisability compensation from the Social Security Administration. She was determined\ndisabled due to an assault by a former boyfriend. \nApplicant completed a security clearance application in November 2008.  In\n8\ndoing so, he did not disclose the unpaid $159 judgment alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.q in\nresponse to the relevant question about unpaid judgments. Also, he did not disclose any\nof the delinquent debts alleged in the SOR in response to the relevant question about\ndelinquent debts. But he did disclose the following adverse information: (1) the job\ntermination from the railroad in 2005; (2) a single incident of domestic violence in 2008;\nand (3) the child support enforcement action in 2008. He explained in his testimony that\nhe answered the financial questions in the negative because he did not know the details\nof his financial situation, and he answered in the negative rather than answer in the\naffirmative and be unable to disclose any details.  He also explained that he had no\n9\nintention to provide false answers and was not trying to hide anything.  I found his\n10\nexplanations credible and worthy of belief. \nConcerning the debts alleged in the SOR, Applicant demonstrated through his\ntestimony and documentary exhibits that 12 of the 21 debts are paid or settled; 2 debts\nare otherwise resolved; 2 debts are in the process of repayment; 4 debts are\nunresolved; and 1 debt is a duplicate. The four unresolved debts are generally the\nlargest individual debts and total about $9,901. In addition, he presented proof of\npayment in November 2009 for a collection account not alleged in the SOR.  The\n11\ncurrent status of the debts alleged in the SOR is described in the following table.\nDebt\nCurrent Status\nSOR \u00b6 1.a\u2013$124 collection account.\nPaid as of Feb. 2011.

He and his wife are not incurring new debt\nbased on credit.   \nLaw and Policies\nThis section sets forth the general principles of law and policies that apply to an\nindustrial security clearance case. The only purpose of a clearance decision is to decide\nif an applicant is suitable for access to classified information. The Department of\nDefense takes the handling and safeguarding of classified information seriously\nbecause it affects our national security, the lives of our servicemembers, and our\noperations abroad. \nIt is well-established law that no one has a right to a security clearance.  As\n13\nnoted by the Supreme Court in Department of Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe clearly consistent\nstandard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the\nside of denials.\u201d  Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive, any doubt\n14\nabout whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified information will be\nresolved in favor of protecting national security.  \nA favorable clearance decision establishes eligibility of an applicant to be granted\na security clearance for access to confidential, secret, or top-secret information.  An\n15\nunfavorable decision (1) denies any application, (2) revokes any existing security\nclearance, and (3) prevents access to classified information at any level.  \n16\n\n ISCR Case No. 02-18663 (App. Bd. Mar. 23, 2004).\n17\n Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.14.\n18\n Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n19\n Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n20\n Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n21\n ISCR Case No. 01-20700 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002) (citations omitted).\n22\n Executive Order 10865, \u00a7 7.\n23\n AG \u00b6\u00b6 18, 19, and 20 (setting forth the security concern and the disqualifying and mitigating conditions). \n24\n See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996) (It is well settled that \u201cthe security suitability of an\n25\napplicant is placed into question when that applicant is shown to have a history of excessive indebtedness\nor recurring financial difficulties.\u201d) (citation omitted). \n7\nThere is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for\naccess to classified information.  The Government has the burden of presenting\n17\nevidence to establish facts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted.  An\n18\napplicant is responsible for presenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate\nfacts that have been admitted or proven.  In addition, an applicant has the ultimate\n19\nburden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.  In Egan, the Supreme\n20\nCourt stated that the burden of proof is less than a preponderance of the evidence.21\nThe DOHA Appeal Board has followed the Court\u2019s reasoning, and a judge\u2019s findings of\nfact are reviewed under the substantial-evidence standard.22\nThe AG set forth the relevant standards to consider when evaluating a person\u2019s\nsecurity clearance eligibility, including disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions\nfor each guideline. In addition, each clearance decision must be a commonsense\ndecision based upon consideration of the relevant facts and circumstances, the\npertinent criteria and adjudication factors, and the whole-person concept. \nThe Government must be able to have a high degree of trust and confidence in\nthose persons to whom it grants access to classified information. The decision to deny a\nperson a security clearance is not a determination of an applicant\u2019s loyalty.  Instead, it\n23\nis a determination that an applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President has\nestablished for granting eligibility for access.\nAnalysis\nUnder Guideline F for financial considerations,  the suitability of an applicant\n24\nmay be questioned or put into doubt when that applicant has a history of excessive\nindebtedness or financial problems or difficulties.  The overall concern under Guideline\n25\nF is:\n\n AG \u00b6 18.  \n26\n AG \u00b6 19(a).  \n27\n AG \u00b6 19(c). \n28\n8\n \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to\nprotect classified information.  \n26\nSimilarly, an individual who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible,\nunconcerned, negligent, or careless in properly handling and safeguarding classified\ninformation within the defense industry.   \nThe evidence here supports a conclusion that Applicant has a history of financial\nproblems or difficulties. This raises security concerns because it indicates inability or\nunwillingness to satisfy debts  and a history of not meeting financial obligations  within\n27\n28\nthe meaning of Guideline F. The facts are sufficient to establish these two disqualifying\nconditions. \nThere are six mitigating conditions to consider under Guideline F. Any of the\nfollowing may mitigate security concerns:  \n\u00b6 20(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or\noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not\ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment;\n\u00b6 20(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely\nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business\ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or\nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;\n\u00b6 20(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is\nunder control;\n\u00b6 20(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors\nor otherwise resolve debts;\n\u00b6 20(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of\nthe past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides\ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides\nevidence of actions to resolve the issue; or \n\n AG \u00b6\u00b6 15\u201317 (setting forth the security concern and the disqualifying and mitigating conditions). \n29\n9\n\u00b6 20(f) the affluence resulted from a legal source of income.\nThe most pertinent here is \u00b6 20(d)\u2014making a good-faith effort\u2014and it is discussed\nbelow.\nApplicant\u2019s problematic financial history appears to be due to an unstable or\ninconsistent employment history since his discharge from the Marine Corps in 2002. It\nwas probably made more difficult by his legal and moral obligation to pay child support\nand associated medical bills for his daughter, because once he fell behind, it was\ndifficult to become current. It came to a head with the enforcement action in 2008, and\nhe is now current on all child support matters. Roughly concurrent with his resolving the\nchild support matter, he completed college and began a new career as an aircraft\nelectrician in 2008. Since then, his employment and finances have become more stable\nor consistent. He is doing quite well at work and is pursuing further education to improve\nhis prospects with his employer. \nApplicant has also been able to pay his current expenses and successfully\naddress many of his delinquent debts. As set forth in the table above, 12 of the 21 debts\nare paid or settled; 2 debts are otherwise resolved; 2 debts are in the process of\nrepayment; 4 debts are unresolved; and 1 debt is a duplicate. The four unresolved\ndebts are generally the largest individual debts and total about $9,901. In addition, he\npresented proof of payment in November 2009 for a collection account not alleged in\nthe SOR. And unlike many applicants in financial cases, he did a good job of providing\ndocumentary evidence to support or corroborate his representations about his efforts to\naddress the debts. His written monthly budget reflects a positive net remainder of more\nthan $1,000, and he is beginning to accumulate a small amount of financial assets. This\nmoney will allow him to address his outstanding delinquent debts. Although he did not\npresent a perfect case, and has not paid off each and every debt in the SOR, he has\nmade substantial progress. Given the totality of facts and circumstances, I conclude that\nApplicant has initiated a good-faith effort to repay his overdue creditors or otherwise\nresolve debts, thereby mitigating the security concerns stemming from his problematic\nfinancial history. \nUnder Guideline E for personal conduct,  the suitability of an applicant may be\n29\nquestioned or put into doubt due to false statements and credible adverse information\nthat may not be enough to support action under any other guideline. The overall\nconcern under Guideline E is:  \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations [that may] raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to\nprotect classified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide\n\n AG \u00b6 15. \n30\n AG \u00b6 2(a)(1)\u2013(9). \n31\n10\ntruthful and candid answers during the security clearance process or any\nother failure to cooperate with the security clearance process.  \n30\nA statement is false when it is made deliberately (knowingly and willfully). An omission\nof relevant and material information is not deliberate if the person genuinely forgot about\nit, inadvertently overlooked it, misunderstood the question, or genuinely thought the\ninformation did not need to be reported. \nThe issue here is whether Applicant made deliberately false statements when\nanswering two questions about his financial record on his 2008 security clearance\napplication. Based on the evidence, to include his hearing testimony, which I found\ncredible, I am not persuaded he made deliberately false statements. He answered the\nquestions in the negative because he did not know the details of his financial situation.\nAny intent to willfully falsify is rebutted by his willingness to disclose: (1) the job\ntermination from the railroad in 2005; (2) a single incident of domestic violence in 2008;\nand (3) the child support enforcement action in 2008. Given those disclosures, I am not\npersuaded that he was attempting to mislead or conceal adverse financial information in\norder to put his security clearance application in a more favorable light.    \nTo conclude, Applicant presented sufficient evidence to overcome the security\nconcerns, and I am persuaded that he will exercise the required good judgment,\nreliability, and trustworthiness. In reaching this conclusion, I gave due consideration to\nthe nine factors of the whole-person concept.  He received favorable consideration for\n31\nhis honorable military service, his current good employment record, and his improving\noverall financial situation. Accordingly, I conclude that Applicant met his ultimate burden\nof persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision. This case is decided for\nApplicant. \nFormal Findings\nThe formal findings on the SOR allegations are as follows:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraphs 1.a\u20131.u: \nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline E:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraphs 2.a\u20132.b:\nFor Applicant\n\n11\nConclusion\nIn light of the record as a whole, it is clearly consistent with the national interest\nto grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified\ninformation is granted.           \nMichael H. Leonard\nAdministrative Judge \n",

Michael Lyles, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On June 4, 2009, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the\nbasis for that decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of\n\n\u201cI would bring the money home and she would go pay all the bills.  And mainly some of the bills are from\n1\nphone companies, which is cell phones.  It was easy for her to just, okay, they cut this phone off.  Let me go get another\none.\u201d  Tr. at 28.  \nThe hearing began on September 15, 2009.  Tr. at 3.  \n2\n2\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant\nrequested a hearing.  On March 19, 2010, after the hearing, Administrative Judge Paul J. Mason\ngranted Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Department Counsel appealed pursuant to\nDirective \u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nDepartment Counsel raised the following issues on appeal: whether certain of the Judge\u2019s\nfindings of fact were based upon substantial record evidence; whether the Judge erred in his\napplication of the pertinent mitigating conditions; and whether the Judge\u2019s whole-person analysis\nwas erroneous.  Finding error, we reverse.\nFacts\nThe Judge made the following pertinent findings of fact: Applicant is a former U.S. Marine\nwho, while on active duty, served as a drill instructor and as a guard for nuclear weapons.  Divorced,\nhe pays child support on behalf of his two daughters.  He is engaged to be married.\nApplicant\u2019s financial problems began during his first marriage, during which his former wife\nhandled their finances.   The problems were exacerbated when Applicant\u2019s wife decided that she did\n1\nnot want to live in a mobile home.  In 2006, the couple moved out of the mobile home and into a\nrented house, surrendering the home to the dealer.  The dealer treated this transaction as a\nrepossession, selling the home at an auction.  This resulted in a $33,173 deficiency.\nApplicant stopped paying the other SOR debts due to lack of funds.  Additionally, he moved\nseveral times during the divorce and did not keep his creditors apprised of his address.  Although it\nwas not listed in the SOR, Applicant also had a debt to the IRS which had been satisfied through a\nwage garnishment.  \nOn September 9, 2009, Applicant applied for a $7,000 loan from his 401(k) plan.   He\n2\nintended to use the money to pay off six of the seven SOR debts.  After the hearing, but before the\nclose of the record, Applicant completed necessary paperwork for the loan.  He also provided an\nuncorroborated statement that four of the debts had been paid off.  \nApplicant enjoys an excellent reputation for the high quality of his work performance, as well\nas for his reliability.\nDiscussion\nFactual Sufficiency\n\n3\nDepartment Counsel argues that the Judge erred in a finding of fact.  Specifically, he argues\nthat a particular statement, contained in the Analysis portion of the decision, is in error.  The Judge\nstated, \u201cI conclude that Applicant received his loan as planned.\u201d  Decision at 6.  Department Counsel\nargues that the evidence merely demonstrates that Applicant had applied for a loan, not that he had\nactually received the money.  \nThe Appeal Board\u2019s review of the Judge\u2019s findings of fact is limited to determining if they\nare supported by substantial evidence\u2013\u201csuch relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept\nas adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the same record.\u201d\nDirective  \u00b6 E3.1.32.1.  \u201cThis is something less than the weight of the evidence, and the possibility\nof drawing two inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent an administrative\nagency\u2019s finding from being supported by substantial evidence.\u201d  Consolo v. Federal Maritime\nComm\u2019n, 383 U.S. 607, 620 (1966).  In evaluating the Judge\u2019s findings, we defer to the Judge\u2019s\ncredibility determinations.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1.\nWe have examined the challenged statement in light of the record evidence.  This evidence\nshows that Applicant applied for the loan a few days before the hearing in his case.  The insurance\ncompany processing the request advised Applicant that he needed to provide further information,\neither a signed concurrence by his wife or a certification that he was no longer married.  After the\nhearing, Applicant submitted a document he had sent to the insurance company certifying that he was\nno longer married to his former wife.  There is nothing in the evidence to suggest that the approval\nof the loan was uncertain or that Applicant\u2019s 401(k) was insufficient to serve as collateral.  Rather,\nthe evidence suggests that approval would be forthcoming once Applicant submitted all the required\ndocumentation.  Given the totality of the facts and circumstances surrounding the loan application,\nthe Judge\u2019s inference that Applicant had been paid at some point after the hearing is sustainable.  \nJudge\u2019s Favorable Conclusions as to Mitigation\nA Judge is required to \u201cexamine the relevant data and articulate a satisfactory explanation\nfor\u201d the decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.\u2019\u201d\nMotor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n of the United States v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43\n(1983)(quoting Burlington Truck Lines, Inc. v. United States, 371 U.S. 156, 168 (1962)).  \u201cThe\ngeneral standard is that a clearance may be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests\nof the national security.\u2019\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  The Appeal\nBoard may reverse the Judge\u2019s decision to grant, deny, or revoke a security clearance if it is arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.  Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.32.3 and E3.1.33.3.\nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility, there is a strong\npresumption against the grant or maintenance of a security clearance.  See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913\nF. 2d 1399, 1401 (9  Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991).  After the Government presents\nth\nevidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut or mitigate those\nconcerns.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  \u201cThe application of disqualifying and mitigating conditions and\nwhole person factors does not turn simply on a finding that one or more of them apply to the\nparticular facts of a case.  Rather, their application requires the exercise of sound discretion in light\n\n\u201c[T]he conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control . . . and the\n3\nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances[.]\u201d  \n4\nof the record evidence as a whole.\u201d  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 05-03635 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 20,\n2006).\nIn deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are arbitrary or capricious, the Board\nwill review the Judge's decision to determine whether:  it does not examine relevant evidence; it fails\nto articulate a satisfactory explanation for its conclusions, including a rational connection between\nthe facts found and the choice made; it does not consider relevant factors; it reflects a clear error of\njudgment; it fails to consider an important aspect of the case; it offers an explanation for the decision\nthat runs contrary to the record evidence; or it is so implausible that it cannot be ascribed to a mere\ndifference of opinion.  In deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are contrary to law,\nthe Board will consider whether they are contrary to provisions of Executive Order 10865, the\nDirective, or other applicable federal law.  See ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Jun. 2,\n2006).\nDepartment Counsel argues that the Judge erred in extending favorable application to three\nGuideline F mitigating conditions.  He contends that the record evidence does not support the\nJudge\u2019s treatment of them. \nThe first mitigating condition that the Judge addressed is found at Directive, Enclosure 2 \u00b6\n20(b).   The Judge extended partial application to this provision.  However, Department Counsel\n3\ncites to record evidence that Applicant\u2019s financial problems were aggravated by his decision to leave\nhis mobile home and move into a rented house due to his wife\u2019s preferences.  Arguing that this was\na voluntary decision by Applicant, Department Counsel contends that this decision by Applicant\ndoes not justify a conclusion that Applicant\u2019s problems arose from matters outside his control.  \u201c[H]e\nchose to take on a new financial responsibility (rent) and abandoned his existing obligation.  While\nbeing a loyal husband trying to hold together a failing marriage is an admirable personal quality, this\nis not a carte blanche invitation to make irresponsible financial decisions.\u201d  DC Brief at 11.  \nWe note other record evidence which supports the point advanced by Department Counsel.\nFor example, Applicant testified, and the Judge found, that he had neglected to keep his creditors\ninformed of his whereabouts.  It is not surprising that, as a consequence, he would have problems\nwith his creditors.  This is a contributing factor which Applicant could have avoided through the\nexercise of ordinary prudence.  We also note Applicant\u2019s testimony that, when he gave back his\nmobile home, he did not understand the legal implications of repossession.  Again, this illustrates\na failure to exercise ordinary care in the management of his personal affairs rather than a cause over\nwhich Applicant had no control.  Accordingly, we conclude that the record as a whole does not\nsupport a conclusion that Applicant\u2019s problems were caused by circumstances outside his control,\ni.e., his marital difficulties.  Rather, the evidence most reasonably supports a conclusion that\nApplicant\u2019s problems originated through his own actions or neglect.\n\n\u201c[T]he person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear indications that\n4\nthe problem is being resolved or is under control[.]\u201d  \n\u201c[T]he individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts[.]\u201d  \n5\n5\nAdditionally, Department Counsel contends that Applicant failed to demonstrate that he took\nresponsible action in regard to his financial difficulties.  For example, he notes Applicant\u2019s testimony\nthat he had taken no action to address his debts until September 2009, leaving them unpaid for three\nyears.  This extends even to relatively minor debts, such as an $81 medical bill.  Tr. at 40.  The Judge\nhimself stated that Applicant did not act responsibly under the circumstances.  Department Counsel\u2019s\nargument that Mitigating Condition 20(b) does not support a favorable decision for Applicant is\npersuasive.\nThe Judge also extended favorable consideration to Directive, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 20(c).   He cited\n4\nto \u201csome evidence\u201d that Applicant was trying to gain control over his finances.  Decision at 6.\nHowever, Department Counsel persuasively argues that the evidence is not sufficient to support a\nfavorable conclusion under this mitigating condition.  Applicant has demonstrated that he expected\nto pay off certain debts with the proceeds from his loan.  However, even if that were to occur, his\nmajor debt of the $33,000 deficiency resulting from repossession of his mobile home would remain\nunsatisfied.  Applicant\u2019s stated intention to hire an attorney sometime after the hearing and seek a\nreduction of this debt is at best speculative.  There is no basis in the record to support a conclusion\nthat such a plan has a reasonable chance of success.  As such, it merely suggests a \u201cpotential for\neventual debt resolution\u201d rather than for a track record of actual repayment.  See ISCR Case No. 01-\n03695 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 16, 2002).  The record evidence, viewed as a whole, does not support a\nfavorable conclusion under Mitigating Condition 20(c).  \nFinally, the Judge concluded that Applicant had established limited mitigation under\nDirective, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 20(d)  and that he was confident that Applicant would pay all of his\n5\ndelinquent debts.  This mitigating condition requires a showing of good-faith efforts at debt\nrepayment.  To receive the benefit of this mitigating condition, an applicant must show that he has\nacted in a way evidencing \u201creasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.\u201d\nISCR Case No. 06-14521 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 15, 2007).  Department Counsel persuasively argues\nthat Applicant\u2019s having apparently obtained a $7,000 loan is not sufficient to demonstrate a good-\nfaith effort to pay off debts totaling over $36,000.  Even if he repays all SOR debts but the\ndeficiency, he is left with a delinquent debt of over $33,000, for which he has demonstrated nothing\nmore than a promise for future payment.  See ISCR Case No. 07-13041 at 4 (App. Bd. Sep. 19, 2008)\n(Promises to pay off delinquent debts in the future are not a substitute for a track record of paying\ndebts in a timely manner and otherwise acting in a financially responsible manner.)  We conclude\nthat the circumstances of Applicant\u2019s financial problems do not demonstrate a good-faith effort to\nresolve his outstanding debts.  As Department Counsel argues, even a limited favorable application\nof this mitigating condition is not supported by the record evidence.\nIn summary, both the record and the Judge\u2019s decision demonstrate that (1) Applicant has\nsubstantial delinquent debts; (2) these debts were caused in large measure by circumstances that were\n\nSee ISCR Case No. 08-06056 at 6 (App. Bd. Sep 21, 2009), in which the Board held that it was error for the\n6\nJudge not to have considered \u201cthe fact that any efforts on the part of Applicant to resolve these debts came very late in\nthe process.\u201d  \n6\nwithin his control, such as his permitting his former wife to handle the family budget, the voluntary\nrepossession of his mobile home, his failure to keep his creditors apprised of his place of residence,\nand his failure to inquire into the legal implications of his decisions; (3) he did not address his debts\nfor three years and only began to do so immediately before the hearing;  and (4) he provided no\n6\ncorroboration of any debt repayment by the close of the record.  In light of this, Applicant\u2019s having\nobtained approval of a loan in the amount of $7,000 is not sufficient to demonstrate mitigation, either\nthrough the mitigating conditions or the whole-person analysis, in light of the Egan standard.\nAccordingly, we conclude that the Judge\u2019s favorable decision is not sustainable.\nOrder\nThe Judge\u2019s favorable security clearance decision is REVERSED.\nSigned: Jeffrey D.

Finding error, we reverse. Facts The Judge made the following pertinent findings of fact: Applicant is a former U.S. Marine who, while on active duty, served as a drill instructor and as a guard for nuclear weapons. Divorced, he pays child support on behalf of his two daughters. He is engaged to be married. Applicant\u2019s financial problems began during his first marriage, during which his former wife handled their finances. The problems were exacerbated when Applicant\u2019s wife decided that she did 1 not want to live in a mobile home. In 2006, the couple moved out of the mobile home and into a rented house, surrendering the home to the dealer. The dealer treated this transaction as a repossession, selling the home at an auction. This resulted in a $33,173 deficiency. Applicant stopped paying the other SOR debts due to lack of funds. Additionally, he moved several times during the divorce and did not keep his creditors apprised of his address. Although it was not listed in the SOR, Applicant also had a debt to the IRS which had been satisfied through a wage garnishment. On September 9, 2009, Applicant applied for a $7,000 loan from his 401(k) plan. He 2 intended to use the money to pay off six of the seven SOR debts. After the hearing, but before the close of the record, Applicant completed necessary paperwork for the loan. He also provided an uncorroborated statement that four of the debts had been paid off. Applicant enjoys an excellent reputation for the high quality of his work performance, as well as for his reliability.",

On April 20, 2009, Applicant provided interrogatory\nanswers to his debt delinquencies. On June 4, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings\nand Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns\nunder financial considerations (Guideline F). The action was taken pursuant to\nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February\n20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial\nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended\n(Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President\non December 29, 2005, and made effective within the Department of Defense for SORs\nissued on or after September 1, 2006.\nMarch 19, 2010\n\n AE F is not in the record because it was not admitted in evidence. AE F, a position statement of Applicant\u2019s\n1\ncareer in the United States Marine Corps (USMC) and with his current employer, was not admitted in\nevidence. The Government objected to the admission of the one-page exhibit because of the potential\nredundancy of the exhibit with Applicant\u2019s impending testimony (Tr. 14). I sustained the objection, and advised\nApplicant he could testify from the document when he presented his case. (Tr. 14-15, 22). \n2\nApplicant\u2019s undated answer to the SOR was received by DOHA on July 23, 2009.\nDOHA issued a Notice of Hearing on August 31, 2009, for a hearing on September 15,\n2009. The hearing was held as scheduled. At the hearing, four exhibits (GE 1 through 4)\nwere admitted in evidence without objection to support the government's case.\nApplicant testified and submitted six exhibits (AE A through AE, AE G and AE H).  The\n1\nrecord remained open until September 30, 2009 (Tr. 51), to allow Applicant an\nopportunity to submit additional evidence. Applicant submitted three exhibits (AE I\nthrough AE K). Those exhibits include documentation from the life insurance company\nprocessing his 401(k) loan application, a federal credit union statement dated\nSeptember 26, 2009, and Appellant\u2019s unsubstantiated statement that he paid off certain\ncreditors and his truck. DOHA received the transcript on September 22, 2009. The\nrecord closed on October 1, 2009.\nFindings of Fact\nThe SOR alleges financial considerations (Guideline F), based on seven debts.\nThe delinquent debts consist of two telephone accounts, two medical accounts, two\ncredit card accounts, and a mobile home repossession. The total for the six small past\ndue accounts (SOR 1.a. through 1.f.) is $3,678, and the larger repossession account\n(SOR 1.g.) is $33,173. The debts became delinquent between November 2005 and\nOctober 2008. Applicant admitted all the debts. \nApplicant is 37 years old. He has two daughters by his former wife who he\nmarried in July 1998 and divorced in September 2006. He pays $760 a month in child\nsupport for his two daughters (Tr. 32). He lives with his fiance and her four children. She\nreceives child support and Applicant supplements her support (Id.). His fiance is actively\nsearching for employment (Id.). \nSeveral months after high school, Applicant joined the United States Marine\nCorps (USMC) in October 1991 and received an honorable discharge in October 2004\n(AE H). In his 13 years of service, Applicant was assigned to duty locations all over the\nworld (Tr. 22). He was a drill instructor for several years, training approximately 90\nrecruits at periodic intervals to become better Marines (Id.). Applicant\u2019s last duty\nassignment from 2001 to 2004, was guarding nuclear weapons at the same military\nfacility where he has been employed for the past five years (Tr. 23). His commanding\nofficer (CO) for the last three years of Applicant\u2019s military service provided a letter of\nrecommendation in December 2004 extolling Applicant\u2019s service. The CO also signed\nApplicant\u2019s honorable discharge.\n\n3\nApplicant developed financial problems by allowing his former wife to handle the\nfinances (Tr. 30). His financial difficulties became worse when his former wife decided\nshe did not want to live in their mobile home (SOR 1.g.). In hopes of keeping the\nmarriage intact, Applicant rented a house and surrendered the mobile home to the\ndealer in 2006 (Tr. 28, 36, 38). The mobile home account (SOR 1.g.), which became\ndelinquent in November 2005, was treated as a repossession by the dealer, sold at\nauction, and Applicant was held responsible for the $33,173 balance (GE 4). \nApplicant stopped paying the other debts listed in the SOR because he did not\nhave the money, having moved several times around the time of the divorce (Tr. 29). He\nalso admitted he did not leave forwarding addresses for his creditors to keep in contact\nwith him (Id.; GE 3 at 1). \nIn his interrogatory answers submitted on April 20, 2009, Applicant\nacknowledged the overdue debts listed in the SOR, and that he wanted to pay them\n(GE 2). He also acknowledged an Internal Revenue Service (IRS) debt that he indicated\nhad been paid. That debt does not appear in the SOR or credit reports. In his SCA,\nApplicant disclosed the lien had been levied in July 2006, and he paid the lien off\nthrough a wage garnishment (GE 1 at 30).\nOn September 9, 2009, Applicant applied for a $7,000 loan from his 401 (k) plan\n(administered by a life insurance company) to pay off six of the seven debts listed in the\nSOR, and his truck (AE G). At the hearing, he confirmed his plan to obtain the loan (Tr.\n18, 31), and to hire an attorney to settle the mobile home account identified in SOR 1.g.\n(Tr. 25-26). The application was held up because the life insurance company stated that\nhe had to sign a Personal Loan and Spousal Consent Request Form confirming he was\nno longer married (Tr. 27). The finance company then directed him to return the form to\nreceive the loan (Id.). Applicant was advised by the company the form was in the mail,\nand he was waiting to receive it (Id.) \nOn September 21, 2009, Applicant signed the Personal Loan and Spousal\nConsent Request Form indicating he was not married (AE I). He had the form notarized.\nThe form verifies the loan amount and also indicates the loan figures were valid until\nOctober 10, 2009 (Id.). The federal credit union statement summary shows that as of\nSeptember 26, 2009, Applicant had two loans that had been closed out in a normal\nfashion (AE J). In AE K, Applicant provided an unsubstantiated statement indicating he\nsettled the accounts identified in SOR 1.a., 1.c., 1.d., and 1.f., and also paid off a $4,000\nbalance on a truck. The statement shows the total amount of funds used to settle the\nfour listed accounts and one unlisted account is $5,497 (Id.). \nHaving had a chance to listen to Applicant\u2019s testimony, observe his demeanor as\nhe testified, and weigh and balance his testimony with the other record exhibits, I find\nApplicant\u2019s testimony to be credible and worthy of belief. He realizes he must pay his\ndebts, and I find he has a plan to pay his debts. The only item missing is independent\nevidence establishing that these debts were paid. \n\n4\nCharacter Evidence\nApplicant provided several character references. The lieutenant colonel, who was\nthe CO during Applicant\u2019s military service between 2001 and his discharge in October\n2004, supplied a glowing endorsement of Appellant, particularly his expertise as an\nartisan (AE A). According to the CO, Applicant personally designed long-lasting fighting\nmodels to protect and preserve the security of strategic weapons (Id.). Applicant\u2019s\ncontributions as the Hazard Materials Officer was officially recognized by the Inspector\nGeneral of a component of the Marines. The CO praised Applicant\u2019s ability to transform\nmisfits into productive and goal-oriented Marines (Id.) \nApplicant\u2019s coworker of four years believes Applicant is reliable and trustworthy,\nand also a special friend (AE B). The shop lead has known Applicant for more than four\nyears and considers him a responsible team leader. The deputy facilities manager has\nknown Applicant for four years and respects the dedication and productivity in\nApplicant\u2019s job performance (AE D). \nThe morale, welfare, and recreation marketing director met Applicant in 2001 and\nworked with him for the next three years. Applicant was always ready to accommodate\nor assist in any way (AE E). After Applicant was discharged in 2004, he continued to\nhelp the morale recreation department. Applicant has demonstrated his reliability and\ndependability to the director (Id.) \nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant's suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). Each\nguideline lists potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are\nused in evaluating an applicant's eligibility for access to classified information. These\nguidelines are flexible rules of law that must take into consideration the complexities of\nhuman behavior. \nThe administrative judge's ultimate adjudicative goal is to reach a fair and\nimpartial decision that is based on common sense. The decision should also include a\ncareful, thorough evaluation of a number of variables known as the \"whole person\nconcept.\" Finally, the administrative judge must consider all available, reliable\ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a\ndecision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration.\nReasonable doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to classified\ninformation will be resolved in favor of national security. In reaching this decision, I have\ndrawn only those conclusions that are sensible, logical, and based on the evidence\ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere\nspeculation or conjecture.\n\n5\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.l.14., the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.l.l5., the applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \"witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\" The\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision.\nAnalysis\nFinancial Considerations\nAG \u00b6 18. The Concern. \"Failure or inability to live within one's means, satisfy\ndebts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about\nan individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. An\nindividual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to\ngenerate funds. Compulsive gambling is a concern as it may lead to financial crimes\nincluding espionage. Affluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is\nalso a security concern. It may indicate proceeds from financially profitable criminal\nacts.\"\nThere are two disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 19 that must be considered.\nAG \u00b6 19(a) (inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts) is applicable because Applicant\nowes more than $36,000 to seven creditors and is unable to pay the debt. AG \u00b6 19(c) (a\nhistory not meeting financial obligations) also applies as Applicant has accumulated\nseven delinquent debts since November 2005.\nThe first four mitigating conditions are potentially applicable. AG \u00b6 20(a) (the\nbehavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such\ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's\nreliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment) does not apply due the recency of a few\nof the delinquent accounts.\nApplicant receives some mitigation under AG \u00b6 20(b) (the conditions that resulted\nin the financial problem were largely beyond the person's control and the individual\nacted responsibly under the circumstances. It appears that Applicant went the \u201cextra\nmile\u201d to accommodate his former wife. In trying to save the marriage, he surrendered\nthe mobile home and rented a house. Applicant showed poor judgment by not posting\nhis forwarding addresses for creditors to maintain contact. He showed even more poor\njudgment by not taking any action to address his debts until September 2009. Even\nthough Applicant did not act \u201cresponsibly under the circumstances,\u201d he is entitled to\nsome mitigation under AG \u00b6 20(b).\nApplicant has had no financial counseling as defined by AG \u00b6 20(c) (the person\nhas received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear\nindications that the problem is being resolved or is under control). Even though there is\n\n6\nno independent evidence of payment of any of the creditors, I conclude Applicant\nreceived his loan as planned. Acquiring the funds to repay delinquent debts provides\nsome evidence that Applicant is trying to gain control over his delinquencies. \nAG \u00b6 20(d) (the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors\nor otherwise resolve debts) affords Applicant limited mitigation. It is clear that Applicant\napplied for the $7,000 loan and returned the follow-up forms to receive the loan. I find\nhe has presented sufficient evidence of obtaining a loan. I am also confident he will pay\nall of his delinquent debts. \nWhole Person Concept \nI have examined the evidence with the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in\nmy ultimate finding against Applicant under the financial guideline. I have also weighed\nthe circumstances within the context of nine variables known as the whole person\nconcept. In evaluating the relevance of an individual's conduct, the administrative judge\nshould consider the following factors:\nAG \u00b6 2(a) (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich the participation was voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and, (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nI have considered Applicant\u2019s 13-year military career. I have considered the\nformer CO\u2019s favorable remarks about Applicant\u2019s last tour of duty between 2001 and\n2004. I have also considered the consistently good reviews Applicant has received\nregarding his job performance over the last five years since his discharge. Applicant\ncredibly testified that he did not address his financial problems over the years because\nof his frequent residential moves and the fact that he ran out of money. I find that\nApplicant has taken the necessary steps to supply himself with sufficient funds to pay\nhis debts. I am also confident he will take the appropriate legal action to resolve his debt\nfor the mobile home. Accordingly, under the specific circumstances of this case, the\npositive character evidence from Applicant\u2019s former CO and his current coworkers and\nsupervisors, together with his credible testimony, the financial considerations guideline\nis found in Applicant\u2019s favor.\n\n7\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1 (Financial Considerations, Guideline F): FOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a.\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b.\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c.\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d.\nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.e.\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f.\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g.\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.

He currently has 22 \ndelinquent debts, and has failed to submit proof that any of them are satisfied. He has \nnot mitigated the Financial Considerations security concerns. Eligibility for access to \nclassified information is denied.  \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn November 30, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) \nissued a SOR to Applicant detailing security concerns under Guideline F, Financial \nConsiderations. The action was taken under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of \nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative \nguidelines (AG) effective within the Department of Defense on September 1, 2006.  \n \n \nApplicant answered the Statement of Reasons (SOR) in writing on December 30, \n2009, and elected to have the case decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. \nMarch 31, 2010\n\n \n2 \n \nDepartment Counsel submitted the Government\u2019s written case on January 14, 2010. A \ncomplete copy of the file of relevant material (FORM) was received by Applicant on \nJanuary 26, 2010. He was afforded a 30-day opportunity to file objections and submit \nmaterial to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the security concerns. As of March 26, 2010, \nhe had not responded. The case was assigned to me on March 30, 2010. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is a 42-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has worked for \nhis current employer since May 2004. Applicant served the United States Army from \n1992 through the present, on both active duty and in the inactive reserve, achieving the \nrank of Captain. He has a bachelor\u2019s degree, which was awarded in December 1991. \nHe is single with no children (Item 5; Item 6). \n \n \n Applicant has a long history of financial delinquencies. In October 1997, he filed \nfor Chapter 7 bankruptcy, which was dismissed (Item 6 at 6). He filed Chapter 13 \nbankruptcy in March 1999. The Chapter 13 was also dismissed, as Applicant was \nunable to make his payments (Item 7 at 5). During the same period, he purchased two \nvehicles, which were later repossessed (Item 14; Item 7). An April 2003 credit report \nshows Applicant had $86,454 in collection and charged-off accounts (Item 10). In an \nOctober 2004 statement to a Special Agent of the Defense Security Service, Applicant \nacknowledged \u201cmy credit issues are the result of a poor decision with personal \nrelationships, trying to help family members (mother and sister), and living beyond my \nmeans\u201d (Item 7 at 5). He further stated \u201cI do not intend to create bad debts in the future\u201d \n(Item 7 at 5).  \n \n \nThe SOR alleges 22 delinquent debts, which are all substantiated in the record \n(Item 10; Item 11; Item 12; Item 13). Applicant admitted all 22 debts alleged in SOR \ntotaling $85,057. He has not made payments on 16 of the accounts listed in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, \n1.f -1.o, 1.r, 1.s, 1.u, 1.v. However, he claims he has satisfied five debts stated in \u00b6\u00b6 1.c, \n1.d, 1.e, 1.q, and 1.t. totaling $3,271. He asserts that he is making payments on 1.p. \n \n Applicant claims that the debt in \u00b6 1.c owed to NCO Financial in the amount of \n$96 is paid. This debt has been past due since October 2005 (Item 12 at 14). Applicant \nincurred this debt when he failed to pay his Direct TV bill (Item 6 at 7, 15). Applicant \nclaims to have satisfied this debt in full by payment of a money order, but presented no \nproof of payment (Item 6 at 15). \n \nThe second debt Applicant claims is paid, listed in \u00b6 1.d, is owed on a medical \naccount in the amount of $50. This debt has been past due since October 2007 (Item 11 \nat 1). Applicant incurred this debt for a doctor\u2019s visit (Item 6 at 17). In his Answers to \nInterrogatories, Applicant claimed that it was his insurance company\u2019s responsibility to \npay this debt. He attached two account statements, each showing a bill of $50, along \nwith a letter to his human resources department. He offered no proof that the account \nhas, in fact, been resolved (Item 6 at 24-26). \n \n\n \n3 \n \nApplicant claims the debt in \u00b6 1.e, owed to PGT SNDCOL in the amount of about \n$141, is paid. This debt has been past due since April 2005 (Item 11 at 1). This debt \nwas originally owed to Lakewood Refuse (Item 11 at 1; Item 6 at 16). Applicant claims \nthat \u201cthis bill should be removed from my 1/23/09 CBR due to bill taken care of by \nLandlord\u2026\u201d (Item 6 at 16). He presented no documentation that this bill was satisfied by \nhis landlord or otherwise paid in full (Item 6 at 16; Answer). \n \n Applicant claims the debt listed in \u00b6 1.q owed to the State of Washington in the \namount of about $2,659 is paid (Item 12 at 4). This debt resulted from a tax lien filed in \nNovember 2005 (Answer). Applicant claims this debt was satisfied in full through \ngarnishment of his pay, but he presented no documentary evidence to substantiate this \nclaim (Answer). \n \n Applicant claims the debt listed in \u00b6 1.t owed to DPT Treasury in the amount of \nabout $325 is paid (Item 12 at 8; Answer). Applicant claims this debt was satisfied in full \nwith his tax refund in 2008, but presented no documentary evidence to substantiate this \nclaim (Answer). \n \n \nFurther, Applicant claims the $62,586 debt owed to DP of Education, listed in \u00b6 \n1.p, is being paid through garnishment of $497 per pay period since December 2009. \nThis debt is for a delinquent student loan used to finance Applicant\u2019s education \n(Answer; Item 5 at 37). He failed to produce documentation to show the garnishment. \nApplicant\u2019s Answer to the Interrogatories suggests that he has been making periodic \npayments on this debt. His claim is substantiated, in part, by a statement showing \ninterest paid on his student loan (Item 6 at 32-33). However, the statement fails to \nidentify the source of the payments. Applicant explained that past income tax refunds \nwere applied to this debt (Item 6 at 11). A July 2008 letter supposedly evidences \nadditional voluntary payments on this account, however, the letter does not show that \nany payments were actually made under the agreement, nor does it actively identify the \ncreditor to whom payments would be made (Item 6 at 34).  \n \n \n \nApplicant attributes some of his debts to various causes, including living beyond \nhis means (Item 7 at 5). He suggested that his former roommates may have engaged in \nidentity theft, causing some of the debts (Item 6 at 6). However, he failed to identify \nwhich debts were not his and he did not provide proof of identity theft. The record does \nnot reflect that he successfully contested any of his debts. \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \n\n \n4 \n \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to \npotential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern for Financial Considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n\n \n5 \n \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. Three are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n \n(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; \n \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and  \n \n(e) consistent spending beyond one\u2019s means, which may be indicated by \nexcessive indebtedness, significant negative cash flow, high debt-to-\nincome ratio, and/or financial analysis.  \n \n \nApplicant accumulated a number of delinquent debts and was unable or unwilling \nto pay his obligations. Further, his financial problems have been ongoing for at least the \npast 13 years, without resolution, while at the same time Applicant has continued to \nincur additional debts. The evidence is sufficient to raise the above disqualifying \nconditions. \n \n \n  \nFive Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control;  \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \n \nThe evidence does not show that Applicant has resolved any of the 22 debts \nalleged in the SOR. There is minimal evidence that some payments have been made on \nthe debt in \u00b6 1.p, however, there is no evidence of regular payments to this creditor. His \nfinancial issues are recent and ongoing. AG \u00b6 20(a) is not applicable.  \n\n \n6 \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b) is not applicable. Applicant attributed some of his financial problems \nto identity theft. However, he has not presented any documentation in support of this \nclaim. Further, to be fully applicable, AG \u00b6 20(b) also requires that the individual act \nresponsibly under the circumstances. Applicant has worked for his current employer \nsince May 2004. He did not submit evidence of any payments even on the smallest \ndebts. He did not present a plan on how he will address his delinquent debts, other than \nto indicate in his Answer that he has contacted some of his creditors. He did not contest \nthe debts. I am unable to make a determination that he acted responsibly under the \ncircumstances.  \n \n \nApplicant did not produce any evidence to suggest he attended any financial \ncounseling. Further, there is little indication that Applicant\u2019s delinquent accounts are \nbeing resolved or are under control. AG \u00b6 20(c) does not apply. \n \n \nApplicant has not made a good-faith effort to pay or resolve his delinquent debts. \nThe record establishes that payments have been made on only 1 of 22 debts. With \nrespect to \u00b6 1.p, Applicant\u2019s Answer suggests that this debt is now being paid through \ngarnishment of his wages and past payments were made at least partially through the \ngarnishment of his income tax refunds. The satisfaction of a debt through the \ninvoluntary establishment of a garnishment is not the same as a good-faith effort to \nrepay the debt. Further, he presented no evidence to support the garnishment. AG \u00b6 \n20(d) is not applicable. \n \n \nApplicant initially disputed owing a number of the debts alleged in the SOR, \nhowever, he admitted each debt in his Answer. Further, he presented no evidence to \nshow that he was in the process of disputing any debts or that he had successfully \ndisputed the debts in the past. AG \u00b6 20(e) is inapplicable.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n\n \n7 \n \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(a) were \naddressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional comment. I considered \nApplicant\u2019s service in the United States Army since 1992. However, Applicant is 42 \nyears old and is an educated man. He is clearly aware of the need to be financially \nresponsible. He has had ample opportunity to address his financial delinquencies, but \nhas failed to do so. \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has not mitigated Financial Considerations security concerns.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.v: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for \na security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n                                               \n \n \n \n________________________ \nJennifer I. Goldstein \nAdministrative Judge \n",

    "summary": "FINDINGS OF FACT The Applicant is 31 years old and is currently in her second year of college. She is employed by a defense contractor in dual positions as Administrative Support and Facility Security Officer and is seeking to obtain a security clearance in connection with her employment. The Government opposes the Applicant's request for a security clearance, on the basis of allegations set forth in the Statement of Reasons (SOR). The following findings of fact are entered as to each paragraph and guideline in the SOR: Paragraph 1 (Guideline F - Financial Considerations) The Government alleges that the Applicant is ineligible for clearance because she is financially overextended and at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. The Applicant served in the United States Army on active duty from February 2001 through February 2004. She served in the Army Reserves from February 2004 through March 2006. By choice, in April 2006, she returned to active duty until May 2007. Unexpectantly, the Applicant was medically discharged due to a pinched nerve in her spine and a condition known as \u201cPCIS\u201d that caused her to uncontrollably gain weight.

Goldstein, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\nNovember 24, 2009\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nLOKEY ANDERSON, Darlene D., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted her Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations Processing\n(e-QIP) on November 20, 2007.  (Government Exhibit 1).  On June 16, 2009, the\nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865\nand Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, (as\namended), issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant, which detailed\nreasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the\nDirective that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a\nsecurity clearance for the Applicant and recommended referral to an Administrative\nJudge to determine whether clearance should be denied or revoked.\nThe Applicant responded to the SOR on July 7, 2009, and she requested a\nhearing before a DOHA Administrative Judge.  This case was assigned to the\nundersigned on August 4, 2009.  A notice of hearing was issued on August 12, 2009,\nand the hearing was scheduled for September 22, 2009.  At the hearing the\nGovernment presented nine exhibits, referred to as Government Exhibits 1 through 9.\nThe Applicant presented two exhibits, referred to as Applicant\u2019s Exhibits A and B.  She\nalso testified on her own behalf.  The record remained open until close of business on\nSeptember 29, 2009, to allow the Applicant the opportunity to submit additional\n\n2\ndocumentation.  The Applicant submitted twelve Post-Hearing exhibits, consisting of\none hundred and one pages, referred to as Applicant\u2019s Post-Hearing Exhibits A though\nL, which was admitted without objection.  The official transcript (Tr.) was received on\nOctober 5, 2009.  Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and\ntestimony, eligibility for access to classified information is granted.\n FINDINGS OF FACT\nThe Applicant is 31 years old and is currently in her second year of college.  She\nis employed by a defense contractor in dual positions as Administrative Support and\nFacility Security Officer and is seeking to obtain a security clearance in connection with\nher employment.\nThe Government opposes the Applicant's request for a security clearance, on the\nbasis of allegations set forth in the Statement of Reasons (SOR).  The following findings\nof fact are entered as to each paragraph and guideline in the SOR:\nParagraph 1 (Guideline F - Financial Considerations)  The Government alleges that the\nApplicant is ineligible for clearance because she is financially overextended and at risk\nof having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.      \nThe Applicant served in the United States Army on active duty from February\n2001 through February 2004.  She served in the Army Reserves from February 2004\nthrough March 2006.  By choice, in April 2006, she returned to active duty until May\n2007.  Unexpectantly, the Applicant was  medically discharged due to a pinched nerve\nin her spine and a condition known as \u201cPCIS\u201d that caused her to uncontrollably gain\nweight.  She also has no cartilage in her knees and neuroma in both of her feet.  It  was\ndetermined that she is 60% disabled and will received disability benefits starting in\nNovember 2009, in the amount of $984.00 monthly.  (Applicant\u2019s Post-Hearing Exhibit\nJ).  Her husband, who was also active duty Army, was injured in Iraq, and was found no\nlonger fit for military duty.  He was medically discharged in January 2008, and will\nreceive disability.  These unforeseen circumstances caused financial difficulties for the\nApplicant. \nShe admits that she became indebted to two creditors totaling approximately\n$76,374.00.  These creditors are set forth in the SOR under allegations 1(a) and 1(b) of\nthe SOR.  Applicant takes full responsibility for her debts.  Credit reports of the\nApplicant dated April 8, 2009, September 6, 2008, March 9, 2009, June 2, 2009, July\n29, 2009, and September 22, 2009, reflect each of these delinquent debts as owing.\n(See Government Exhibits 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 9).  \nThe first debt in the amount of $7,199.00 is for a credit card that became overdue\nwhen the Applicant was medically discharged from the Army.  She destroyed the credit\ncard and in August 2009, entered into an agreement to resolve the debt in the amount\nof $100.00 monthly.  Applicant has recently increased the monthly payment to $150.00\n\n3\nmonthly.  The payment is automatically deducted from the Applicant\u2019s bank account.\nApplicant submitted receipts for payments made in January, June, July and August\n2009.  (Applicant\u2019s Post-Hearing Exhibit A).  She plans to continue with the payment\nplan until the debt is paid in full.  \nThe second debt in the amount of $69,175.00 is for a mortgage on a house the\nApplicant purchased in November 2004.  In March 2008, during which time both she\nand her husband were medically discharged from the Army, and out of work, the\nApplicant and her husband fell behind on their house payments.  The Applicant had\nnumerous discussions with the creditor concerning a loan modification, but was told by\nthe bank that her income was insufficient.  In November 2008, her house was\nforeclosed upon.  To the Applicant\u2019s knowledge the house has not been resold.\nApplicant has tried to contact the creditor to find out the exact payoff.  She indicates that\nshe will contact them, set up a payment plan and start paying on the balance to resolve\nthe debt. (Applicant\u2019s Post-Hearing Exhibit B).          \nLetters of recommendation from the Applicant\u2019s Human Resource Manager,\ncoworkers, and past employer, attest to the Applicant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness,\nhardworking nature, organization skills, strong moral character, conscientiousness and\ndedication to the job.  She is recommended for a position of trust.  (Applicant\u2019s Post-\nHearing Exhibit E).    \nApplicant has completed various military training courses and has received\nawards and commendations for her service.  (Applicant\u2019s Post-Hearing Exhibits G and\nH). \nApplicant has completed between 90% and 95% of her training for Facility\nSecurity Officer of the company, as evidenced by numerous certificates of completion in\nDepartment of Defense security awareness matters beginning in August 2008 and\ncontinuing through November 2009.  (Applicant\u2019s Post-Hearing Exhibit I).  \nApplicant\u2019s personal financial statement indicates that she and her husband\u2019s\nmonthly earnings, along with their vocational rehabilitation, and their disability, is\nsufficient to cover their monthly expenses and outstanding debts. \nPOLICIES\nEnclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudication policies divided into\n\"Disqualifying Factors\" and \"Mitigating Factors.\"  The following Disqualifying Factors\nand Mitigating Factors are found to be applicable in this case:\nGuideline F (Financial Considerations)\n18.  The Concern.  Failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to\nabide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s\nreliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information.  An individual who\n\n4\nis financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate\nfunds. \nConditions that could raise a security concern:\n19.(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; \n19.(c) a history of not meeting financial obligation; \nConditions that could mitigate security concerns:\n20.(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond\nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected\nmedical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual acted\nresponsibly under the circumstances;\n20.(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or\nthere are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control;\n20.(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or\notherwise resolve debts.\nIn addition, as set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive at pages 18-19,  in\nevaluating the relevance of an individual\u2019s conduct, the Administrative Judge should\nconsider the following general factors:\na.  The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding\ncircumstances;\n     b.  The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation;\nc.  The frequency and recency of the conduct;\nd.  The individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct;\ne.  The extent to which participation is voluntary;\nf.  The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavior\nchanges;\ng.  The motivation for the conduct; \nh. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress; and\n \ni.  The likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\n\n5\nThe eligibility criteria established in the DoD Directive identify personal\ncharacteristics and conduct which are reasonably related to the ultimate question,\nposed in Section 2 of Executive Order 10865, of whether it is \u201cclearly consistent with the\nnational interest\u201d to grant an Applicant\u2019s request for access to classified information.\nThe DoD Directive states, \u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a\nsufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the person is\nan acceptable security risk.  Eligibility for access to classified information is predicted\nupon the individual meeting these personnel security guidelines.  The adjudicative\nprocess is the careful weighing of a number of variables known as the whole person\nconcept.  Available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable\nand unfavorable should be considered in reaching a determination.\u201d The Administrative\nJudge can draw only those inferences or conclusions that have reasonable and logical\nbasis in the evidence of record.  The Judge cannot draw inferences or conclusions\nbased on evidence which is speculative or conjectural in nature.  Finally, as emphasized\nby President Eisenhower in Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under this order\n. . . shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a\ndetermination as to the loyalty of the Applicant concerned.\u201d\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn the defense industry, the security of classified industrial secrets is entrusted to\ncivilian workers who must be counted upon to safeguard such sensitive information\ntwenty-four hours per day, seven days per week.  The Government is therefore\nappropriately concerned when available information indicates that an Applicant for\nclearance may be involved in instances of financial irresponsibility which demonstrates\npoor judgment or unreliability.\nIt is the Government\u2019s responsibility to present substantial evidence to support\nthe finding of a nexus, or rational connection, between the Applicant\u2019s conduct and the\nholding of a security clearance.  If such a case has been established, the burden then\nshifts to the Applicant to go forward with evidence in rebuttal, explanation or mitigation\nwhich is sufficient to overcome or outweigh the Government\u2019s case.  The Applicant\nbears the ultimate burden of persuasion in proving that it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant him or her a security clearance.\nIn this case the Government has met its initial burden of proving that the\nApplicant has been financially irresponsible (Guideline F).  This evidence indicates poor\njudgment, unreliability and untrustworthiness on the part of the Applicant.  Because of\nthe scope and nature of the Applicant's conduct, I conclude there is a nexus or\nconnection with her security clearance eligibility.\nThe evidence shows that circumstances largely beyond the Applicant\u2019s control,\nnamely her unexpected medical discharge from the Army in April 2007, and her\nhusband\u2019s injury in Iraq that led to his military medical discharge in January 2008,\n\n6\nlargely caused their financial difficulties.  Their joint income was significantly reduced,\nand they were left unemployed.  Now, they have both found employment and are in a\nposition to resolve their debts. \nThe Applicant has made a good faith effort to resolve her past due indebtedness.\nShe has contacted each of the creditors and has either paid off the debt or is setting up\na payment plan to do so.  She does not plan on incurring any new debt.  She\nunderstands the importance of paying her bills on time and living within her means.\nUnder the circumstances, she has made a good faith effort to resolve his indebtedness,\nand there is evidence of financial rehabilitation.  The Applicant has demonstrated that\nshe can properly handle her financial affairs and that she is fiscally responsible.\nConsidering all of the evidence, the Applicant has introduced persuasive evidence in\nrebuttal, explanation or mitigation that is sufficient to overcome the Government's case. \nUnder Guideline F (Financial Considerations), Disqualifying Conditions 19.(a)\ninability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and 19.(c) a history of not meeting financial\nobligation apply.  However, Mitigating Conditions 20.(b) the conditions that resulted in\nthe financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of\nemployment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce\nor separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances, 20.(c) the\nperson has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear\nindications that the problem is being resolved or is under control and, 20.(d) the\nindividual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve\ndebts also apply.  Accordingly, I find for the Applicant under Guideline F (Financial\nConsiderations).    \nI have also considered the \u201cwhole person concept\u201d in evaluating the Applicant\u2019s\neligibility for access to classified information.  Under the particular facts of this case, the\ntotality of the conduct set forth above, when viewed under all of the guidelines as a\nwhole, support a whole person assessment of good judgement, trustworthiness,\nreliability, candor, and a  willingness to comply with rules and regulations, and/or other\ncharacteristics indicating that the person may properly safeguard classified information.\n  \nI have considered all of the evidence presented, including the favorable letters of\nrecommendation, military awards, military training certificates, medical documents\nverifying her and her husband\u2019s condition.  They mitigate the negative effects of her\nfinancial indebtedness and the effects that it can have on her ability to safeguard\nclassified information.  On balance, it is concluded that the Applicant has  overcome the\nGovernment's case opposing her request for a security clearance.  Accordingly, the\nevidence supports a finding for the Applicant as to the factual and conclusionary\nallegations expressed in Paragraph 1 of the SOR.   \n\n7\n     \nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal findings For or Against the Applicant on the allegations in the SOR, as\nrequired by Paragraph 25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive are:\nParagraph 1: \nFor the Applicant.\n    \n    Subpara.  1.a.:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.b.:\nFor the Applicant.\n  \n   \nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the\nApplicant.\n  Darlene Lokey Anderson\nAdministrative Judge\n",

DOHA acted under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of\nDefense (DOD) Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance\nReview Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative\nguidelines (AG) effective within the Department of Defense on September 1, 2006. \n \nOn October 10, 2009, Applicant answered the SOR, and requested a hearing.\nShe admitted the factual allegations in SOR \u00b6 1.a through 1.o, 1.r, 1.t. and 1.u. She\ndenied the remaining allegations. DOHA assigned the case to me on February 2, 2010.\nDOHA issued a Notice of Hearing on February 24, 2010, and I convened the hearing as\nscheduled on March 25, 2010. Department Counsel offered eight exhibits, which were\nadmitted as Government Exhibits (GE) 1-8, without objection. Applicant testified on her\nown behalf and offered five exhibits, which were admitted as Applicant Exhibits (AE) A-\nE. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on March 30, 2010. Based upon a review of the\nApril 2, 2010\n\n2\ncase file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified\ninformation is granted.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 53-year-old employee of a defense contractor. After graduating\nfrom high school in 1974, she attended a community college. She earned her\nundergraduate degree in 2003. In 2005, Applicant received a Master of Business\ndegree. (AE E.) She earned outstanding grades in both programs. She has been with\nher current employer since September 2008. (GE 1.) Applicant has held an interim\nsecurity clearance since the beginning of the 2008 employment.\nApplicant married in August 1980. As a result of that marriage, she had four\nchildren. Applicant raised her four children as a single parent, because her husband left\nthe family in 1988 (Tr. 27.) He did not provide any child support. (Tr. 54.) Applicant had\nno contact with her husband. They divorced in 2007. Applicant worked when she could,\nbut was forced to accept state assistance to provide for her family until approximately\n1996.\nApplicant secured permanent employment starting in approximately 1995. (AE\nD.) During the evenings, she started taking more college classes in order to obtain an\nundergraduate degree, which would increase job opportunities. She worked as an\nadministrative assistant from December 1996 until November 2001. (GE 1.) During this\ntime, she continued to support her family and to send her children to college. (Tr. 27.)\nIn 2001, Applicant obtained a position as an Executive Assistant with a new\ncompany. She continued to take college courses in the evening. At this time, Applicant\nobtained student loans to finance her education. (Tr. 55.) Her employer agreed to\nreimburse her for her tuition costs (Tr. 27.) While they did not have a written agreement,\neach year her employer assured her during her annual review that when her student\nloans became due, the company would provide the finances to pay for them. (Tr. 48.)\nIn 2007, Applicant\u2019s employer experienced financial difficulty. (Tr. 28.) A new\nmanagement team took over the company. Applicant was not retained as an employee,\nand was unemployed from November 2007 until June 2008. Applicant was never given\nany tuition reimbursement. She was now fully responsible for the student loans. The\ndeferred loans defaulted, and Applicant did not have the income to begin paying on\nthem.\nThe SOR alleges 21 delinquent debts totaling over of $75,000. (GE 5.) The\ncurrent status of Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts is described below.\nThe debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a ($505), 1.p ($96); 1.q ($121); and 1.s ($106)\nare paid in full. (AE B.)\n\n3\nThe debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, through 1.o, are student loans ($75,000) which\nhave been consolidated. (AE A.) Applicant\u2019s monthly payments are $360. Prior to the\nloan consolidation, Applicant completed a \u201crehabilitation program\u201d and paid $421\nmonthly for approximately ten months. \nThe debt alleged in SOR 1.r ($306) is a medical bill that Applicant recently\nlearned about. She is in the process of paying it.  \nThe debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.t ($799) is a utility bill. Applicant entered into a\npayment plan. The monthly payments are $50. The current balance is $449. (Tr. 23.)\nApplicant is current with her monthly payment. (Tr. 23.)\nThe debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.u ($1,496) is a hospital bill. Applicant entered into a\npayment plan. The monthly payments are $50. Her current balance is $996. (AE C.)\nApplicant received financial counseling, and worked with various credit\ncounseling agencies to assist her with her budget development and payment plans. She\nwas not successful in obtaining a loan to pay off the delinquent debts that are not\nstudent loans. (Tr. 16.) She has been successful with her payment plans that are in\nplace. \nApplicant\u2019s net monthly income is approximately $2,200. (Tr. 41.) This does not\ninclude her new husband\u2019s net monthly income of approximately $3,000. Applicant\u2019s\nhusband supports the household. Applicant puts most of her income into their joint\naccount. She keeps some money to pay her remaining debt. She is current with her\nmonthly expenses. Applicant has no credit cards. She has no car payment. Her recent\ncredit reports confirm that she \u201cpays as agreed\u201d on her accounts.\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief\nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially\ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which must be considered in\nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2,\nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the\n\u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable\ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a\ndecision.\n\n4\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based\non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship\ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government\nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk\nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information.\nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to\npotential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order (EO) 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin\nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty\nof the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple\nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).\nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set\nout in AG & 18:      \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nAG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.\nSimilarly under AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise\nsecurity concerns. Applicant accumulated delinquent debts on several accounts,\n\n5\nincluding student loans. Her credit reports confirm the debts. The evidence is sufficient\nto raise these disqualifying conditions.\nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security\nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG \u00b6 20(a), the disqualifying condition\nmay be mitigated where Athe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or\noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt\non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ Applicant\naccumulated delinquent debt while going to school to gain better employment\nopportunities. She also believed that her company would help pay for the tuition.\nApplicant was a single parent raising four children. They are now adults. She is recently\nremarried. She has paid several of the delinquent debts. She has a consolidated\nstudent loan. She is in a stable financial situation. There is no likelihood that future debt\nwill occur. The vast majority of the delinquent debts reported on her credit reports were\nthe result of the student loans. This mitigating condition applies.  \nUnder AG & 20(b), the disqualifying condition may be mitigated where Athe\nconditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person=s\ncontrol (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical\nemergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual acted responsibly\nunder the circumstances.@ Applicant\u2019s husband left her in 1988. She had to accept\nassistance in the earlier years but she found employment. She attended college at\nnight. She worked steadily and until 2007, she did not have any financial difficulties. The\nloss of her position in 2007 and the lack of tuition reimbursement were the main cause\nof her delinquent debts. Applicant acted responsibly in paying her accounts under the\ncircumstances. This mitigating condition applies.\nEvidence that Athe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control@\nis potentially mitigating under AG & 20(c). Similarly, AG & 20(d) applies where the\nevidence shows Athe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or\notherwise resolve debts.@ Applicant received formal financial counseling. She worked\nwith several firms to help her develop a budget and a payment plan. She has a\nconsolidated student loan. She has paid the smaller accounts. Her efforts are sufficient\nto carry her burden on those debts which are hers. I conclude these mitigating\nconditions apply.\nWhole-Person Concept\nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\n\n6\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole person concept. \n   \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case and conclude they are sufficient to\novercome the government\u2019s case. \nApplicant is a well-educated professional. She was a single parent for 20 years\nand educated her children. She had no support from her ex-husband. She attended\ncollege at night for many years. In 2005, she earned an advanced degree (MBA). She is\na role model for her family. She earns a good salary and is financially stable. She paid\n$421 monthly for ten months, and is now on a $360 per month payment plan for her\nstudent loan consolidation program. Her student loans, which constitute the\noverwhelming bulk of her debts are in current status. She remarried in 2007, and her\nhusband\u2019s income helps with household expenditures. She obtained financial\ncounseling and has been very responsible in dealing with her financial situation.\nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts about\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I\nconclude Applicant has mitigated the security concerns arising under financial\nconsiderations. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a: through 1.u:\nFor Applicant\n\n7\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.\n                                              \n_________________\nNOREEN A. LYNCH\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Applicant\u2019s \neligibility for a security clearance is denied. \n \nOn December 4, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) \nissued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns \nunder Guidelines E, F, and H. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and \neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on December 14, 2009, and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on January 19, 2010. \nDOHA issued a notice of hearing on January 20, 2010, and I convened the hearing as \n \n1 \n \n \nMarch 26, 2010\n\n \n2 \n \n \n                                                          \nscheduled on February 16, 2010. The government offered Exhibits (GE) 1 through 10. \nApplicant did not object and they were admitted. Applicant testified and offered \nApplicant\u2019s Exhibits (AE) A through N. They were admitted without objection. DOHA \nreceived the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on February 22, 2010.  \n \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant admitted SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c,1 1.d, 1.e, 1.f, 1.g, 2.a, 2.b, 2.e, 2.i, 2.j, and 3.a. \nShe denied the remaining allegations. After a thorough and careful review of the \npleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of fact. \n \nApplicant is 30 years old. She graduated from high school in 1997 and married in \n1998. She has two children, ages seven and eleven. She has taken colleges courses \nsince 1996, and needs three credits to complete the requirements for her bachelor\u2019s \ndegree. In April 1999, she enlisted in the Air Force. She was honorably discharged in \nApril 2005, in the rank of staff sergeant (E-5). From February 2000 to approximately \nSeptember 2005, she held a Top Secret security clearance and was eligible for access \nto sensitive compartmented information (SCI). After Applicant was discharged from the \nAir Force, she accepted employment as a civilian in the same office she had worked \nwhile on active duty. As a civilian, she was required to switch her security clearance \nfrom the Air Force to the new government agency (Agency). The Agency required \nApplicant submit a new security clearance application (SCA) and take a polygraph.2  \n \nApplicant submitted a SCA on September 29, 2005.3 On it she responded \u201cNo\u201d to \nQuestion 27, asking if she had illegally used a controlled substance since the age of 16 \nor in the last seven years, whichever is shorter. She responded \u201cNo\u201d to Question 28, \nwhich asked if she had ever illegally used a controlled substance while possessing a \nsecurity clearance.4  \n \nOn October 19, 2005, Applicant was interviewed, as part of her polygraph \nexamination. During the interview she admitted she had used marijuana on two \noccasions between the spring of 1996 and January 1999. During the interview she did \nnot initially disclose other drug use until after further questioning. She then admitted she \nwas not completely honest about her drug involvement. She admitted she used Ecstasy \none time in November 2004. She withheld the information because she did not want to \ndisclose that she had used illegal drugs while possessing a Top Secret security \n \n1 Applicant admitted she answered \u201cNo\u201d, and she knew and sought to conceal information set forth in \nsubparagraph 3.a. She denied she sought to conceal information set forth in subparagraph 3.b. \n \n2 Tr. 26-35. \n \n3 GE 3. \n \n4 Tr. 45. \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \n                                                          \nclearance and while assigned by the Air Force to the Agency.5 In November 2005, \nApplicant was denied access to SCI by the Agency due to the above information.6  \n \nApplicant signed an Agency Personnel Security Policy Advisory on September \n15, 2004, verifying she understood and was willing to comply with their policies. Part of \nthat agreement was the Agency\u2019s policy of strictly prohibiting the illegal use of controlled \nsubstances.7  \n \nApplicant\u2019s first marijuana use was with friends in 1996. Her second marijuana \nuse in 1999 was also with friends and her husband. Applicant stated that she thought \nthis use might have been in 1997, instead of 1999. She used Ecstasy in 2004, with her \nhusband, who was also on active duty at the time, and with other military friends. She \nstated her military friends also held security clearances. Applicant stated she made a \nterrible mistake by using an illegal drug while holding a security clearance. She has not \nused illegal drugs since then and has no intention of using them again in the future.8  \n \nAt her hearing, Applicant stated she thought the date she used Ecstasy was in \n2003, rather than November 2004, and her last marijuana use was 1997, instead of \n1999. The dates that Applicant used both marijuana and Ecstasy were provided by her \nto the Agency investigator. Her interview was on October 19, 2005, less than a year \nafter she stated she used Ecstasy. I have considered her retraction of the dates, and \nfind the dates she provided to the investigator are likely to be more accurate than her \nrecent memories of the dates.9   \n \nApplicant completed a SCA on May 28, 1999. In response to Question 27, asking \nif she had illegally used a controlled substance in the past seven years or since she was \n16 years old, which ever was shorter, she answered \u201cNo.\u201d She failed to list her two \nmarijuana uses on this SCA. When asked why she failed to disclose her drug uses she \nstated she had no explanation.10 \n \nApplicant also answered \u201cNo\u201d to Question 20 on her SCA dated May 28, 1999, \nwhich asked if she had been terminated or left a job under unfavorable circumstances. It \nwas alleged that she was fired from a restaurant in 1996. Applicant provided documents \n \n5 Tr. 34-36, 51-52; GE 6. \n \n6 Tr. 31-33, 122-128. \n \n7 GE 6. \n \n8 Tr. 25, 45-51. \n \n9 Tr. 35-42,122-126; GE 8. \n \n10 Tr. 128-132. \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \n                                                          \nsubstantiating that she was not fired or terminated, nor did she leave under unfavorable \ncircumstances.11 \n \nApplicant\u2019s husband was discharged from the Army in June 2006 and remained \nin the reserves. He was recalled to active duty in April 2007, and was discharged in July \n2007. After he was discharged, he had difficulty finding full-time employment until April \n2008. He was only able to work odd jobs during that period, and the lack of income \nnegatively impacted the family\u2019s financial situation. He handled the family\u2019s finances. \nApplicant was aware that they were experiencing financial problems, but did not know \nthe extent of the problem until October 2008, when she was interviewed by an \ninvestigator from the Office of Personnel Management (OPM). When Applicant \ncompleted a SCA on January 30, 2008, she did not disclose she had delinquent debts \nthat were more than 180 days delinquent or 90 days past due. I find Applicant did not \nintentionally fail to disclose her delinquent debts. I found her credible and believe that \nshe was unaware of the extent of her family\u2019s delinquent debts when she completed the \nSCA.12  \n \nApplicant stated that upon learning of the extent of their delinquent debts, she \nand her husband made a plan to reduce their expenses by moving to a residence where \nthey paid less rent and utilities and budgeted their monthly expenditures to the \u201cbare \nbones.\u201d Applicant\u2019s husband also was able to adjust his work hours so they would have \nless daycare costs. Beginning in June 2009, they began applying approximately $3,500, \nalmost all of their excess income after paying their monthly expenses, towards reducing \ntheir delinquent debt.13  \n \nThe debt in SOR \u00b6 2.a ($621) was settled for $400 and paid in January 2010.14  \n \nThe debt in SOR \u00b6 2.b ($4,923) is a disputed utility bill. Applicant has disputed \nthis bill in the past. The bill would change dramatically by thousands of dollars from one \nmonth to the next. She requested the creditor conduct an investigation regarding the \nbill, and they determined there was an error in the account. The debt was removed from \nApplicant\u2019s credit report.15 \n \nThe debt in SOR \u00b6 2.c ($1,519) is for a telephone bill. It was disputed and \nsettled. Applicant paid $683 in December 2009, and the debt is resolved.16 \n \n11 Answer. \n \n12 Tr. 24-25, 53-63, 116-117. \n \n13 Tr. 25-26, 64-74. \n \n14 Tr. 74-75; AE H, J. \n \n15 Tr. 75-81; AE M, N. \n \n16 Tr. 81-83; AE B. \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \n                                                          \nThe debt in SOR \u00b6 2.d ($6,372) is a charged-off credit card account. Applicant \nmade a settlement offer. The offer was accepted and Applicant is required to pay \n$3,186 in two equal installment payments in February and March 2010 to satisfy the \ndebt. At the time of her hearing she intended to pay the settlement.17 \n \nThe debt in SOR \u00b6 2.e ($2,205) is a debt for a computer Applicant purchased in \n2005. She stated she made an offer to pay the full amount in two installments beginning \nin April 2010. She had not yet received a response to her offer.18 \n \nThe debt in SOR \u00b6 2.f ($10,172) is for a repossessed car that Applicant and her \nhusband purchased in 2005. Their payments became delinquent in June or July 2008, \nwhen Applicant\u2019s husband had difficulty finding a job. They began making monthly \npayments in August 2009 and pay between $400 and $900 a month. They intend to \ncontinue making payments until the debt is satisfied.19 \n \nThe debt in SOR \u00b6 2.g ($21,651) is a consolidated loan that was obtained in \n2006 to pay for a car and other debts. The original loan was for $25,000. Applicant \nmade payments on the loan, reducing the balance the balance to approximately \n$19,000, before it became delinquent. She completed a repayment schedule in \nSeptember 2009, and settled the debt for $9,744.20 \n \nThe debt in SOR \u00b6 2.h ($3,539) was for a credit card. The debt was settled for \n$2,100, and paid in two installments in December 2009 and January 2010.21 \n \nThe debt in SOR \u00b6 2.i ($892) was for bank overdrafts. Applicant settled and paid \n$642 to resolve the debt.22 \n \nThe debt in SOR \u00b6 2.j ($860) is for student fees from a college Applicant \nattended. She intends to pay the debt in May 2010.23  \n \nThe debt in SOR \u00b6 2.k ($591) is for student fees from a college Applicant \nattended. She has paid the debt.24  \n \n17 Tr. 83-86, 114-115; AE G. \n \n18 Tr. 86-89. \n \n19 Tr. 89-91; AE A, I. \n \n20 Tr. 91-94; AE C. \n \n21 Tr. 94-96; AE D, E. \n \n22 Tr. 96-97; AE K. \n \n23 Tr. 97-99. \n \n24 Tr. 99-100; AE F. \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \n                                                          \nApplicant has approximately $13,000 in student loans that are deferred. She \nstated she has always paid her loans on time and never defaulted. She and her \nhusband have received financial counseling through her husband\u2019s employer. They use \na financial software program to keep track of their budget and expenses. Applicant and \nher husband intend on paying all of their delinquent debts. She maintains only one store \ncredit card that has a minimal balance.25  \n \nThe following documents were included in Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR and \nwere considered: verification she was a volunteer for the county and passed a \nbackground investigation, a letter of recommendation from her supervisor, performance \nappraisal, documents from her college, showing her grades and that she was on the \nDean\u2019s List.26 \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \n25 Tr. 100-110. \n \n26 Answer to SOR. \n\n \n7 \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern pertaining to personal conduct:  \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.  \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. I have specifically considered:  \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; and \n \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress, such \nas (1) engaging activities which, if known, may affect the person\u2019s \npersonal, professional, or community standing. \n \nI have considered Applicant\u2019s testimony and conclude that she was unaware of \nher family\u2019s financial situation when she failed to disclose she had delinquent debts over \n180 days and 90 days past due on her 2005 SCA. I have also reviewed the evidence \nand conclude Applicant was not terminated from employment under unfavorable \ncircumstances. I find none of the disqualifying conditions apply to these allegations. \n\n \n8 \n \n \nApplicant intentionally and deliberately failed to disclose on her SCA in 1999 and \nagain in 2005, that she had used marijuana in the past. She also failed to disclose on \nher 2005 SCA that she used Ecstasy in November 2004, while she held a Top Secret \nsecurity clearance and access to SCI. In September 2004, she signed an Agency policy \nagreement to refrain from using illegal drugs. She did not disclose her past drug use \nuntil she was confronted by an investigator. I find both of the above disqualifying \nconditions apply.  \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from personal conduct. I have considered all of the mitigating \nconditions under AG \u00b6 17 and especially considered the following: \n \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts;  \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under unique circumstances that it is unlikely \nto recur, and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, \nor other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur;  \n \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress; and \n \n(g) association with persons involved in criminal activity has ceased or \noccurs under circumstances that do not cast doubt upon the individual\u2019s \nreliability, trustworthiness, judgment, or willingness to comply with rules \nand regulations.  \n \nApplicant intentionally misled the government when she failed to disclose illegal \ndrug use on her 1999 SCA. She intentionally failed to disclose her prior marijuana use \nand her use of Ecstasy on her 2005 SCA, again misleading the government. She did \nnot disclose her past drug use until she was confronted by an investigator. She \ncontinued to mislead the government and it was not until she was interviewed and was \nto be polygraphed, that she disclosed her drug use. Having served on active duty for six \nyears, she was well aware of the military\u2019s policy on illegal drug use. Although she \nchanged the date from the one provided during her interview, stating she used Ecstasy \nin 2003 instead of 2004, the date is a matter in aggravation because of the proximity of \nwhen she signed the Agency\u2019s drug policy statement. The real concern is while holding \na Top Secret security clearance and access to SCI, and working with classified material, \nshe used Ecstasy. She did this while on active duty, with her husband, who was also on \n\n \n9 \n \n \nactive duty, and with other military members. She risked potentially being court-\nmartialed or administratively separated under other than honorable conditions.  \n \nApplicant did not promptly correct the omission. To the contrary, she continued to \nperpetuate the false information for many years and did not divulge it until she was \ngoing to be subjected to a polygraph. I find mitigating condition (a) does not apply. The \noffenses are not minor. She failed to disclose her drug use twice on SCAs. Her use of \nan illegal drug while she held a Top Secret security clearance is serious misconduct. \nThese actions cast doubt on her good judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. I find \nmitigating condition (c) does not apply. I have considered mitigating condition (d) and \nfind that Applicant acknowledges her mistake in using illegal drugs while she held a \nsecurity clearance, and it is unlikely she will use illegal drugs in the future. She realizes \nthe magnitude of her mistake. However, she used Ecstasy after she had served four to \nfive years in the Air Force. She was a staff sergeant and used it with her husband and \nother military friends. She then lied about her use on her SCA. I find insufficient \nevidence was presented to conclude mitigating condition (d) applies. Applicant has \nacknowledged her mistakes, in both using Ecstasy, while holding a security clearance, \nand lying about all of her prior drug use. Other than her husband, it is unclear who else \nknows about her illegal drug use while holding a security clearance and lying on her \nSCAs. I am unaware of the steps Applicant has taken to reduce her vulnerability to \nexploitation, manipulation, or duress. I find mitigating condition (e) does not apply. \nApplicant used drugs with her husband in 1999 and again 2004. She stated she no \nlonger associates with the Air Force personnel with whom she used Ecstasy. However, \nshe and her husband remain married and two of the three times she used drugs were \nwith him. I find the circumstances of her use of Ecstasy and her failures to disclose her \ndrug use cast doubts on her reliability, trustworthiness, judgment, and willingness to \ncomply with rules and regulations. Therefore, I find mitigating condition (g) does not \napply.   \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG & 18:  \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. I have \nconsidered all of the disqualifying conditions under AG & 19 and especially considered: \n \n(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and \n\n \n10 \n \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \nAppellant had ten delinquent debts totaling more than $48,000. She was unable \nor unwilling to address the debts until recently. I find there is sufficient evidence to raise \nthe above disqualifying conditions.  \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. I have considered the following mitigating \nconditions under AG \u00b6 20: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control;  \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \nApplicant\u2019s behavior is recent because she is still resolving her financial \ndelinquencies. I find mitigating condition (a) does not apply. Applicant\u2019s husband was \nunemployed for a period of time, after he was discharged from active duty. His lack of \nincome in a family accustomed to two salaries created a financial hardship. Although he \nworked odd jobs and temporary jobs, his salary was not enough. He did not tell \nApplicant about their financial problems. He obtained a full-time job in April 2008, and \ntogether they have been resolving their delinquent debts. They have received financial \ncounseling through Applicant\u2019s husband\u2019s employer. They reduced their expenses by \nmoving to a home that costs less. They are using almost all of their expendable income \nto pay their delinquent debts. They have settled and paid most of their debts and are \naddressing the remaining debts. I find there are clear indications the problem is being \nresolved and Applicant has made good-faith efforts to resolve their debts. I also find she \nhas a reasonable dispute in SOR \u00b6 2.b. The debt is no longer on her credit reports. I \nfind mitigating conditions (b), (c), (d) and (e) apply.  \n\n \n11 \n \n \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement \n \nAG \u00b6 24 expresses the security concern pertaining to drug involvement:  \nUse of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because it may \nimpair judgment and because it raises questions about a person's ability \nor willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. Drugs are \ndefined as mood and behavior altering substances, and include: (1) \nDrugs, materials, and other chemical compounds identified and listed in \nthe Controlled Substances Act of 1970, as amended (e.g., marijuana or \ncannabis, depressants, narcotics, stimulants, and hallucinogens), and (2) \ninhalants and other similar substances; Drug abuse is the illegal use of a \ndrug or use of a legal drug in a manner that deviates from approved \nmedical direction. \n \nI have considered the disqualifying conditions under Drug Involvement AG \u00b6 25 \nand especially considered the following: \n \n(a) any drug abuse; \n \n(c) illegal drug possession, including cultivation, processing, manufacture, \npurchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of drug paraphernalia; and \n \n(g) any illegal drug use after being granted a security clearance. \n \nAppellant used marijuana twice in the 1990s. She used Ecstasy one time in \neither 2003 or 2004, while she held a Top Secret security clearance and access to SCI. \nIn order to use it she must have possessed the drugs. I find all of the above \ndisqualifying conditions apply.  \n \nI have considered all of the mitigating conditions under Drug Involvement AG \u00b6 \n26 and especially considered the following: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent or happened \nunder circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on \nthe individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n \n(b) a demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future, such as (1) \ndisassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; (2) changing or \navoiding the environment where drugs were used; (3) an appropriate \nperiod of abstinence; (4) a signed statement of intent with automatic \nrevocation of clearance for any violation. \n \n \nApplicant used marijuana when she was young and prior to entering the Air \nForce. She used Ecstasy on active duty in the Air Force, as a staff sergeant, with her \nhusband and other military personnel, and while holding a security clearance. There is \n\n \n12 \n \n \nno evidence Applicant has used illegal drugs since 2004, or that she is drug dependant \nor an abuser. She credibly testified that her actions were a mistake and she never \nintends to use illegal drugs again. She has abstained from illegal drug use for at least \nsix years, a significant period of abstinence. She used the Ecstasy with her husband, \nand they remain married. I find under the circumstances, he too has learned the \nseriousness of their actions and contact with him does not cause a concern. Applicant \nalso understands the seriousness of her conduct and its ramifications on her career. \nShe has demonstrated an intention not to use drugs in the future. I do not believe \nApplicant has a drug problem. Therefore, I find both mitigating conditions (a) and (b) \napply.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant served in the Air Force for \nfive years and was honorably discharged. She is a good student and a valued \nemployee. Applicant and her husband had financial difficulties when he was discharged \nfrom active duty and could not find a job. They accumulated delinquent debts. They \nhave been aggressively resolving their debts and have settled most of them. The few \nremaining debts, they have plans to resolve. Applicant failed to disclose on her SCA in \n1999, that she had used illegal drugs in her past. She knew the information was false. \nShe used Ecstasy while she was on active duty and holding a Top Secret security \nclearance. When completing her 2005 SCA, after being released from active duty, she \nfailed to disclose all of her prior illegal drug use. Her use prior to enlisting can be \nattributed to youthful indiscretion. Although I do not believe Applicant has a drug \nproblem or that she will use illegal drugs in the future, her disregard for the rules while \nmaintaining a security clearance, cannot be overlooked or attributed to her youth. She \nwas holding a responsible job at the time, and was trusted in having access to classified \n\n \n13 \n \n \n                                                          \nmaterial. Her repeated failure to disclose her drug use on her SCAs causes concern \nabout her honesty and trustworthiness. It was not until she was confronted at her \ninterview prior to a polygraph that she finally told the truth. Overall, the record evidence \nleaves me with serious questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability \nfor a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant mitigated the \nsecurity concerns arising under Guideline F, Financial Considerations, and Guideline H, \nDrug Involvement, but failed to mitigate the security concerns under Guideline E, for \nPersonal Conduct.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline E:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs: 1.a-1b: \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs: 1.c-1.d: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph:   1.e: \n \n \nFor Applicant27 \n \n \nSubparagraph:   1.f:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph    1.g: \n \n \nFor Applicant28 \n \n \nSubparagraphs: 1.h: \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph    1.i:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline F:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubpargraphs   2.a-2.k: \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \nParagraph 3, Guideline H:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs  3.a-3.b: \n \n \nFor Applicant  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n27 This is a factual allegation that Applicant had no control over. The fact she was previously denied \naccess to SCI is not a disqualifying condition.  \n \n28 This allegation alleges the same conduct as SOR \u00b6 1.f, and is therefore redundant. \n\n \n14 \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nCarol G.

On April 23, 2010, the Defense Office of \nHearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) \ndetailing security concerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations). The action \nwas taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, \nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) effective within the \nDepartment of Defense on September 1, 2006.  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on May 11, 2010. Applicant requested his \ncase be decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing.  \n \nOn July 1, 2010, Department Counsel submitted DOHA=s written case. A \ncomplete copy of the file of relevant material (FORM) was provided to the Applicant. He \nSeptember 29, 2010\n\n \n \n \n \n \n2\nwas given the opportunity to file objections and submit material in refutation, \nextenuation, and mitigation. Applicant received the file on July 12, 2010. Applicant filed \na timely Response to the FORM on July 27, 2010. I received the case assignment on \nAugust 6, 2010. Applicant continued to submit exhibits on August 26, 2010, September \n1, 2010, and September 8, 2010. Department Counsel had no objection to the response \nor the additional submissions. I marked all documents as Exhibits 1 to 21. The record \nclosed on September 8, 2010. Based upon a review of the complete case file, \npleadings, and exhibits, eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant admitted all allegations in the SOR. He provided additional information \nin support of his application for a security clearance. (Items 2 and 5)  \n \n \nApplicant is 40 years old, married, and has one child. He works for a defense \ncontractor. Applicant\u2019s family lives in another country and he sends his wife $1,000 \nmonthly to support them. (Items 4, 5) \n \n \nApplicant has nine delinquent debts totaling $37,758. These debts started to \naccumulate in 2001. The latest debt became delinquent in 2009. He has paid seven \ndebts by settlements, payment in full, or installment payment agreements.

Applicant  \n \n \n   contacted the creditor. (Items 5-9, Exhibit 2) \n \n \n \n4. Applicant owes $2,676 to a credit card company (SOR Para.1.d). \n \n \n    He has an installment payment arrangement with the creditor to \n \n \n    pay $150 monthly and started doing so in August 2010.

Applicant owes the military credit card $3,958 (SOR Para. 1.g). \n \n \n     He paid this debt. The creditor submitted written verification the \n \n \n     debt is resolved. (Items 5-9, Exhibits 6, 10) \n \n \n \n8. Applicant owes another debt to the credit card issuer listed \n \n \n    in SOR Para. 1.d. This debt is for $3,958. The debt is being resolved \n \n \n    by an installment agreement. (Items 5-9, Exhibits 2, 12, 19) \n \n \n \n9. Applicant owes a debt collector $822 for two debts owed to a  \n \n \n    department store. These debts were paid in a settlement agreement \n \n \n    in April 2009. The amounts paid were $640.79 and $363.99. These \n \n \n    debts are resolved. (Items 5-9, Exhibits 2, 3, 5,17, 18)  \n \n \nApplicant submitted his telephone records for July and August 2010, to show his \nefforts made in contacting his creditors to resolve these debts. He did make several \ntelephone calls to the creditors in that monthly billing period. (Exhibit 7)  \n \n \nApplicant submitted four character statements. They are all favorable. Applicant \nhas worked for his employer since September 2004. His character references regard \nhim as honest and trustworthy. Applicant is also considered to have high moral \nstandards and dedicated to his job and family. (Exhibits 8, 13-15) \n \nPolicies \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant=s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an applicant=s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, the administrative judge applies the guidelines in \n\n \n \n \n \n \n4\nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge=s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG & 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the Awhole-person concept.@ The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG & 2(b) \nrequires that A[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.@ In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record.  \n \nAccording to Directive & E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to \nestablish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive & E3.1.15, an \n\u201capplicant is responsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, \nextenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, \nand has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be Ain terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.@ See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG & 18:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \n\n \n \n \n \n \n5\nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nAG & 19 contains nine disqualifying conditions that could raise security concerns. \nOf these nine conditions, two conditions are applicable to the facts found in this case: \n \n(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and   \n \n(c)  a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \n \nFrom 2001 to 2009, Applicant accumulated nine delinquent debts, totaling \n$37,758 that remained unpaid or unresolved. These two disqualifying conditions apply.  \n \nAG \u00b6 20 contains six conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising from \nfinancial difficulties. Two mitigating conditions may be potentially applicable: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under \n \nsuch circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \n \nindividual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control; \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue; and, \n \n(f) the affluence resulted from a legal source of income. \n \nApplicant\u2019s failure to pay his delinquent debts is recent and continuous. His \nrepeated failure over the past three years, and in the extra time given him after the \nhearing, to resolve these debts demonstrates a lack of reliability, trustworthiness, and \ngood judgment by Applicant. AG \u00b6 20 (a) does not apply.  \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n6\nAG \u00b6 20 (b) does not apply because Applicant introduced no evidence to support \nthe conditions in this mitigating condition. \n \nThere is no evidence Applicant sought or received any financial counseling on \nhow to repay his delinquent debts. However, he undertook his repayment efforts on his \nown initiative. There are clear indications the problem is being resolved or is under \ncontrol. Therefore, AG \u00b6 20 (c) applies. \n \nApplicant worked since April 2010, to repay his creditors. He took multiple \nactions to resolve these debts voluntarily. Applicant resolved by payment or installment \npayment agreements about $20,000 of his debts. $19,093 of debt remains and \nApplicant is working on those two remaining debts now. Therefore, AG \u00b6 20 (d) applies. \n \nApplicant initially disputed one $251 debt. Recently, he withdrew the dispute and \npaid the debt. Therefore, AG \u00b6 20 (e) does not apply. \n \nAffluence from a legal source of income is not an issue. Therefore, AG \u00b6 20 (f) \ndoes not apply. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant=s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant=s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG & 2(a): \n \n (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual=s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \nUnder AG & 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.      \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant was an adult when he \nincurred the debts. He took action to resolve his delinquent debts. He is not vulnerable \nto pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress based on his current actions involving the \nresolution of seven delinquent debts. Applicant displayed a lack of good judgment \nincurring the debts but has now rectified the situation by making a concentrated effort to \n\n \n \n \n \n \n7\nresolve them as quickly as he can afford the payments. Resolving about $20,000 worth \nof debt in five months is good work. However, he should not have allowed the debts to \naccumulate to such an amount. He now understands the need to pay his debts in a \ntimely manner. There is little likelihood Applicant will repeat this type of conduct based \non his current experiences.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubt as to \nApplicant=s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant mitigated the security concerns arising under the guideline for \nFinancial Considerations. I conclude the \u201cwhole-person\u201d analysis for Applicant.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n          Subparagraphs 1.a to 1.i:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

The record evidence shows\nApplicant has a history of financial problems. He attributes the financial problems to his\nwife\u2019s unemployment beginning in about 2005 or 2006, when she lost her job as a nurse\ndue to her addiction to pain medication and related conduct, and she then turned to\nalcohol. His wife abused credit cards during this period and hid their financial problems\nfrom him. His wife has now been abstinent of both substances for several years.\nApplicant has made some progress in addressing his delinquent debts, but the progress\nis of recent vintage and he has substantial work to do. The record contains insufficient\nevidence to explain, extenuate, or mitigate the security concerns stemming from his\nproblematic credit history. Accordingly, as explained below, this case is decided against\nApplicant.\nMarch 30, 2010\n\n  This case is adjudicated under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry,\n1\nsigned by President Eisenhower on February 20, 1960, as amended, as well as DoD Directive 5220.6,\nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program, dated January 2, 1992, as amended\n(Directive). In addition, the revised Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified\nInformation (Revised Guidelines), effective within the Defense Department on September 1, 2006, apply to\nthis case. They replace the guidelines published in Enclosure 2 to the Directive. \n Hearing Exhibit I. \n2\n Tr. 67\u201368. \n3\n Tr. 65. \n4\n Exhibit 1. \n5\n2\nStatement of the Case\nActing under the relevant Executive Order and DoD Directive,  on June 25, 2009,\n1\nthe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (the Agency) issued a statement of\nreasons (SOR) explaining it was unable to find it is clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant Applicant access to classified information. The SOR is similar to a\ncomplaint, and it detailed the factual basis for the action under the security guideline\nknown as Guideline F for financial considerations. The SOR also recommended that the\ncase be submitted to an administrative judge to decide whether to deny or revoke\nApplicant\u2019s security clearance.  \nApplicant answered the SOR in a timely fashion and requested a decision without\na hearing. He also admitted the six debts alleged in the SOR and provided a short\nexplanation. In turn, Department Counsel timely requested a hearing.  The case was\n2\nassigned to me September 10, 2009. The hearing took place November 17, 2009. The\ntranscript (Tr.) was received December 7, 2009.    \nFindings of Fact\nBased on the record evidence as a whole, the following facts are established by\nsubstantial evidence.\nApplicant is a 45-year-old employee who is seeking an industrial security\nclearance for the first time. His employment history includes active duty military service\nin the U.S. Air Force during 1984\u20131995, when he held a security clearance. He is\ncurrently employed by a federal contractor as an instructor teaching at an explosive\nordnance disposal school. He estimated his 2008 gross income at $52,000, and he\nexpected to earn slightly less in 2009.  In addition, he receives military separation pay of\n3\nabout $4,600 annually.  \n4\nApplicant completed a security clearance application in October 2008.  In doing\n5\nso, he was required to give full, frank, and truthful answers to the various questions\nabout his background. In response to Question 27 about his financial record, Applicant\n\n Exhibits 2 and 3. \n6\n Exhibit A. \n7\n3\ndisclosed two foreclosure actions. The first foreclosure action was for $175,755 and had\nan estimated date of July 2006. The second foreclosure action (on a second mortgage)\nwas for $54,092 and had an estimated date of December 2006. In addition, in response\nto Question 28 about financial delinquencies, Applicant disclosed five credit card\naccounts that were then delinquent in the total amount of about $25,000. He also noted\nthat his wife had used cash advances to pay mortgage debt, and that he was in the\ninitial stages of pursuing a Chapter 13 bankruptcy case. \nHe traces his financial problems to 2005 or 2006, when his wife lost her job as a\nnurse due to her addiction to pain medication and related conduct. She turned to vodka\nafter losing access to pain medication. She was able to hide her alcoholism and the\nfinancial problems from Applicant. Specifically, she used credit card accounts to obtain\ncash advances. Applicant discovered the financial problems when he was served with a\nforeclosure action on a second mortgage in approximately December 2006. His wife\nthen informed him of a foreclosure action on the primary mortgage and it was then too\nlate to take any remedial action.\nWith his teenage daughter, Applicant moved out of the house as he concluded\nhe could no longer trust his wife. His intent was to pursue divorce. After the foreclosure\naction concluded, he decided to try to reconcile with his wife after concluding that he\nwas obliged to honor his marital vows. He and his wife are still married and their 18-\nyear-old daughter resides in their home as well. His wife has not worked outside the\nhome since losing her job as a nurse. \nThe SOR concerns six delinquent debts (the second mortgage, four credit card\naccounts, and a past-due auto loan) for a total of about $73,348. The six debts are\nestablished by Applicant\u2019s admissions and credit reports from 2008 and 2009.  The\n6\nstatus of the debts is discussed below.\nThe delinquent debt for $3,192 in SOR \u00b6 1.a stems from a credit card account.\nThe 2008 credit report shows it was 150 days past due; the 2009 credit report describes\nit as a charged-off account. A collection agency is now pursuing the debt and contacted\nApplicant by letter in November 2009.  Applicant entered into a repayment agreement\n7\nwith the creditor wherein he agreed to pay $150 monthly to resolve the debt. Other than\nthe demand letter, Applicant presented no paperwork on the debt.\nApplicant grouped the delinquent debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.c, and 1.d together\nbecause they are now with the same creditor. Two debts, for $9,957 and $2,011, stem\nfrom credit card accounts. The third debt for $39,740 stems from Applicant\u2019s second\nmortgage. Applicant testified that these three debts have been lumped into one account,\n\n Exhibit D. \n8\n Exhibit B. \n9\n Tr. 53. \n10\n Exhibit C. \n11\n Tr. 69. \n12\n4\nand he has made three $255 monthly payments on the account since August 2009.  But\n8\nthe account paperwork lists only the account number and creditor name for the second\nmortgage debt with a balance of $41,364 as of October 2009. The balance due is\nconsistent with the second mortgage debt, as opposed to the cumulative total of the\nthree debts, which is closer to $51,000. He presented no other paperwork on these\nthree debts.\nThe delinquent debt is SOR \u00b6 1.e for $17,509 stems from a credit card account.\nThe 2008 credit report describes it as a collection account with a balance of $14,858;\nthe 2009 credit report describes it as a collection account with a balance of $17,509. A\ncollection agency is now pursuing the debt and contacted Applicant by letter in October\n2009.  The demand letter noted a balance due of $21,936, but offered Applicant a\n9\nchance to settle the account for a lump-sum payment of $7,677. Applicant does not\nhave sufficient funds to accept the settlement offer, but he hopes to enter into a\nrepayment agreement with the creditor.  Other than the demand letter, Applicant\n10\npresented no paperwork on the debt.\nThe past-due debt in SOR \u00b6 1.f for $939 stems from an auto loan. The 2008\ncredit report describes it as 60 days past due in the amount of $712 with a balance of\n$1,841. The 2009 credit report describes it as 120 days past due in the amount of $939\nwith a balance of $853. Applicant testified that he paid off this auto loan, but he did not\npresent proof of payment or other paperwork on the debt.\nIn addition to the debts in the SOR, Applicant presented proof of payment on a\ncredit card account.  This account appears in both credit reports with a zero balance.\n11\nApplicant is currently living paycheck to paycheck without any money in the bank\nor cash accounts as a financial reserve.  Neither Applicant nor his wife has any active\n12\ncredit card accounts. Applicant has assumed responsibility for the household finances,\na chore his wife used to do, and he maintains strict control over the household\u2019s\nfinancial transactions. \nPolicies\nThis section sets forth the general principles of law and policies that apply to an\nindustrial security clearance case. To start, the only purpose of a clearance decision is\nto decide if an applicant is suitable for access to classified information.\n\n Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988) (\u201cit should be obvious that no one has a \u2018right\u2019 to\n13\na security clearance\u201d); Duane v. Department of Defense, 275 F.3d 988, 994 (10  Cir. 2002) (no right to a\nth\nsecurity clearance).\n 484 U.S. at 531.\n14\n Directive, \u00b6 3.2. \n15\n Directive, \u00b6 3.2. \n16\n ISCR Case No. 02-18663 (App. Bd. Mar. 23, 2004).\n17\n Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.14.\n18\n Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n19\n Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n20\n Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n21\n ISCR Case No. 01-20700 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002) (citations omitted).\n22\n5\nIt is well-established law that no one has a right to a security clearance.  As\n13\nnoted by the Supreme Court in the case of Department of Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe clearly\nconsistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they\nmust, on the side of denials.\u201d  Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive,\n14\nany doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified\ninformation will be resolved in favor of protecting national security.  \nA favorable clearance decision establishes eligibility of an applicant to be granted\na security clearance for access to confidential, secret, or top-secret information.  An\n15\nunfavorable decision (1) denies any application, (2) revokes any existing security\nclearance, and (3) prevents access to classified information at any level.  \n16\nThere is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for\naccess to classified information.  The government has the burden of presenting\n17\nevidence to establish facts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted.  An\n18\napplicant is responsible for presenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate\nfacts that have been admitted or proven.  In addition, an applicant has the ultimate\n19\nburden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.  In Egan, the Supreme\n20\nCourt stated that the burden of proof is less than a preponderance of the evidence.21\nThe Agency\u2019s appellate authority has followed the Court\u2019s reasoning, and a judge\u2019s\nfindings of fact are reviewed under the substantial-evidence standard.22\nThe Revised Guidelines set forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when\nevaluating a person\u2019s security clearance eligibility, including disqualifying conditions\n(DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) for each guideline. In addition, each clearance\ndecision must be a commonsense decision based upon consideration of all the relevant\n\n Executive Order 10865, \u00a7 7.\n23\n Revised Guidelines, \u00b6\u00b6 18, 19, and 20 (setting forth the security concern and the disqualifying and mitigating\n24\nconditions). \n Revised Guidelines, \u00b6 18.  \n25\n Revised Guidelines, \u00b6 19(a).  \n26\n Revised Guidelines, \u00b6 19(c). \n27\n6\nand material information, the pertinent criteria and adjudication factors, and the whole-\nperson concept. \nA person granted access to classified information enters into a special\nrelationship with the government. The government must be able to have a high degree\nof trust and confidence in those persons to whom it grants access to classified\ninformation. The decision to deny a person a security clearance is not a determination\nof an applicant\u2019s loyalty.  Instead, it is a determination that an applicant has not met the\n23\nstrict guidelines the President has established for granting eligibility for access.\nAnalysis\nUnder Guideline F for financial considerations,  the suitability of an applicant\n24\nmay be questioned or put into doubt when that applicant has a history of excessive\nindebtedness, financial problems or difficulties, or financial irresponsibility. A security\nconcern typically exists due to significant unpaid debts. The overall concern under\nGuideline F is that: \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to\nprotect classified information.  \n25\nSimilarly, an individual who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible,\nunconcerned, negligent, or careless in properly handling and safeguarding classified\ninformation.   \nThe record here supports a conclusion that Applicant has a history of financial\nproblems or difficulties as shown by the more than $70,000 in delinquent debt that he is\nnow facing. This history raises concerns because it indicates inability or unwillingness to\nsatisfy debts  and a history of not meeting financial obligations  within the meaning of\n26\n27\nGuideline F. The facts are more than sufficient to establish these two disqualifying\nconditions, and they suggest financial irresponsibility as well.  \n\n Revised Guidelines, \u00b6 20 (a) \u2013 (f) (setting forth six mitigating conditions). \n28\n7\nUnder \u00b6 20 of Guideline F, there are six conditions that may mitigate security\nconcerns.  The six conditions are as follows: \n28\n(a) The behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred\nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast\ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment;\n(b) The conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely\nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business\ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or\nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;\n(c) The person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is\nunder control;\n(d) The individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or\notherwise resolve debts;\n(e) The individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the\npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides\ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides\nevidence of actions to resolve the issue; and \n(f) The affluence resulted from a legal source of income.\nThe record supports a conclusion that both \u00b6\u00b6 20(b) and 20(d) apply in\nmitigation. It is apparent that Applicant\u2019s financial problems stem from quite difficult and\nunexpected circumstances largely beyond his control when his wife experienced her\nproblems in the 2005\u20132006 period. This is not a case where an applicant is engaging in\nhigh living or otherwise spending beyond his means. And Applicant also receives limited\ncredit for his efforts to address his financial problems as described above in the findings\nof fact.\nAlthough he presented evidence in mitigation, the credit in mitigation is\ninsufficient to overcome the security concerns. His financial problems started in about\n2006 with the foreclosure actions, which was about three years ago. Since then, he has\nmade little progress in resolving his financial problems. Indeed, the two repayment\nagreements began recently in August and November 2009, which suggests Applicant\ntook the action in light of this proceeding. \nLooking forward, based on the more than $70,000 in delinquent debt that\nApplicant is facing and his limited means to address it, it is too soon to rule out the\n\n Revised Guidelines, \u00b6 2(a)(1) \u2013 (9).\n29\n8\nlikelihood of additional financial problems. What is missing here is a realistic plan (based\non his ability to pay) along with a well-established track record of adhering to the plan.\nAlthough Applicant has good intentions and wants to repay his creditors, his track\nrecord of repayment at this point is too skimpy to make any safe predictive judgments\nabout the future.   \nTo conclude, the facts and circumstances surrounding Applicant\u2019s ongoing\nfinancial problems justify current doubts about his judgment, reliability, and\ntrustworthiness. He did not present sufficient evidence to explain, extenuate, or mitigate\nhis history of financial problems and the concomitant security concerns. In reaching this\nconclusion, I gave due consideration to the whole-person concept  and Applicant\u2019s\n29\nfavorable evidence. Applicant did not meet his ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a\nfavorable clearance decision. This case is decided against Applicant. \nFormal Findings\nThe formal findings on the SOR allegations are as follows:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.a\u20131.f: \nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of the record as a whole, it is not clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to\nclassified information is denied.        \nMichael H. Leonard\nAdministrative Judge \n",

Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn November 9, 2010, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) \nissued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under \nGuideline F. DOHA acted under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense \nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) \nimplemented by the Department of Defense on September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on November 24, 2010, and requested a hearing. \nThe case was assigned to me on June 6, 2011. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on \nJune 21, 2011, and the hearing was convened as scheduled on July 13, 2010. The \nGovernment offered exhibits (GE) 1 through 7, which were admitted into evidence \nAugust 22, 2011\n\n \n2 \n \nwithout objection. Applicant testified, called one witness, and submitted exhibits (AE) A \nthrough G, which were admitted into evidence without objection. DOHA received the \nhearing transcript (Tr.) on July 20, 2011.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is a 27-year-old security officer who works for a defense contractor. \nShe has worked for her current employer for about three years. She graduated from \nhigh school in June 2001 and attended two years of college. She is married and has \none child who is four years old. This is the first time that she has applied for a security \nclearance.1  \n \n \nThe SOR alleges 27 delinquent debts totaling about $41,532. The debts were \nlisted on credit reports obtained on May 1, 2009; October 19, 2010; and May 26, 2010. \nIn her answer, Applicant admitted each of the alleged debts. Her admissions are \nincorporated herein as findings of fact.2 \n \n \nTwenty-one of the alleged debts are medical debts totaling $31,524. The \nremaining debts include two student loans totaling $6,478 and four consumer debts \ntotaling $3,530. Applicant primarily attributes her financial difficulties to medical \nproblems that arose while she was pregnant in 2007. Due to her medical problems, she \nwas placed in an unpaid leave status at work from January 2007 to July 2008. Initially, \nshe did not have medical insurance to cover her medical expenses. During her \npregnancy, she met with a social worker, applied for, and obtained Medicaid coverage \nfor a period of time. Medicaid covered certain pre-delivery and delivery medical bills and \na gallbladder operation. SOR \u00b6 1.d is a $12,855 medical debt that arose from an eight-\nday period of hospitalization. She incurred that debt before she applied for Medicaid. \nShe also testified that Medicaid covered none of the alleged medical debts and \nacknowledged she was financially responsible for them. She indicated that she was \nunaware of most of the medical debts until she applied for her security clearance. One \nof the consumer debts resulted from Applicant buying an item for her father with the \nunderstanding that he would make the installment payments, but he failed to do so.3 \n \n \nIn the SOR, there are two sets of duplicate debts. First, the debt alleged in SOR \n\u00b6 1.b (medical account # 2939400 in the amount of $481) is a duplicate of the debt in \nSOR \u00b6 1.p (medical account # 2939400 in the amount $691). Second, the debt alleged \nin SOR \u00b6 1.f (medical account #1083102172 in the amount $2,207) is a duplicate of the \ndebt in SOR \u00b6 1.q (medical account #1083102172 in the amount $2,867).4  \n \n                                                          \n1 Tr. at 29-31; GE 1. \n \n2 GE 1-7. \n \n3 Tr. at 33-38, 45, 48-59, 68-70; GE 3. Applicant\u2019s child was born in August 2007. See AE G. \n \n4 Tr. at 42-45; SOR.  \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \nAfter returning to work, Applicant paid SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.o and 1.aa, the two student \nloans. In about June 2009, she established a debt management program (DMP) with a \nfinancial management agency. The alleged debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b/1.p (medical debt \n$691), 1.f/1.q (medical debt of $2,867), 1.n (collection account of $1,111), 1.y (collection \naccount of $1,249), and 1.z (collection account of $677) are included in the DMP. Under \nthe DMP, Applicant makes monthly payments of $222 to the financial management \nagency that, in turn, disburses that money to creditors registered in that program. One \ndebt not listed in that SOR is included the DMP. The terms of the DMP provide that \nApplicant remains solely responsibility for the payment of unregistered debts.5 \n \n \nIn attempting to resolve her debts, Applicant obtained financial counseling from \nher bank and the financial management agency. At the hearing, she was honest and \nforthcoming about her delinquent debts and has accepted responsibility for them. She \nintends to pay off her remaining delinquent debts. Once she pays the debts listed in the \nDMP, she will add more delinquent debts to that program. She estimated the delinquent \ndebts will be resolved within five years.6 \n \n \nApplicant is meeting all of her current financial obligations. Her monthly income is \nabout $1,500 and her monthly expenses are about $1,387, including the DMP payment. \nHer husband was unemployed for about a year, but recently started working again. \nWhile unemployed, he collected unemployment compensation that he used towards \npaying their rent. The amount of his current monthly income is unknown. She and her \nhusband have about $3,600 in savings. At the time of the hearing, her child was \ncovered by health insurance, but she and her husband still were not covered. They do \nnot qualify currently for Medicaid and her company\u2019s health insurance program is too \nexpensive. Her husband will become eligible for health insurance with his company in \nabout three months, and she expects to be covered by his insurance.7 \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s second-level supervisor, who served 27 years in law enforcement \npositions, testified that Applicant is extremely dependable. He indicated that, as a \ngeneral rule, employees who lose their security clearances are removed from the \nworksite immediately. However, \u201c[s]enior management [of the defense contractor] \ndetermined that [Applicant] has done such a quality job and that her work performance \nis above reproach that they have allowed her to remain on site. . . which speaks \nvolumes. . . .\u201d He knew of no other employee in that situation who was allowed to \nremain on site. He stated that \u201call employees should be like her and I don\u2019t say that \nlightly.\u201d8 \n \n                                                          \n5 Tr. at 33-38, 59-61, 68-69, 71-76; GE 2, 7; AE F. \n \n6 Tr. at 38, 42, 59-60, 74-76, 82. \n \n7 Tr. at 38-40, 61-67; AE D, E. Applicant\u2019s income tax refunds were withheld to repay, at least in \npart, her student loans. See GE 3. \n \n8 Tr. at 38-40. \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \nA plant protection manager described Applicant\u2019s work ethic and performance as \n\u201cno less than exceptional.\u201d The manager also indicated she is a hard-working security \nofficer who takes her work very seriously. He considers her a great asset to the \ncompany.9 \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions that are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable decision.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \n                                                          \n9 Tr. at 36-38; AE A, B, C. \n \n\n \n5 \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern for Financial Considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18 as \nfollows:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. Two are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n \n(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and \n \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \n \nApplicant accumulated a number of delinquent debts that she was unable or \nunwilling to satisfy for a period of years. This evidence is sufficient to raise the above \ndisqualifying conditions. \n \n  \nSeveral Financial Considerations mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are \npotentially applicable:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control;  \n\n \n6 \n \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of \nactions to resolve the issue. \n \nAs a result of medical complications arising from a pregnancy, Applicant was \nplaced in an unpaid leave status by her employer from January 2007 to July 2008. She \ndid not have medical insurance to cover a number of medical expenses incurred during \nthat pregnancy, including an eight-day period of hospitalization. She eventually obtained \nMedicaid coverage that paid for various medical expenses for a period of time. Her \nhusband was also recently unemployed for about a year. Appellant\u2019s medical problems, \nher period of unpaid leave, and her husband\u2019s period of unemployment were conditions \nbeyond her control that severely impacted her financial situation. She returned to work \nin July 2008. Since then, she obtained financial counseling and paid her two student \nloans totaling $6,478. In about June 2009, she established a DMP and pays $222 per \nmonth into that program. Six delinquent debts, including four of the five consumer debts, \nare being addressed in the DMP. Given her current financial situation, she is applying a \nreasonable amount of her income towards the delinquent debts. She intends to satisfy \nall of her delinquent debts. Once she satisfies the debts registered in the DMP, she will \nadd other delinquent debts to that program. Currently, she is meeting her current \nfinancial obligations and expects to obtain medical insurance coverage soon. Her \nfinancial problems are being resolved in a prudent manner and are unlikely to recur. \nShe has acted responsibly in addressing her financial difficulties. I find that AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(b) \nand 20(c) apply and AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a) and 20(d) partially apply.  \n \n \nA review of the SOR revealed that two sets of the alleged debts are duplicates. \nSpecifically, SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.p are duplicates as are 1.f and 1.q. Even though \nApplicant admitted each of the alleged debts, I find that she has a legitimate basis for \ndisputing SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.f and that AG \u00b6 20(e) applies to those two duplicate \nallegations. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \n\n \n7 \n \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nrelevant facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 \n2(a) were addressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s service to her employer has been exceptional. As a general rule, her \nemployer immediately removes employees who lose their security clearances from the \nworksite. Because of her dependability, work ethic, and performance, Applicant\u2019s \nemployer has made an exception for her. After her interim security clearance was \nwithdrawn, her employer placed her in a security officer position in which she did not \nneed a security clearance. This action highlights the level of trust and confidence her \nemployer has in her.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with no questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has mitigated the Financial Considerations security concerns.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by section \nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.aa:  \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nJames F. Duffy \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Applicant\u2019s current\nfinancial problems arose prior to these periods of unemployment. According to his own\nadmission, he accumulated debt while in the military (Tr. 15), used credit cards to pay\nfor travel home to see his parents, and incurred other credit card debt in 2004 for an\nengagement ring (Tr. 44).  \nIn July 2008, Applicant moved in with his girlfriend, who is the mother of his\nyoung son. They purchased a house in her name for $189,000, but Applicant agreed to\npay the monthly mortgage of approximately $1,400 (Tr. 22). \nThe SOR alleges seven delinquent debts, including a 2006 vehicle repossession.\nThe approximate total of Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts is $27,000, as listed on his credit\nreport (GE 3). The current status of Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts is described below.\nThe debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a for $123 is a medical creditor. This account is\nunpaid.\nThe debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b for $1,833 is a jewelry store account that is\ncharged-off. The account is unpaid. \nThe debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.c for $2,969, is a collection account. This account is\nunpaid.\nThe debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.d for $2,543 is a credit card account that is charged-\noff. This account is unpaid.\n\n3\nThe debt alleged in SOR 1.e for $1,675 is a collection account for $1,675.\nApplicant received an offer of settlement in the mail for the account (Tr. 70). He settled\nthe account for $50 in November 2009, and he provided documentation to support his\nclaim (AE B).\nThe debt alleged in SOR 1.f for $2,522 is an account that is charged-off. This\naccount is unpaid. Applicant claimed this could be a duplicate account with SOR 1.c\nbecause he only had one account with the alleged creditor. He did not provide any\ndocumentation to support his assertion.\nThe debt alleged in SOR 1.g for $15,425 is the result of an involuntary vehicle\nrepossession that occurred in 2006. The vehicle was auctioned, but Applicant has not\ncontacted the creditor to ascertain the amount he owes.\nApplicant\u2019s net monthly income is approximately $1,650, as a result of\nunemployment benefits. His girlfriend, who is a social worker, has a net monthly income\nof $2,400. After daily living expenses and car payments, the net remainder is about\n$320. Applicant has no budget. He did not receive financial counseling. He plans to pay\nhis delinquent debts when he obtains another job (Tr. 103). He promised to pay some\nsmaller accounts when he receives a tax refund this year.\nApplicant\u2019s site supervisor recommends Applicant due to his dedication and duty\nto service. He considers him \u201cone of the best security officers\u201d he has worked with in the\npast years (AE A).\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required in\nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2,\nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the\n\u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable\ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a\ndecision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\n\n4\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship\ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government\nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk\nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified\ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation\nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order (EO) 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin\nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty\nof the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple\nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set\nout in AG & 18:      \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nAG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.\nSimilarly under AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise\nsecurity concerns. Applicant accumulated delinquent debts on various accounts for a\nperiod of time. His credit reports confirm the debts. He has been unable to pay his\nobligations. The evidence is sufficient to raise these disqualifying conditions.\n\n5\nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security\nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG \u00b6 20(a), the disqualifying condition\nmay be mitigated where Athe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or\noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt\non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ Applicant has\nexperienced financial difficulties since 2003. His debts are the result of overspending,\nnot unusual circumstances. Because they are ongoing, they are recent. This mitigating\ncondition does not apply. \nUnder AG & 20(b), it may be mitigating where Athe conditions that resulted in the\nfinancial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a\nbusiness downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation),\nand the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.@ While Applicant did have\nperiods of unemployment and is currently unemployed, his problems arose prior to that\ntime. He lacked sufficient income to pay his debts. Applicant was employed until\nOctober 2009, but he did not resolve the delinquent accounts. He settled one account\nrecently (SOR 1.e). When he was employed with the defense contractor, he did not act\nresponsibly to pay accounts or arrange for payment plans. This mitigating condition\ndoes not apply.\nEvidence that Athe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control@\nis potentially mitigating under AG & 20(c). Similarly, AG & 20(d) applies where the\nevidence shows Athe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or\notherwise resolve debts.@ Applicant has not received financial counseling. He is not\nactively working on resolving the financial issues. I conclude these mitigating conditions\ndo not apply.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\n\n6\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case and conclude they are insufficient to\novercome the government\u2019s case. Applicant served in the U.S. Marine Corps for four\nyears. He has provided help to his mother for many years. He has worked hard but has\nnot had any financial stability. He has not established a meaningful track record of debt\npayment. Applicant presented insufficient information to show that he is taking\nreasonable and responsible action to resolve his financial issues. Applicant\u2019s\nmanagement of his finances and past obligations do not indicate he will be concerned,\nresponsible, and careful regarding classified information. Applicant has not mitigated\nsecurity concerns based on his finances. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I\nconclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns arising under financial\nconsiderations. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a: through 1.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:-1.g:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n                                              \n_________________\nNOREEN A. LYNCH\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Goldstein, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro se\nApril 30, 2010\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nMOGUL, Martin H., Administrative Judge:\nOn September 2, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under Guideline F\nfor Applicant. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines\n(AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the\nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nOn September 15, 2009, Applicant replied to the SOR (RSOR) in writing, and\nshe requested a hearing before an Administrative Judge. The case was assigned to this\nAdministrative Judge on October 5, 2009. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on October\n23, 2009, and I convened the hearing as scheduled on December 8, 2009, in Las\nVegas, Nevada. The Government offered Exhibits 1 through 8, which were received\nwithout objection. Applicant testified on her own behalf and submitted Exhibits A\nthrough F at the time of hearing, which were also admitted without objection. I granted\nApplicant\u2019s request to keep the record open until December 22, 2009, to submit\n\n2\nadditional documents. She timely submitted three additional documents, which have\nbeen identified and entered into evidence collectively as Exhibit G. DOHA received the\ntranscript of the hearing (Tr) on December 23, 2009. Based upon a review of the case\nfile, pleadings, exhibits, and the testimony of Applicant, eligibility for access to classified\ninformation is granted.\nFindings of Fact\nIn her RSOR, Applicant admitted and denied, in part, SOR allegations 1.a. and\n1.b.  After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, including\nApplicant's RSOR, the admitted documents, and the testimony of Applicant, and upon\ndue consideration of that evidence, I make the following findings of fact: \nApplicant is 44 years old. She is unmarried and has no children. Applicant is\nemployed by a defense contractor, and she seeks a DoD security clearance in\nconnection with her employment in the defense sector.\nThe SOR lists 2 allegations (1.a. and 1.b.) regarding financial difficulties under\nAdjudicative Guideline F.  Both allegations will be discussed below in the same order as\nthey were listed on the SOR:\n1.a. This overdue debt is cited in the SOR in the amount of $20,817.  In her\nRSOR, Applicant admitted that there is a debt to the creditor listed on the SOR, but she\ndid not agree that the amount stated on the SOR was correct. At the hearing, Applicant\ntestified that she believed that amount owed on this debt for vehicle that was\nrepossessed was less than $5,000. She conceded that the creditor stated that the\namount owed is $12,590.69 (Exhibit E), but that her attorney is still arguing with the\ncreditor over the amount that is actually owed. (Tr at 30.)\nApplicant testified that she had purchased a vehicle at the time when she had a\nfull-time job that was paying her $85,000 a year. However, after she learned that her\nmother had cancer, she resigned from her job so that she could be a full-time caregiver\nfor her mother. She sold her condominium and lived off of the proceeds of that sale. (Tr\nat 31-35.) She was unemployed for a period from August 2001 until April 2002.\nThereafter, when she went back to work, her income was significantly reduced (Tr at\n77-78.) (Exhibit B.)\nApplicant went on to explain that after communicating with the company that\ngave her the auto loan that she was having problems with the payments, a\nrepresentative of the company sent her an alternative payment plan. After making\npayments for nine months according to this new schedule, she was contacted by this\ncompany and she was told that the representative, who made the offer, was not\nauthorized to do so. She continued making payments while attempting to contact the\ncompany. After being late for two weeks in making one payment, the company\nrepossessed her vehicle.  She was told she would have to pay them $5,000, and then\nshe could begin making regular payments again. At that point she informed them that\nthey could keep the vehicle, and she would just pay whatever it took to resolve the debt.\n\n3\nShe testified that the creditor never told her an amount to pay, despite her asking over a\ntwo year period what it would take to resolve the debt. (Tr at 37-42.)\n1.b. This overdue debt is cited in the SOR in the amount of $2,014. Applicant\ntestified that this debt was incurred from an apartment complex in which she lived from\nSeptember 2005, through December 2006. When she took in her niece, it was\nnecessary for her to move to a larger apartment. She told the manager of her apartment\nthat she needed a larger apartment, and since there was none available in that building,\nshe planned to move out. The manager told her it would be necessary to pay $632 for\ncarpet damage, but she would not have to pay the two months remaining on her lease.\nAfter she moved out, she received a bill both for the carpet and the rental amount owed,\nwhich Applicant has disputed. (Tr at 42-46.)\nApplicant testified that in October 2007, she engaged the services of an attorney\nto dispute and try to resolve these two debts. She testified that her attorney has also\nhad a great deal of difficulty getting these two creditors to respond to him to try to\nresolve these debts. Exhibit E contains the last correspondence received from the\ncreditor to Applicant\u2019s attorney, regarding the debt listed as 1.a., above, which was on\nSeptember 16, 2009. The attorney sent a follow up letter on September 25, 2009, but\naccording to Applicant no further letter from the creditor was ever received. The attorney\nsent a letter to the creditor from 1.b. on November 5, 2007, (Exhibit 3 at 173), but has\nnever received a response from that creditor. Applicant testified that after she turned\nthese two debts over to her attorney, she has left it to him, and made no efforts herself\nto contact these creditors.  (Tr at 47-48.) Applicant has filed a notice with the credit\nreporting agencies, disputing each of these two debts. (Tr at 86-87.)\nOn cross examination, Applicant conceded that she has had problems with other\napartments, because after she has moved out she has been told there was an amount\nstill owing, although when she has moved out she always believed that she had paid\nwhat was owed.  When she became aware that there was still an outstanding balance,\nshe has always paid off these other debts as soon as possible. (Tr at 58-59.)\nMitigation\nApplicant testified that she is not overdue on any of her other debts. She\npurchased another vehicle for $17,000, and she is current on the monthly payments of\n$478 on that vehicle. She has not been late in paying her credit cards. (Tr at 50-51.)\nShe purchased a home in September 2008, and has made the payments of $2,300 a\nmonth, since that time. She has not been late on any house payments. (Tr at 78-79.) \nApplicant prepared a Personal Financial Statement (Exhibit 3 at 162), which\nshows that she has a net monthly remainder of approximately $380. She testified  that\nshe could make payments on these two debts, but she testified credibly that she wants\nto make sure they will be resolved before she starts making payment to these creditors.\n(Tr at 74.)\n\n4\nApplicant\u2019s attorney submitted a letter on behalf of Applicant. (Exhibit G.) He\nconfirmed that he has been engaged by Applicant to contest these two debts. He stated\nthat Applicant \u201cbelieves with good cause that the amounts claimed as owing and placed\nin collections and appearing on her credit report are debts that are not actually owed by\nher or are not properly accounted for.\u201d It is his plan to continue negotiating to attempt to\nsatisfactorily resolve these debts.  \nFinally, Applicant submitted two positive character letters in Exhibit G, from\nindividuals who know her in her current employment. She was described by a retired\nUnited States Air Force Colonel as someone who is \u201cresponsible and trustworthy. I\nwould have absolutely no reservations in recommending her for a position of trust.\u201d  The\nFacility Security Officer of her current employer wrote that Applicant \u201chas unquestioned\nloyalty, integrity, trustworthiness and reliability.\u201d\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\n\n5\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set\nout in AG \u00b6 18:  \n      Failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns and\ncould potentially apply in this case.  Under AG \u00b6 19 (a), \u201can inability or unwillingness to\nsatisfy debts\u201d is potentially disqualifying. Similarly under AG \u00b6 19 (c), \u201ca history of not\nmeeting financial obligations\u201d may raise security concerns. I find that both of these\ndisqualifying conditions apply to Applicant in this case. The evidence has established\nthat Applicant accumulated two significant delinquent debts. \nAG \u00b6 20 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns from financial\ndifficulties: Under AG \u00b6  20 (b), \u201cit may be mitigating where the conditions that resulted\nin the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of\nemployment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce\nor separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.\u201d As noted\nabove, Applicant testified that her financial problems resulted in part from the period\nwhen she was unemployed due to the illness of her mother, and her reduced income\nthereafter. Since then the only two debts that remain unresolved appear to be because\nof legitimate and good-faith disputes that Applicant has with the creditors. By engaging\nthe service of an attorney to help resolve these debts, after she could not do it by\nherself, I find that Applicant has acted responsibly. Therefore, I find that this mitigating\ncondition is a factor for consideration in this case. \n\n6\nApplicant is current on all of her debts with the exception of two that she is\ndisputing. Therefore, I conclude that Applicant has mitigated the financial concerns of\nthe Government.\nWhole-Person Concept\nUnder the whole-person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nUnder AG \u00b6 2 (c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a\nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.      \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Based on all of the reasons cited\nabove as to why the Mitigating Condition applies, together with the very strong\nrecommendations on her behalf, I find that the record evidence leaves me with no\nsignificant questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security\nclearance under the whole-person concept. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant\nhas  mitigated the security concerns. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a. and 1.b.:\nFor Applicant\n\n7\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.\n                                              \nMartin H. Mogul\nAdministrative Judge\n",

He is employed by a defense contractor as an Engineer and is applying for a security clearance in connection with his employment. Paragraph 1 (Guideline H - Drug Involvement). The Government alleges that the Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he abuses illegal drugs. The Applicant admitted allegations 1(a), 1(b), 1(c) and 1(e), and denies allegation 1(d) of the SOR set forth under this guideline. (Applicant\u2019s Answer to SOR.) The Applicant used marijuana in total about 100 times and cocaine at least once, between the period from 1996 to June 2009. He started using marijuana at the young age of thirteen, and used it four or five times through high school. (Tr. p. 40.) Beginning in his second year of college, he started using marijuana on a weekly basis. He continued to use it weekly until about 2005. In 2007, he graduated from college, and has used it less than ten times since then. (Tr. p. 41.) He states that he used marijuana once in February 2008, and once in July 2008, while on trips to Canada, where he also purchased it. He used marijuana most recently about five times in June 2009, while on vacation in the Bahamas, where he also purchased it. (Tr. pp. 42-43 and 86.)

Testan, Attorney At Law\nJune 21, 2010\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nLOKEY ANDERSON, Darlene D., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted his Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing\n(e-QIP) on July 3, 2008.  (Government Exhibit 1.)  On October 23, 2009, the Defense\nOffice of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing\nthe security concerns under Guidelines H, E and B for Applicant.  The action was taken\nunder Executive Order 10865, \u201cSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry\u201d\n(February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, \u201cDefense\nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\u201d Program (January 2, 1992), as\namended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President\non December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense (DoD) for SORs\nissued after September 1, 2006. \n \nThe Applicant responded to the SOR on November 9, 2009, wherein he\nrequested a hearing before a DOHA Administrative Judge.  This case was assigned to\nthe  Administrative Judge on December 8, 2009.  A notice of hearing was issued on\nJanuary 8, 2010, scheduling the hearing for March 9, 2010.  At the hearing the\nGovernment presented three exhibits, referred to as Government Exhibits 1 to 3, which\nwere admitted without objection.  The Applicant presented two exhibits, referred to as\nApplicant\u2019s Exhibits A and B, and called two witnesses.  He also testified on his own\n\n2\nbehalf.  The official transcript (Tr.) was received on March 22, 2010.  Based upon a\nreview of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to\nclassified information is denied.\nREQUEST FOR ADMINISTRATIVE NOTICE\nApplicant\u2019s Counsel requested that I take administrative notice of certain facts\nconcerning the current political condition in Colombia that were set forth in\nAdministrative Notice document 1, particularly page 7, paragraphs 3 and 4.  Department\nCounsel had no objection.  The document was not admitted into evidence but was\nincluded in the record.  The facts administratively noticed are set out in the Findings of\nFact, below. \nFINDINGS OF FACT\nThe Applicant is 26 years old and has a Bachelors Degree in Aerospace\nEngineering.  He is employed by a defense contractor as an Engineer and is applying\nfor a security clearance in connection with his employment.  \nParagraph 1 (Guideline H - Drug Involvement). The Government alleges that the\nApplicant is ineligible for clearance because he abuses illegal drugs.\nThe Applicant admitted allegations 1(a), 1(b), 1(c) and 1(e), and denies allegation\n1(d) of the SOR set forth under this guideline.  (Applicant\u2019s Answer to SOR.)  The\nApplicant used marijuana in total about 100 times and cocaine at least once, between\nthe period from 1996 to June 2009.  \nHe started using marijuana at the young age of thirteen, and used it four or five\ntimes through high school.  (Tr. p. 40.)  Beginning in his second year of college, he\nstarted using marijuana on a weekly basis.  He continued to use it weekly until about\n2005.  In 2007, he graduated from college, and has used it less than ten times since\nthen.  (Tr. p. 41.)  He states that he used marijuana once in February 2008, and once in\nJuly 2008, while on trips to Canada, where he also purchased it.  He used marijuana\nmost recently about five times in June 2009, while on vacation in the Bahamas, where\nhe also purchased it.  (Tr. pp. 42-43 and 86.)  \nIn June 2008, the Applicant started working for his current employer.  He\ncompleted a security clearance application in July 2008.  During an interview with the\nDefense Department in August 2008, the Applicant indicated to the investigator that he\nmay use marijuana in the future.  (Tr. p. 45.)  Applicant testified that he Applicant knew\nthat his use of marijuana is illegal, against company policy and against DoD regulation.\n(Tr. pp. 75-82 and 87.)  Despite this, he made the choice to use marijuana again in June\n2009.  (Tr. p. 86.)  Applicant stated that when he received the interrogatories from the\nDoD, and after speaking to a co-worker about his marijuana use, he decided to stop\nusing marijuana altogether.  (Tr. p. 43.)  Applicant presented an undated statement\n\n3\nwherein he promises not to use marijuana or any other illegal drug ever again with the\nunderstanding that if he violates his promise, his security clearance would be\nautomatically revoked.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit B.)\n     \nThe Applicant used cocaine on one occasion in March 2007, while on vacation in\nMexico.  The Applicant explained that he was at a bar when some locals offered him a\ncocaine taste.  He took the taste, not wanting to offend the locals and put a dab on his\nlips and gums, and they became numb.  (Tr. p. 53.)  He was then asked if he wanted to\npurchase it, and he declined. \nParagraph 2 (Guideline E - Personal Conduct).  The Government alleges that the\nApplicant is ineligible for clearance because he has engaged in conduct involving\nquestionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or an unwillingness to comply with\nrules and regulations.  \nThe Applicant admits allegation 2(a) and denies allegation 2(b) of the SOR set\nforth under this guideline.  (Applicant\u2019s Answer to SOR.)  The Applicant completed a\nsecurity clearance application dated July 3, 2008.  Question 24(a) asked him if since the\nage of 16 or in the last 7 years, whichever is shorter, had he illegally used any\ncontrolled substance.  The Applicant responded, \u201cYes,\u201d and listed marijuana, and the\ndates of September 2003 and February 2008.  The Applicant explained that his more\nfrequent use of marijuana started in September 2003, and his last date of use occurred\nin February 2008.  \nApplicant further explained that he did not list cocaine on his security clearance\napplication because he does not believe he has used it as described above.  (Tr. p. 55).\nHe does not believe that he was under the influence of the drug and therefore was not\ndeliberately lying in response to the question by not listing it. \nParagraph 3 (Guideline B - Foreign Influence).  The Government alleges in this\nparagraph that the Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he has foreign contacts\nthat could create the potential for foreign influence that could result in the compromise\nof classified information.\nThe Applicant admits the allegation of the SOR set forth under this guideline.\n(Applicant\u2019s Answer to SOR.)  The Applicant was born in Colombia and has lived in the\nUnited States since he was six years old.  All of his immediate family members from\nColombia, have moved to the United States and have become United States citizens.\nHe has an aunt and a cousin (his mother\u2019s sister and her daughter), who are citizens of\nColombia and currently reside with the Applicant in his parents home.  They were\nsponsored by the Applicant\u2019s mother in 1998, and both currently have a green card.  His\naunt is a nanny, and his cousin is a full time student.  They have lived in the Applicant\u2019s\nmother\u2019s home for the past ten years.  They petitioned for permanent residency in 2001,\nand intend to become American citizens.  Neither of them have any affiliation with the\nColombian government.  The Applicant provides no financial support to either foreign\nrelative and feels no sense of obligation to them.  Applicant also has relatives in\n\n4\nColombia on both his mother and father\u2019s side of the family, but has no contact with\nthem what so ever.    \nI have taken official notice of the following facts concerning Colombia.  Colombia\nis the third-most populous country in Latin America, after Brazil and Mexico.  In 1822,\nthe United States became one of the first countries to recognize the new republic and to\nestablish a resident diplomatic mission.  Over the years, the United States and\nColombia have signed many important agreements addressing the issues of\nenvironment, civil aviation, chemical control, and maritime ship boarding to allow for\nsearch of suspected drug running vessel.  Since 2007, nearly $570 million have been\ninvested only in socio-economic and humanitarian assistance to Colombia.  In\nNovember 2009, a new multi-year Country Assistance Agreement with the Government\nof Colombia was signed with first year funding of nearly $212 million.  The agreement\nbrings continuity to the socio-economic and humanitarian assistance that the United\nStates Government implements in the country.  The United States has continued close\ncooperation with Colombia concerning terrorism and the illicit narcotics trade.  The\nUnited States policy toward Colombia supports the Colombian Government\u2019s efforts to\nstrengthen its democratic institutions, promote respect for human rights and the rule of\nlaw, foster socio-economic development, address immediate humanitarian need, and\nend the threats to democracy posed by narcotics trafficking and terrorism.  Promoting\nsecurity, stability, and prosperity in Colombia will continue as long term American\ninterests in the region.         \n   \nTwo witnesses testified on behalf of the Applicant.  His girlfriend, who has known\nhim for two years, and who does not use any illegal drugs, testified that she believes the\nApplicant to be reliable, trustworthy, and a man of his word.  She does not believe that\nhe will ever use any illegal drug again.  (Tr. pp. 22-24.) \nThe Applicant\u2019s uncle, who has known the Applicant for the past twenty years\ntestified that the Applicant is honest, trustworthy and a man of his word.  He believes he\nwill follow through with his commitment to refrain from illegal drug use.  (Tr. pp. 27-30). \nTwelve letters of recommendation from the Applicant\u2019s supervisor, coworkers,\nprofessional associates and friends, who have had daily contact with the Applicant at\nwork, consider him to be honest, reliable and trustworthy.  He is said to be bright,\narticulate and eager to learn and perform.  He has always exercised good judgment and\nis highly recommended for a position of trust.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit A.)  \nPOLICIES\nEnclosure 2 and Section E.2.2. of the Directive sets forth adjudication policies\ndivided into \"Disqualifying Factors\" and \"Mitigating Factors.\"  The following Disqualifying\nFactors and Mitigating Factors are found to be applicable in this case:\n\n5\nGuideline H (Drug Involvement)\nThe Concern. Use of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because it may impair\njudgment and because it raises questions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to\ncomply with laws, rules, and regulations.\nConditions that could raise a security concern:\n25.(a) any drug abuse;\n25.(c) illegal drug possession, including cultivation, processing, manufacture,\npurchase, sale or distribution; or possession of drug paraphernalia.\nConditions that could mitigate security concerns:\nNone.\nGuideline E (Personal Conduct)\n15.  The Concern.  Conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor,\ndishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified\ninformation.  Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful and candid answers\nduring the security clearance process or any other failure to cooperate with the security\nclearance process.\nCondition that could raise a security concern:\n16. (a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from\nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used\nto conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or\nstatus, determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary\nresponsibilities.\nConditions that could mitigate security concerns:\nNone.\nForeign Influence\n6.  The Concern.  Foreign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the\nindividual has divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or\ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way that is not\nin U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by any foreign interest.\nAdjudication under this Guideline can and should consider the identity of the foreign\ncountry in which the foreign contact or financial interest is located, including, but not\n\n6\nlimited to, such considerations as whether the foreign country is known to target United\nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a risk of\nterrorism.\nConditions that could raise a security concern:\n7.  (a) contact with a foreign family member, business or professional associate,\nfriend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident of a foreign country if that contact\ncreates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or\ncoercion; \n7.  (d) sharing living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of citizenship\nstatus, if that relationship creates a heightened risk of foreign inducement, manipulation,\npressure, or coercion;\nConditions that could mitigate security concerns:\n8. (a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which\nthese persons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in that country\nare such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a position of having to choose\nbetween the interests of a foreign individual, group, organization, or government and the\ninterests of the U.S;\n8. (b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of\nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country is so minimal,\nor the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in the U.S.,\nthat the individual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S.\ninterest.\nIn addition, as set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive at pages 18-19, in\nevaluating the relevance of an individual\u2019s conduct, the Administrative Judge should\nconsider the following general factors:\na.  The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct;\nb. The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation;\nc.  The frequency and recency of the conduct;\nd.  The individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct;\ne.  The extent to which participation is voluntary;\nf.  The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral\nchanges;\n\n7\ng.  The motivation for the conduct; \nh. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress; and \ni.  The likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nThe eligibility criteria established in the DoD Directive identify personal\ncharacteristics and conduct which are reasonably related to the ultimate question,\nposed in Section 2 of Executive Order 10865, of whether it is \u201cclearly consistent with the\nnational interest\u201d to grant an Applicant\u2019s request for access to classified information.\nThe DoD Directive states, \u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a\nsufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the person is\nan acceptable security risk.  Eligibility for access to classified information is predicated\nupon the individual meeting these personnel security guidelines.  The adjudicative\nprocess is the careful weighing of a number of variables known as the whole-person\nconcept.  Available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable\nand unfavorable should be considered in reaching a determination.\u201d  The Administrative\nJudge can draw only those inferences or conclusions that have reasonable and logical\nbasis in the evidence of record.  The Judge cannot draw inferences or conclusions\nbased on evidence which is speculative or conjectural in nature.  Finally, as emphasized\nby President Eisenhower in Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under this order\n. . . shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a\ndetermination as to the loyalty of the Applicant concerned.\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn the defense industry, the security of classified industrial secrets is entrusted to\ncivilian workers who must be counted upon to safeguard such sensitive information\ntwenty-four hours per day, seven days per week.  The Government is therefore\nappropriately concerned when available information indicates that an Applicant for\nclearance may be involved in drug abuse, personal conduct, and foreign contacts that\ndemonstrates poor judgment or unreliability.\nIt is the Government\u2019s responsibility to present substantial evidence to support\nthe finding of a nexus, or rational connection, between the Applicant\u2019s conduct and the\ncontinued holding of a security clearance.  If such a case has been established, the\nburden then shifts to the Applicant to go forward with evidence in rebuttal, explanation\nor mitigation, which is sufficient to overcome or outweigh the Government\u2019s case.  The\nApplicant bears the ultimate burden of persuasion in proving that it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant him a security clearance.\nIn this case the Government has met its initial burden of proving that the\nApplicant has a history of illegal drug use (Guideline H), the appearance of dishonesty\n(Guideline E) and foreign influence (Guideline B).  The totality of this evidence indicates\npoor judgment, unreliability and untrustworthiness on the part of the Applicant.  Because\n\n8\nof the scope and nature of the Applicant's conduct, I conclude there is a nexus or\nconnection with his security clearance eligibility.  Considering all of the evidence, the\nApplicant has not introduced persuasive evidence in rebuttal, explanation or mitigation\nthat is sufficient to overcome the Government's case.  \nThe Applicant has used marijuana while working for a defense contractor.  He\nknew at the time that the use of marijuana is illegal, against company policy, and\nagainst DoD regulation.  His most recent use of any controlled substance occurred in\nJune 2009, just last year.  Furthermore, during an interview with a DoD investigator in\nAugust 2008, he stated that he may use illegal drugs in the future.  He later changed his\nstatement indicating that he will never use any illegal drug in the future, and consents to\nhaving his security clearance automatically revoked if he does.  Given his past history,\nthere is no guarantee that he will remain drug free in the future or that his word can be\nrelied upon.  Although the probability is low that he will return to drug use, the possibility\nexists, and poses a security risk that cannot be ignored.  Under Guideline H, Drug\nInvolvement, Disqualifying Conditions 25.(a) any drug abuse, and 25.(c) illegal drug\npossession, including cultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase, sale or\ndistribution; or possession of drug paraphernalia apply.  None of the mitigating\nconditions are applicable.  Accordingly, I find against the Applicant under Guideline H,\nDrug Involvement. \n \nTurning to Guideline E, I find that the Applicant was confused, but that he did not\ndeliberately falsify his security clearance application in regard to his illegal drug use.  He\nclearly revealed the full extent of his marijuana use.  He also told the investigator during\nhis interview that he believed he did not use cocaine and that is why he did not reveal\nits use on his security clearance application or in response to interrogatories.  The\nApplicant does not believe that his taste of cocaine is considered, \u201cuse\u201d as defined by\nquestion 24(c) of the security clearance application and therefore he answered the\nquestion in the negative.  Although his interpretation of the situation is wrong, I do not\nfind his falsification to be intentional.  I understand his confusion and do not believe he\nintentionally lied in response to the question.  Accordingly, I find for the Applicant under\nGuideline E, Personal Conduct.    \nAs to his foreign influence under Guideline B, I find that the Applicant\u2019s aunt and\ncousin from Colombia, who live with his parents, do not pose a security risk.  In fact, the\nApplicant feels that they are taking advantage of his parents.  There is no close bond, or\nstrong and deep affection.  He has no legal, ethical or moral obligation to them.  The\nApplicant identifies as an American with loyalty and responsibilities only to the United\nStates.\nIt is also noted that the current political situation in Colombia elevates the cause\nfor concern in this case.  However, the Applicant has no bond of affection with his\nforeign relatives or with Colombia.  Under the particular circumstances of this case, the\nrelationship that he has his aunt and cousin could not potentially cause the Applicant to\nbecome subject to foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion.\nTherefore there is no possibility of foreign influence that could create the potential for\nconduct resulting in the compromise of classified information.  I find that the Applicant is\n\n9\nnot vulnerable to foreign influence.  Accordingly, I find for the Applicant under Guideline\nB (Foreign Influence).\nI have also considered the \u201cwhole-person concept\u201d in evaluating the Applicant\u2019s\neligibility for access to classified information.  The Applicant is a young many who is still\nnaive and immature.  As recently as last year, he used marijuana in total disregard for\nthe law, company policy and DoD regulation.  By doing so, he reveals a defect in\njudgment.  Under the particular facts of this case, the totality of the conduct set forth\nunder all of the guidelines viewed as a whole, support a whole-person assessment of\npoor judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, a lack of candor, an unwillingness to\ncomply with rules and regulations, and/or other characteristics indicating that the person\nmay not properly safeguard classified information.  \nConsidering all the evidence, the Applicant has not met the mitigating conditions\nof Guideline H of the adjudicative guidelines set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive.\nAccordingly, he has not met his ultimate burden of persuasion under Guideline H.  This\nApplicant is not sufficiently trustworthy and does not meet the eligibility requirements for\naccess to classified information.  Accordingly, I find against the Applicant under\nGuideline H (Drug Involvement).  Guidelines E (Personal Conduct) and Guideline B\n(Foreign Influence) are found for the Applicant.     \nOn balance, it is concluded that the Applicant has failed to overcome the\nGovernment's case opposing his request for a  security clearance.  Accordingly, the\nevidence supports a finding against the Applicant as to the factual and conclusionary\nallegations expressed in Paragraph 1 of the SOR.  Paragraphs  2 and 3 of the SOR are\nfound for the Applicant.\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal findings For or Against the Applicant on the allegations in the SOR, as\nrequired by Paragraph 25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive are:\nParagraph 1: Against the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.a.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.b.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.c.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.d.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.e.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n   \nParagraph 2: For the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  2.a.:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  2.b.:\nFor the Applicant.\nParagraph 3: For the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  3.a.:\nFor the Applicant.\n\n10\nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for\nthe Applicant.\nDarlene Lokey Anderson\nAdministrative Judge\n",

On April 10, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals\n(DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under\nfinancial considerations (Guideline F). The action was taken under Executive Order\n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as\namended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel\nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and\nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and\nmade effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued on or after\nSeptember 1, 2006.\nAugust 31, 2009\n\n2\nApplicant furnished her answer to the SOR on April 28, 2009. She requested a\ndecision be made on the record in lieu of a hearing. A copy of the Government\u2019s File of\nRelevant Material (FORM, the government\u2019s evidence in support of the allegations of\nthe SOR) was sent to Applicant on May 18, 2009. Applicant received the FORM on\nJune 1, 2009. Her response was received on June 28, 2009, and is a part of the record.\nThe case file was assigned to me on July 15, 2009. \nFindings of Fact\nThe SOR alleges 19 delinquent debts and one judgment totaling approximately\n$38,000. Applicant admitted she owed the accounts. She provided documentation of\nmaking an initial payment of $100 in March 2009, followed by a payment of $449.25 in\nApril 2009 under her debt plan payment schedule. Her answer includes documentary\nproof, dated March 6, 2009, that she paid subparagraph 1.o. of the SOR (receipt for\nnautilus center bill).\nApplicant is 38 years old and is employed as a tier 1 call center support\ntechnician with a defense contractor. She has been married for almost nine years, and\nhas one 17-year-old child. She attended college from 2001 to December 2004. She\nindicated in Item 5 (SCA) that she resigned from previous jobs because of her\ndaughter\u2019s medical problems. Then, Applicant developed medical problems. She also\nnoted in the employment section of her SCA that she was unemployed from January\n2001 to February 2003, and from September to December 2003. In a one-page\nstatement attached to her answer, she explained that her migraine headaches and\nstroke symptoms over the years prevented her from remaining current on her debts. If\nneeded, she stated she could provide medical records verifying her illnesses. No\nadditional information was provided. Applicant seeks a security clearance. \nIn Applicant\u2019s interrogatory responses (Item 6) dated March 9, 2009, she\nprovided her debt plan enrollment documentation calling for monthly payments of\n$449.25 for a 60-month period. The plan identified creditors listed in subparagraphs\n1.a., 1.c., 1.d., 1.l, 1.m., 1.n., 1.p., 1.q., and 1.t. The plan documentation also provided\nApplicant with advice on how to establish a budget and get control over her finances. \nIn her response to the FORM dated June 28, 2009, Applicant provided proof of\npaying the creditors in subparagraphs 1.b., 1.e., 1.f., 1.g., 1.h., 1.i., 1j., and 1.k. On\nJune 12, 2009, she paid $438.02, to satisfy the above-referenced creditors (response to\nFORM). She also inserted documentation in her response verifying she paid the parking\ninfraction (subparagraph 1.s.) on March 4, 2009. Applicant still owes 10 creditors\n$37,135. The debts fell delinquent between 2003 and September 2005.\nCharacter Evidence\nApplicant submitted no character endorsements from coworkers or supervisors.\nShe furnished no documentation concerning her illnesses or follow-up documentation\non her status in the debt plan.\n\n3\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. These guidelines\nare applied in conjunction with the variables listed in the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The\nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person,\npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration.\nReasonable doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to classified\ninformation will be resolved in favor of national security. In reaching this decision, I have\ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the evidence\ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere\nspeculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship\nis not restricted to normal duty hours. Rather, the relationship is an-around-the-clock\nresponsibility between an applicant and the federal government. The government\nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk\nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified\ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation\nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.\nAnalysis\nFinancial Considerations (FC)\n\u00b6 18. The Concern. \u201cFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts,\nand meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about\nan individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. An\nindividual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to\ngenerate funds. Compulsive gambling is a concern as it may lead to financial crimes\nincluding espionage. Affluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is\n\n4\nalso a security concern. It may indicate proceeds from financially profitable criminal\nacts.\u201d\nThe credit reports dated October 3, 2008 and March 26, 2009 indicate that\nApplicant\u2019s delinquent financial history extends from 2003 to the current time because\nmost of the debt remains unpaid. She accumulated 20 debts totaling about $38,000. FC\ndisqualifying condition (DC) \u00b6 19.a. (inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts) and FC\nDC \u00b6 19.c. (a history not meeting financial obligations) apply. \nEvidence of financial problems may be potentially mitigated by FC mitigating\ncondition (MC) \u00b6 20.a. (the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or\noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt\non the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment); FC MC \u00b6 20.b. (the\nconditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s\ncontrol and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances); and, FC MC \u00b6\n20.c. (the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there\nare clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control). \nFC MC \u00b6 20.a. does not apply. Even after her satisfaction of 10 delinquencies,\nshe still owes approximately $37,500 to 10 creditors. Her financial problems, which are\nlikely to persist, continue to cast doubt on her judgment and reliability.  \nFC MC \u00b6 20.b. applies in part based on Applicant\u2019s medical problems and her\ndaughter\u2019s medical problems. However, without detailed medical records establishing\nspecific reasons why Applicant could not work, I cannot speculate about the\nseriousness of Applicant\u2019s headaches or cardiovascular condition. Therefore, the\nmitigating weight assigned to Applicant\u2019s medical problems is decreased even though\nshe paid 10 of the smaller debts in early 2009. \nThe documentation Applicant provided in her interrogatory responses shows she\nreceived some counseling from the debt plan representatives. Also, based on the two\nplan payments she made in March and April 2009, Applicant appeared to be committed\nto re-establishing control over her financial obligations. However, her response to the\nFORM makes no reference to the debt plan, a critical piece of evidence that would have\nprovided updated insight about her commitment to her debt plan, and eventual\nrestoration of her financial profile. Applicant receives only limited mitigation under FC\nMC \u00b6 20.c. as there is still no clear indication her debts are being resolved.\nApplicant exercised good judgment by joining the plan in March 2009 and paying\noff 10 of 20 creditors between March and June 2009. But, with no current evidence\nabout the debt consolidation plan, I must conclude she abandoned the plan and has no\nstrategy on how to repay the remaining creditors. On balance, the limited mitigation that\nApplicant is entitled to under FC MC \u00b6 20.c. and FC MC \u00b6 20.d. falls short of\novercoming the adverse evidence under FC DC \u00b6 20.a. and FC DC \u00b6 20.c. Accordingly,\nthe FC guideline is found against her. \n\n5\nWhole Person Concept (WPC) \nI have examined the evidence utilizing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions\nof the FC guideline. Even though I have resolved the FC guideline against Applicant, the\ncase still must be weighed within the context of nine variables known as the whole\nperson concept. In evaluating the relevance of an individual\u2019s conduct, the\nadministrative judge should consider the following factors: \nAG \u00b6 2(a) (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich the participation was voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and, (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nThe credit reports show that Applicant\u2019s financial problems occurred between\n2003 and September 2005. Applicant referred to her daughter\u2019s medical problems and\nher medical problems as the chief reasons she could not keep her debts current.\nHowever, just as she had provided proof she paid certain debts listed in the SOR, she\nshould have provided the medical records to provide detail as to why she could not\nwork. \nApplicant exercised good judgment in joining the debt consolidation plan in\nMarch 2009, and providing proof of two payments under the plan schedule. However,\nmaking two more payments in May and June 2009, in combination with character\nevidence, may have provided justifiable confidence to believe Applicant was truly\ncommitted to succeeding with the plan. Given (1) the lack of medical records, (2)\nadditional information regarding the consolidation plan, and (3) character evidence, I\ncannot find in Applicant\u2019s favor under the financial guideline. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1 (Financial Considerations, Guideline F): AGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b.\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e.\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f.\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g.\nFor Applicant\n\n6\nSubparagraph 1.h.\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.i.\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.j.\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.k.\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.l.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.m.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.n.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.o.\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.p.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.q.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.r.\nAgainst Applicant.\nSubparagraph 1.s.\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.t.\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.

Cervi, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nHENRY, Mary E., Administrative Judge:\nBased upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I\nconclude that Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\nApplicant filled out her Security Clearance Application (SF 86) on December 20,\n2007 and signed it on January 7, 2008. The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals\n(DOHA) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns\nunder Guideline F on April 13, 2009. The action was taken under Executive Order\n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as\namended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel\nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the\nrevised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29,\n2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September\n1, 2006. \n \nNovember 13, 2009\n\nW hen  SOR allegations are controverted, the government bears the burden of producing evidence sufficient\n1\nto prove controverted allegations. Directive, \u00b6 E3.1.14. \u201cThat burden has two components. First, the\ngovernment must establish by substantial evidence that the facts and events alleged in the SOR indeed took\nplace. Second, the government must establish a nexus between the existence of the established facts and\nevents and a legitimate security concern.\u201d See ISCR Case No. 07-18525 at 4 (App. Bd. Feb. 18, 2009),\n(concurring and dissenting, in part) (citations omitted).\nItem 5.\n2\nId; Item 4.\n3\nItem 4; Item 7.\n4\n2\nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on May 12, 2009. She submitted a\nwritten response to the SOR allegations on June 2, 2009, and requested a decision on\nthe written record in lieu of a hearing. \nDepartment Counsel prepared a File of Relevant Material (FORM) and mailed\nApplicant a complete copy on August 17, 2009. Applicant received the FORM on\nSeptember 1, 2009. She had 30 days from receipt of the FORM to file objections and\nsubmit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation. She has not submitted a\nresponse or additional evidence. DOHA assigned this case to me on November 9,\n2009. The government submitted eight exhibits, which have been marked as Item 1-8\nand admitted into the record. Applicant\u2019s response to the SOR has been marked as\nItem 4.\nFindings of Fact\nIn her Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the factual allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a,\n1.c-1e, 1.g, 1.h, and 1.j of the SOR, with explanations. She denied the factual\nallegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.f and 1.i of the SOR.  She neither admitted nor denied the factual\n1\nallegations in \u00b6 1. b of the SOR. This allegation is deemed denied.\nApplicant, who is 31 years old, works as a software engineer for a Department of\nDefense contractor. She began her employment with this employer in June 2000 and\nhas worked steadily since this time.2\nApplicant married in July 2000 and separated from her husband in July 2004.\nThey are not divorced. She has two children, ages 5 and 4. Her estranged husband\ndoes not provide her with any child support.   \n3\nApplicant\u2019s debts arose after she and her husband separated. She could not pay\nall her living and household expenses on her income alone. As a result, the mortgagor\nforeclosed on her house and she incurred other significant, unpaid debt. Her car was\nrepossessed and a judgment was obtained against her for nearly $30,000.4\n\nItem 4; record.\n5\nId.\n6\nItem 7; record.\n7\n3\nApplicant states that she is working with a credit specialist to pay her outstanding\ndebts. She has not provided a copy of her contract with this credit specialist, a list of the\ndebts which are being managed through this credit specialist, or verified any payments\nshe has made on her debts through this individual.5\nApplicant did not submit any evidence which showed her monthly income and her\nmonthly expenses. She denied owing the debts in SOR allegations \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.f, and 1.i in\nher response to the SOR, but she failed to provide proof that she paid these debts or\nthat she is not responsible for these debts. Outside of her summary written response,\nApplicant did not provide any documents which address the status of her debts and\nshow her current financial situation.  \n6\nThe credit reported dated March 19, 2009 indicates that Applicant disputed the\ndebts listed in SOR allegations 1.c., 1.d, and 1.e. By admitting these factual allegations,\nApplicant agreed that she was indebted to these creditors. She has not provided any\ndocumentary evidence which reflects how her disputes of these debts have been\nresolved.7\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in\nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based\n\n4\non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d An\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship\ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government\nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk\nan applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified\ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation\nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set\nout in AG & 18:      \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nAG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.\nSimilarly under AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise\nsecurity concerns. Applicant accumulated delinquent debt subsequent to her separation\nfrom her husband in 2004. She has been unable to pay these obligations for a period of\ntime. The evidence is sufficient to raise these potentially disqualifying conditions.\n\nAG \u00b6\u00b6 20 (f) is not applicable in this case.\n8\n5\nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security\nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG \u00b6 20(a), the disqualifying condition\nmay be mitigated where Athe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or\noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt\non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ Applicant\u2019s\ndebts are recent and occurred after she and her husband separated. Her separation is\nnot an unusual situation. \nUnder AG & 20(b), mitigation can occur when Athe conditions that resulted in the\nfinancial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a\nbusiness downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation),\nand the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.@ Evidence that Athe\nperson has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear\nindications that the problem is being resolved or is under control@ is potentially mitigating\nunder AG & 20(c). Similarly, AG & 20(d) applies where the evidence shows Athe\nindividual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve\ndebts.\u201d Applicant and her husband separated in 2004. Since their separation, he has\nfailed to provide child support for their children. While her separation and her estranged\nhusband\u2019s failure to pay child support impacted her finances, Applicant has not provided\nany information which shows she acted reasonably under these circumstances. Rather,\nthe evidence of record indicates that she lost control of her finances. Applicant has not\nprovided evidence which shows she retained a credit specialist to help with her finances\nand, if she did, what debts are being resolved or have been resolved. Finally, Applicant\nhas not provided any evidence which shows she made a good-faith effort to repay her\ncreditors. The record contains no evidence which would raise the application of these\nmitigating conditions. \nAG \u00b6 20(e) provides that if \u201cthe individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the\nlegitimacy of the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides\ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of\nactions to resolve the issue,\u201d she may mitigate the government\u2019s security concerns.\nWhile the March 2009 credit report indicates that Applicant disputed three debts, she\nacknowledged owing the debts and has not provided information showing the result of\nher dispute. Applicant has not established any facts which show she has mitigated the\ngovernment\u2019s security concerns.  \n8\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of an applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the\nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):\n\n6\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole person concept. The decision to grant or deny a security\nclearance requires a careful weighing of all relevant factors, both favorable and\nunfavorable. In so doing, an administrative judge must review all the evidence of record,\nnot a single item in isolation, to determine if a security concern is established and then\nwhether it is mitigated. A determination of an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security\nclearance should not be made as punishment for specific past conduct, but on a\nreasonable and careful evaluation of all the evidence of record to decide if a nexus\nexists between established facts and a legitimate security concern. \nThe evidence in support of denying a security clearance to applicant under the\nwhole person concept is more substantial than the evidence in support of a grant. In\nreaching conclusion, I considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions\nin light of all the facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant married in\n2000 and separated from her husband in 2004. She has two young children she is\nraising on her own, without any financial support from her estranged husband. She\nbegan work for her current employer more than nine years ago and has no disciplinary\nproblems at work. \nAs a result of her separation, Applicant began to develop financial problems. In\nthe last three or four years, Applicant\u2019s financial problems have become very severe.\nThe mortgagor foreclosed on her house and she has a large judgment against her for a\nrepossessed automobile. She indicated that she is working with a credit specialist to\nhelp resolve her credit issues, but she has not provided any evidence showing what the\ncredit specialist is doing on her behalf. Applicant has significant debt problems, which\nare not resolved or under control. She has not shown a track record for paying her\ndebts and living within her current income.\nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s\neligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude\nApplicant has not mitigated the security concerns arising from her finances.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\n\n7\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a-1.k:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n                                                              \nMARY E. HENRY\nAdministrative Judge\n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Under Guideline C, the government alleged that Applicant applied for and received a Panamanian identification card (SOR \u00b6 1.a); that, as of the date of the SOR, she possessed a valid Panamanian passport (SOR \u00b6 1.b); that, in July 2002, she used her Panamanian passport to leave Panama (SOR \u00b6 1.c); that, in March 2009, she was not willing to relinquish her Panamanian passport (SOR \u00b6 1.d); that, in March 2009, she was considering retiring to Panama and that her Panamanian citizenship would allow her to live legally in that country when she retires (SOR \u00b6 1.e); and that, in March 2009, she was seeking employment in Panama and Spain, and that her Panamanian citizenship would facilitate obtaining \u201cworking papers\u201d in Spain (SOR \u00b6 1.f).

However, in early 2007, she was let go from that\njob only to be rehired in late 2008. At that time, her e-QIP was resubmitted and a\nbackground investigation completed. After reviewing the results of that investigation,\nadjudicators for the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued to\nApplicant a set of interrogatories  to obtain clarification of, and/or additional information\n1\nabout potentially disqualifying information in her background. After reviewing the results\nof the background investigation, including her response to the interrogatories, DOHA\nDecember 11, 2009\n\n Required by Executive Order 10865, as amended, and by DoD Directive 5220.6 (Directive), as amended.\n2\n Adjudication of this case is controlled by the revised Adjudicative Guidelines, approved by the President on\n3\nDecember 29, 2005,which were implemented by the Department of Defense on September 1, 2006. Pending\nofficial revision of the Directive, the revised Adjudicative Guidelines take precedence over the guidelines listed\nin Enclosure 2 to the Directive.\n2\nadjudicators were unable to make a preliminary affirmative finding  that it is clearly\n2\nconsistent with the national interest to allow Applicant access to classified information.\nOn April 30, 2009, DOHA issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging\nfacts which, if established, raise security concerns addressed in the revised Adjudicative\nGuidelines  under Guideline C (foreign preference).\n3\nOn May 19, 2009, Applicant responded to the SOR and requested a hearing. The\ncase was assigned to me on July 24, 2009, and I convened a hearing on August 26,\n2009. The parties appeared as scheduled. The government presented two exhibits,\nwhich were admitted without objection as Government Exhibits (Gx.) 1 and 2. Applicant\npresented one exhibit, which was admitted without objection as Applicant\u2019s Exhibit (Ax.)\nA. I also left the record open after the hearing to give Applicant time to submit additional\nrelevant information. On August 28, 2009, I received Applicant\u2019s timely submission of\none additional exhibit. It has been admitted into the record without objection as Ax. B.\nDOHA received the transcript of hearing (Tr.) on September 3, 2009.\nFindings of Fact\nUnder Guideline C, the government alleged that Applicant applied for and\nreceived a Panamanian identification card (SOR \u00b6 1.a); that, as of the date of the SOR,\nshe possessed a valid Panamanian passport (SOR \u00b6 1.b); that, in July 2002, she used\nher Panamanian passport to leave Panama (SOR \u00b6 1.c); that, in March 2009, she was\nnot willing to relinquish her Panamanian passport (SOR \u00b6 1.d); that, in March 2009, she\nwas considering retiring to Panama and that her Panamanian citizenship would allow\nher to live legally in that country when she retires (SOR \u00b6 1.e); and that, in March 2009,\nshe was seeking employment in Panama and Spain, and that her Panamanian\ncitizenship would facilitate obtaining \u201cworking papers\u201d in Spain (SOR \u00b6 1.f). Applicant\nadmitted with explanation each of these allegations. In addition to the facts established\nthrough her admissions, I have made the following findings of relevant fact.\nApplicant is 51 years old and is seeking a security clearance in connection with\nher employment by a defense contractor. Applicant\u2019s father is a retired U.S. Army senior\nenlisted member living in Panama. Applicant was born in the United States, but was\nraised through her high school years in U.S. territory abroad (the Panama Canal Zone),\nwhich was where her father was stationed for most of his Army career. He was\nassigned to special forces and spent much of his career conducting jungle combat\ntraining for personnel heading to the Vietnam War. Applicant was educated in U.S.\nschools in Panama. (Tr. 20 - 21)\nApplicant\u2019s mother was Panamanian. Applicant\u2019s father was born in the United\nStates, but raised in Panama. Applicant\u2019s paternal grandfather was a Filipino-American,\n\n3\nand her paternal grandmother was Panamanian. Applicant has Panamanian citizenship\nthrough her mother and not her father, because Applicant\u2019s mother registered Applicant\nand her siblings, all of whom live in the U.S., with the Panamanian government as\nPanamanian citizens born abroad. Applicant\u2019s father is a U.S. citizen only, because he\nwas never registered as a Panamanian citizen born abroad as was Applicant. He is\nretired and living in Panama on his U.S. military retirement. (Answer; Gx. 2; Tr. 39 - 41) \nApplicant\u2019s father suffers from Alzheimer\u2019s disease and requires some assistance\nin managing his personal, financial, and medical affairs. He is receiving medical and\nliving assistance in Panama, which is paid for and managed through his TriCare\nbenefits. Currently, among her siblings in the U.S. and other family in Panama,\nApplicant is the principal person responsible for family monitoring of her father\u2019s affairs.\nFinancially, it is much more efficient for Applicant\u2019s father to live and receive care in\nPanama. He is also more comfortable there. When he travels to live with Applicant or\nher siblings in the U.S., he has trouble adjusting and becomes disoriented and, at times,\naggressive. (Answer; Gx. 2; Tr. 25 - 29, 37 - 39, 41 - 43)\nApplicant was married from 1993 until 2000. At some point, she and her ex-\nhusband considered buying a vacation home or property in Panama. In 1998, she\nobtained a Panamanian passport. She has renewed it twice since then. Her current\nPanamanian passport is valid through January 2014. She also has a valid U.S. passport\nthat she last renewed in May 2003. (Tr. 25, 32; Gx. 1; Gx. 2; Ax. B)\nIn 2002, Applicant obtained a Panamanian \u201ccedula,\u201d which is a government-\nissued identification card. It entitles Applicant to vote in Panama, which Applicant has\nnot done. Panamanian citizens are often asked to present their cedula when conducting\nbusiness with Panamanian officials and when obtaining benefits of Panamanian\ncitizenship. (Tr. 36 - 38) As a United States citizen, she does not need a cedula, and\nshe can travel to and from Panama on her U.S. passport. She has used her\nPanamanian passport instead of her U.S. passport several times, but only to enter\nPanama. She does so because it gets her through inspection lines faster and because\nshe does not have to pay entry fees. In 2002, Applicant also used her Panamanian\npassport to leave Panama. (Answer; Gx. 2; Ax. B) \nApplicant claims that the primary reason she needs a Panamanian passport and\ncedula is to manage her father\u2019s affairs. Her position is that the passport and cedula\nfacilitate her interaction with Panamanian officials, but she acknowledged at hearing\nthat she would be able to assist her father without those documents. For example, his\nmoney is in a U.S.-based federal credit union to which Applicant has access without\ntraveling to Panama. (Answer; Gx. 2; Tr. 44 - 46)\nIn about 1994, Applicant had to travel to Beirut, Lebanon, in connection with her\nex-husband\u2019s employment. She obtained a single-use passport from the U.S. State\nDepartment for that purpose, and her travel to Lebanon, which at the time was in the\nmidst of a civil war, was sanctioned by the U.S. government. (Answer; Tr. 22 - 23, 51)\nApplicant does not want to relinquish her Panamanian passport. (Answer; Gx. 2)\nApplicant is multi-lingual, has a master\u2019s degree in international transactions, and has\n\n Directive. 6.3.\n4\n See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988).\n5\n See Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, 531.\n6\n4\nexperience working in international businesses. She has been generally unemployed\nsince about June 2008, and has been seeking employment opportunities in the U.S., as\nwell as in Panama and Spain, where Panamanian citizenship can increase her\nemployment prospects. (Gx. 2; Tr. 47) Her former employer testified that she is highly\nreliable, trustworthy, and professional. He will rehire her if she is approved for a security\nclearance. (Tr. 54 - 58)\nPolicies\nEach security clearance decision must be a fair, impartial, and commonsense\ndetermination based on examination of all available relevant and material information,4\nand consideration of the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in the revised\nAdjudicative Guidelines (AG). Decisions must also reflect consideration of the factors\nlisted in \u00b6 2(a) of the new guidelines. Commonly referred to as the \u201cwhole person\u201d\nconcept, those factors are:\n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nThe presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not\ndeterminative of a conclusion for or against an applicant. However, specific applicable\nguidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against them as they\nrepresent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to classified\ninformation. In this case, the pleadings and the information presented by the parties\nrequire consideration of the security concerns and adjudicative factors addressed under\nAG \u00b6 9, Guideline C (Foreign Preference).\nA security clearance decision is intended only to resolve whether it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest  for an applicant to either receive or continue to\n5\nhave access to classified information. The government bears the initial burden of\nproducing admissible information on which it based the preliminary decision to deny or\nrevoke a security clearance for an applicant. Additionally, the government must prove\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. If the government meets its burden, it then falls\nto the applicant to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the government\u2019s case. Because no\none has a \u201cright\u201d to a security clearance, an applicant bears a heavy burden of\npersuasion.  \n6\n\n See Egan; Revised Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 2(b).\n7\n W hile the government does not require renunciation of one\u2019s foreign citizenship, an expressed willingness\n8\nto do so would benefit her through application of AG \u00b6 11(b) (the individual has expressed a willingness to\nrenounce dual citizenship).\n5\nA person who has access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government based on trust and confidence. Thus, the government\nhas a compelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgment,\nreliability and trustworthiness of one who will protect the national interests as his or her\nown. The \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of\nany reasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access to classified information\nin favor of the government.7\nAnalysis\nForeign Preference.\nThe government presented sufficient information to support the facts alleged in\nSOR \u00b6 1. Those allegations, which Applicant admits, raise security concerns about\nwhether Applicant may place the interests of another country ahead of those of the\nUnited States. Specifically, the security concern stated in AG \u00b6 9 (Guideline C: Foreign\nPreference) is that, \u201c[w]hen an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference\nfor a foreign country over the United States, then he or she may be prone to provide\ninformation or make decisions that are harmful to the interests of the United States.\u201d\nThe facts established show, as alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a  - 1.c, that Applicant derived\nPanamanian citizenship from her mother and decided to exercise that citizenship\nbeginning around 1998, when she obtained a Panamanian passport. She has used that\npassport, at times, in preference to a U.S. passport she has held since at least 2003.\nFurther, she obtained a Panamanian identification card in 2002. These facts require\napplication of the disqualifying conditions listed under AG \u00b6 10(a) (exercise of any right,\nprivilege or obligation of foreign citizenship after becoming a U.S. citizen or through the\nforeign citizenship of a family member. This includes but is not limited to: (1) possession\nof a current foreign passport...). \nBy contrast, the record does not support any of the mitigating factors under AG \u00b6\n11. Applicant derived her foreign citizenship from her mother. However, she has actively\nexercised her foreign citizenship since at least 1998 through the acquisition, use, and\nongoing possession of a Panamanian passport and cedula. Thus, the mitigating\ncondition at AG \u00b6 11(a) (dual citizenship is based solely on parents' citizenship or birth\nin a foreign country) may not be applied here. Further, she has not expressed a\nwillingness to renounce her foreign citizenship,  and has specifically stated that she is\n8\nunwilling to relinquish her Panamanian passport. Therefore, the mitigating condition at\nAG \u00b6 11(e) (the passport has been destroyed, surrendered to the cognizant security\nauthority, or otherwise invalidated) does not apply. Because she was born a U.S.\ncitizen, and because she exercised her foreign citizenship as an adult, the mitigating\ncondition at AG \u00b6 11(c) (exercise of the rights, privileges, or obligations of foreign\ncitizenship occurred before the individual became a U.S. citizen or when the individual\n\n See footnote 4, supra.\n9\n See footnote 7, supra. \n10\n6\nwas a minor) is not applicable. Finally, the mitigating condition at AG \u00b6 11(d) (use of a\nforeign passport is approved by the cognizant security authority) does not apply.\nApplicant\u2019s possession of a Panamanian passport was not sanctioned by the U.S.\ngovernment, and she did not  get permission to have a foreign passport, despite her\nexperience in getting State Department permission for travel to Lebanon in the 1990s. \nApplicant\u2019s possession of a foreign passport allows her to travel unhindered by\nthe legitimate need for the U.S. government to manage information about travel in and\nout of the country. More broadly, and despite her sincere expressions of preference for\nU.S. interests, Applicant\u2019s actions in furtherance of her Panamanian citizenship raise\nlegitimate security concerns expressed through Guideline C about her willingness or\nability to protect U.S. interests in preference to all others. The allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c\n- 1.f are supported by the government\u2019s information and by Applicant\u2019s admissions. By\nthemselves, they are not disqualifying. However, these allegations establish that\nApplicant will continue to use her foreign citizenship, at times for personal gain, in\npreference to her U.S. citizenship. As such, SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c - 1.f legitimately establish facts\nwhich undermine her claims that she would not place the interests of a foreign nation\nahead of U.S. interests. On balance, Applicant has failed to mitigate the security\nconcerns raised by the government\u2019s information.\nWhole Person Concept. \nI have evaluated the facts presented and have applied the appropriate\nadjudicative factors under Guideline C. I have also reviewed the record before me in the\ncontext of the whole person factors listed in AG \u00b6 2(a). Applicant is 51 years old and\npresumed to be a mature, responsible adult. Indeed, she is well-educated, multi-lingual\nand multi-cultural, all of which gives her a solid background in international business. As\nthe eldest child in her immediate family, she is almost single-mindedly devoted to the\ncare of her elderly and ailing father. Her use of her Panamanian citizenship to facilitate\nthe care of her father, to expand her employment prospects, and to plan for her\nretirement are understandable. Certainly, there has been no misconduct here. However,\nin the context of deciding whether to allow her access to classified information, the\ntotality of Applicant\u2019s circumstances place on her the heavy burden of demonstrating,\nwhich she has not done, that she would not be compromised by conflicting interests.\nBecause it is unlikely that Applicant\u2019s circumstances will change in the foreseeable\nfuture, a fair and commonsense assessment  of all available information shows\n9\nApplicant has not overcome the doubts about her suitability under these circumstances.\nBecause protection of the national interest is paramount in these determinations, such\ndoubts must be resolved in favor of the government.10\n\n7\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by section\nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline C:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.f:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the foregoing, it is not clearly consistent with the national interest\nfor Applicant to have access to classified information. Applicant\u2019s request for a security\nclearance is denied.\n                            \n                                                    \nMATTHEW E. MALONE\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Jeffreys, Esquire, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro Se \n \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \nCREAN, Thomas M., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant submitted a Questionnaire for Sensitive Position (SF 86) to obtain a \nsecurity clearance as part of his employment on October 15, 2008. On April 16, 2009, \nthe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons \n(SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under Guideline F for financial \nconsiderations. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of \nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative \nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective \nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. Applicant \nacknowledged receipt of the SOR on April 21, 2009. \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on April 26, 2009. He denied one and \nadmitted 22 of the allegations under Guideline F with explanation. He also provided \ninformation why the financial considerations security concern should be mitigated. He \nrequested a hearing before an administrative judge. Department Counsel was prepared \nto proceed on May 13, 2009, and the case was assigned to me on May 21, 2009. \n \n1 \n \n \nJuly 29, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n \nDOHA issued a Notice of Hearing on May 22, 2009, for a hearing on June 11, 2009. I \nconvened the hearing as scheduled. The government offered four exhibits, marked \nGovernment Exhibits (Gov. Ex.) 1 through 4, which were received without objection. \nApplicant testified on his behalf. Applicant offered six exhibits, marked Applicant \nExhibits (App. Ex.) A through F, which were received without objection. The record was \nheld open at Applicant's request so he could submit additional documents. Applicant \ntimely submitted one document with six attachments marked App. Ex. G, which was \nreceived without objection (See, Gov. Ex 5 Memorandum, dated July 9, 2009). DOHA \nreceived the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on June 25, 2009. Based upon a review of \nthe case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified \ninformation is denied. \n \nProcedural Issues \n \n \nApplicant signed for the Notice of Hearing on May 28, 2009. Applicant is entitled \nto 15 days notice of hearing (Directive E3.1.8). Applicant discussed with Department \nCounsel the hearing date of June 11, 2009, prior to the mailing of a Notice of Hearing. \nAccordingly, actual notice was given more than 15 days prior to the hearing. Applicant \nsigned for the Notice of Hearing only 14 days prior to the hearing. He waived the 15 \ndays notice requirement (Tr. 5-6). \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nAfter a thorough review of the pleadings, transcript, and exhibits, I make the \nfollowing essential findings of fact.  \n \nApplicant is 37 years old and has been a knowledge management analysis for a \ndefense contractor since September 2008. He is single and a college graduate. He is \nworking on his master's degree and only has to complete his thesis for award of the \ndegree. Applicant completed a financial statement as part of counseling with a debt \nmanagement firm. He listed on the form that his monthly income at his new position is \n$3,682, with monthly expenses of $3,408, leaving a monthly remainder of $274. \nApplicant stated at the hearing that his income is accurate but his monthly expenses are \nnow significantly less at about $2,600, leaving monthly discretionary funds of \napproximately $1,100. Applicant moved to another state to accept his current job. When \nhe moved, he could not break the lease for his apartment so he had to continue to pay \nthat rent until April 2009. In addition, he initially leased a car for his transportation need \nat the new location. He purchased a car in January 2009 to cut expenses. With only one \nrent payment and a lower car payment, his expense are now less each month (Tr. 24-\n25, 32, 34, 44-46, App. Ex. E, Debt Management Plan, dated May 13, 2009 at 12-14).   \n \nThere is no security allegation against Applicant for criminal conduct. However, \nthe government presented a criminal justice information report showing that Applicant \nwas convicted and fined for uttering a check against insufficient funds in 1992. He was \nagain convicted and fined for uttering another insufficient funds check in 1997. The \ngovernment contends that while the uttering of insufficient funds checks in 1992 and \n\n \n3 \n \n \n1997 were not criminal conduct for security clearance purposes, this conduct does \nindicate financial problems for Applicant as early as 1992. Applicant noted that both \nchecks were for less than $30 to the same merchant. He did not learn the first check \nwas dishonored until three years later when he was stopped for a traffic offense. For the \nsecond offense, he received a warrant. He immediately paid both checks and court \ncosts when he became aware of the offenses. These were the only insufficient funds \nchecks he uttered in over 27 years of having a checking account (Tr. 12-15, 23-24, 44-\n46; Gov. Ex. 2, criminal justice report, dated October 15, 2008).  \n \nApplicant graduated from college in 2001. He was employed in two different jobs \nuntil March 2003 when he started working as a knowledge analyst. He was laid off from \nthat job in 2005 when the company downsized. He was unemployed for about three \nmonths before he found similar employment at another company as a knowledge \nmanager at a higher salary. He was laid off from that job in April 2006 when the \ncompany lost a contract and did not have the resources to keep him employed. He \nreturned to his home state, lived with his parents to preserve resources, and sought \nemployment. After three months, he was employed by a government agency at about a \nthird of his former salary. His previous salary was $65,000 yearly, and this new job paid \nonly $19,000 yearly. He continued to look for employment in his field until he was hired \nby his present employer in September 2008. Tax returns for the period show total tax \nincome going from $55,762 in 2005, to $29,056 in 2006, to $18,811 in 2007. His present \nsalary is about $70,000 per year. Applicant's performance evaluation for his first few \nmonths with his present employer is that he exceeds expectations (Tr. 15-18; Gov. Ex. \n1, Questionnaire for Sensitive Position, SF 86, dated October 15, 2008; See. App. Ex. \nB, Form 1040, Federal tax return, 2005; App. Ex. C, Form 1040, federal tax return, \n2006; App. Ex. D, Form 1040, federal tax return, 2007; App. Ex. F, Performance \nEvaluation, dated December 2008). \n \nWhen Applicant started employment in his field in 2003, he opened credit card \naccounts and store credit accounts to purchase items and take advantage of store sales \nand deals. He felt he was living within his means and his salary would cover his \nexpenses. Unfortunately he was laid off and lost employment, and was unable to make \nhis credit card payments (Tr. 25-34). Prior to the layoffs, his bills were current (Tr. 42-\n43). Credit reports (Gov. Ex. 3, credit report, dated March 4, 2009; and Gov. Ex. 4, \ncredit report, dated October 15, 2008) show that Applicant had the following delinquent \ndebts; a bank credit card account in collection for $185 (SOR 1.a); a store credit card \ncharged off for $450 (SOR 1.b); a credit card account charged off for $1,444 (SOR 1.c); \na major credit card account charged off for $3,232 (SOR 1.d); a store credit card \naccount past due for $137 on a balance of $997 (SOR 1.e); A store credit card past due \nfor $35 with a balance of $281 (SOR 1.f); two different store credit card accounts with \nthe same collection agency for $2,617 (SOR 1.g), and $655 (SOR 1.h); a bank credit \ncard in collection for $4,368 (SOR 1.i); a computer company credit account in collection \naccount for $2,192 (SOR 1.j); another bank credit card account in collection of $1,855 \n(SOR 1.k); four collection accounts with the same collection agency for three different \nstores for $700 (SOR 1.l), $2,812 (SOR 1.m), $1,671 (SOR 1.n), and $1,081 (SOR 1.o); \na loan account in collection for $1,912 (SOR 1.p) another loan collection account for \n\n \n4 \n \n \n$478 (SOR 1.q); a collection account for $139 (SOR 1.r); a collection account for $1,036 \n(SOR 1.s); a collection account for $2,374 (SOR 1.t); a collection account for $1,705 \n(SOR 1.u); a collection account for $198 (SOR 1.v); and a collection account for $61 \n(SOR 1.w).  \n \nApplicant submitted his security clearance application when starting employment \nwith his present employer in September 2008. He was interviewed by security agents in \nNovember 2008. He did not start to address his delinquent debts until April 2009. Until \nthat time, he stated he had to pay the rent on the apartment he left when he moved to \nhis new location and he had to lease a car. He was able to purchase a new car in \nJanuary 2009 lowering his car payments. In April 2009, he completed the apartment \nlease. He stated he now has sufficient funds to address his delinquent debts. He started \nworking with a debt management company and reached an agreement for them to \nassist him in May 2009. His first payment to them is due in July 2009. (Tr. 40-44; App. \nEx. E, agreement, dated May 13, 2009).  \n \nApplicant has attempted to reach a settlement with the creditors. He sent them \nletters dated April 15, 2009, copies of which are attached to the Response to the SOR, \noffering to settle at a set amount. While the letters are dated April 15, 2009, the certified \nmail receipts are postmarked May 7, 2009. The settlement offered is usually for 40% of \nthe debt. In some of the offers, it is for 40% of the credit limit on the credit card which is \nsignificantly less than the amount of the debt. He has not received a response from the \nfifteen creditors listed at SOR 1.a, 1.c, 1,e, 1.f, 1.g, 1.h, 1.j, 1.k, 1.m, 1.n, 1.o, 1.q, 1.s, \n1.t, and 1.u. (Tr. 46-47; See Response to SOR, dated April 26, 2009; App. Ex. A, \nUpdated Response, undated; App. Ex. G, Updated SOR response, dated June 25, \n2009).  \n \nApplicant reached a settlement for $225.07 with the store creditor for the $450 \ndebt at SOR 1.b. Payment is due no later than July 20, 2009 (App. Ex. G, Updated SOR \nresponse, dated June 25, 2009, attachment 6). \n \nThe payment of the credit card debt at SOR 1.d is included in Applicant's debt \nmanagement plan (App. Ex. E, debt management plan, dated May 13, 2009). The first \npayment under the plan was made on June 15, 2009 (App. Ex. G, Updated SOR \nResponse, dated June 25, 2009 at Attachment 1). \n \nThe debts listed at SOR 1.i and 1.p are the same debt. Applicant reached a \nsettlement of $1,912 with the collection agency for this debt. Applicant will make $40 \nmonthly payments until a total of $478 is paid. At that time, Applicant's account will be \nconsidered current. Applicant will receive a new credit account from the creditor with a \nbalance owed of $1,147.22, requiring him to make regular monthly payments. The first \ntwo $40 payments have been made (App. Ex. A, Updated SOR Response, dated April \n26, 2009, at attachments G-1, G-2, G-3, and G-4; App. Ex. G, Updated Response to \nSOR, dated June 25, 2009, at attachment 4). \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \nApplicant reached a settlement of $450.36 with the collection agency for the \n$700 collection account for a store at SOR 1.l. The first payment was made and the last \npayment is due on July 18, 2009 (App. Ex. A, Updated Response to SOR, dated April \n26, 2009, at attachments J-1; App. Ex. G, Updated Response to SOR, dated June 25, \n2009, at attachment 3). \n \nApplicant reached a settlement of $83.11 with the collection agency for the \n$138.50 collection account at SOR 1.r. The debt was paid in full (App. Ex. A, Updated \nResponse to SOR, dated April 26, 2009, at attachments O-2 and O-3; App. Ex. G, \nUpdated response to SOR, dated June 25, 2009, at attachment 5). \n \nApplicant disputed the $198 collection debt at SOR 1.v. stating he had no \ninformation on the debt (App. Ex. A, Updated response to SOR, dated April 26, 2009, at \nattachment T). The collection agency informed Applicant of the origin of the debt and \ncontact information for the original creditor (App. Ex. G, Updated Response to SOR, \ndated June 25, 2009, attachments 2a and 2b, dated May 12, 2009). Applicant has not \ntaken any action since receipt of this collection agency's response. \n \nApplicant reached a settlement of $24.40 with the collection agency for the $61 \ndebt at SOR 1.w. The settlement was paid (App. Ex. A, Updated Response to SOR, \ndated April 26, 2009 at Attachments T-1, T-2, T-3, and T-4). \n \nPolicies \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n \nAnalysis \n \nFinancial Considerations: \n \n \nUnder financial considerations, failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, \nsatisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of \njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified \ninformation. An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage \nin illegal acts to generate funds (AG \u00b6 18). Similarly, an individual who is financially \nirresponsible may also be irresponsible, unconcerned, or careless in their obligations to \nprotect classified information. Behaving responsibly or irresponsibly in one aspect of life \nprovides an indication of how a person may behave in other aspects of life.  \n \n \nA person\u2019s relationship with his creditors is a private matter until evidence is \nuncovered demonstrating an inability or unwillingness to repay debts under agreed \nterms. Absent evidence of strong extenuating or mitigating circumstances, an applicant \nwith a history of serious or recurring financial difficulties is in a situation of risk \ninconsistent with the holding of a security clearance. An applicant is not required to be \ndebt free, but is required to manage his finances in such a way as to meet his financial \nobligations. Applicant's delinquent debts as admitted by Applicant and listed on the \ncredit reports are a security concern raising financial considerations disqualifying \nconditions (FC DC) AG \u00b6 19(a) (inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts), FC DC AG \u00b6 \n19(c) (a history of not meeting financial obligations), and FC DC AG \u00b6 19(consistent \nspending beyond one's means, which may be indicated by excessive indebtedness, \nsignificant negative cash flow, high debt-to-income ration, and/or other financial \nanalysis). The debts were incurred when Applicant first received a good paying job in \n2003, and he opened store and credit card accounts to purchase items. Applicant was \nlaid off after opening the accounts, and was unable to meet his financial obligations. \nApplicant has only recently made inquiries about the accounts and paid some of them.  \n\n \n7 \n \n \nThere is a history of an inability to meet financial obligations since Applicant took no \naction concerning the delinquent debts for over four years. While Applicant thought he \nwas living within his means, he spent freely with his first paychecks incurring a lot of \ndebt on a number of credit cards and store credit accounts which shows his spending \nwas beyond his means.  \n \n \nI considered the financial considerations mitigating conditions (FC MC) raised by \nApplicant's testimony. FC MC AG \u00b6 20(a) (the behavior happened so long ago, was so \ninfrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does \nnot cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment) \nand it does not apply. Applicant's delinquent debts arose in 2005 and he took no action \nto even inquire about them until April 15, 2009. Almost all of the debts are unpaid, so \nthe debts are current. The debts are from various stores and credit cards, so he \nincurred debts frequently. Since the debts are not paid, they cast doubt on Applicant\u2019s \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment.  \n \n \nI considered FC MC AG \u00b6 20(b) (the conditions that resulted in the financial \nproblems were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a \nbusiness downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce, or separation) \nand the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances). Applicant started new \nemployment at a good salary and liberally incurred debt using store credit and credit \ncards believing his new job provided him the resources to pay the debts. He was laid off \ntwice, could not find good employment, and could not pay his debts. He moved back \nhome, lived with his parents, and found work at a small fraction of his previous salary. \nApplicant presented no information that he made any inquiries about or paid any of his \ndelinquent debts during this time. Applicant started a good paying position in his field in \nSeptember 2008. He was interviewed by security investigators in November 2008 and \nknew of the security concerns for his delinquent debts. He did not start to inquire about \nthe delinquent debts or make any payments on his debt until after he received the SOR. \nApplicant said he did not have funds to pay the debts until then. However, since he had \na good job at a good salary starting in September 2008, he could have at least \ncontacted the creditors to make arrangements to pay the debts when he had funds \navailable. He did not commence any actions on his delinquent debts until he realized \nthe debts were a security concern and affected his employment. He does not receive \ncredit under this mitigating condition since he did not act responsibly under the \ncircumstances.  \n \n \nI considered FC MC AG \u00b6 23(c) (the person has received or is receiving \ncounseling for the problem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or under control) and it does not apply. Applicant entered an agreement with a \ncredit management company to assist him with the management of his debts. He \nreceives credit counseling as part of the plan. However, he received replies to only a \nfew of the letters he sent to creditors, and resolved only a few of his debts.  His finances \nare not yet under control nor are his debts being resolved. \n \n\n \n8 \n \n \nI considered FC MC \u00b6 20(d) \"the individual has initiated a good-faith effort to \nrepay the overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts\". For FC MC \u00b6 20(d) to apply, \nthere must be an \u201cability\u201d to repay the debts, the \u201cdesire\u201d to repay, and \u201cevidence\u201d of a \ngood-faith effort to repay. A systematic, concrete method of handling debts is needed. \nThe applicant must establish a \"meaningful track record\" of debt payment. A \n\"meaningful track record\" of debt payment can be established by evidence of actual \ndebt payments or reduction of debt through payment of debts. An applicant is not \nrequired to establish that he paid off each debt listed. The entirety of an applicant\u2019s \nfinancial situation and his actions can reasonably be considered in evaluating the extent \nto which that applicant\u2019s plan for the reduction of his outstanding indebtedness is \ncredible and realistic. There is no requirement that a plan provide for payments on all \noutstanding debts simultaneously. Rather, a reasonable plan and concomitant conduct \nmay provide for the payment of such debts one at a time. All that is required is that the \napplicant demonstrated he has established a plan to resolve his financial problems and \ntaken significant actions to implement that plan.   \n \nApplicant has not established a good-faith effort to resolve his delinquent debts.  \nHe does not have a \"meaningful track record\" of debt payment. Applicant took no action \nto resolve his debt until after receipt of the SOR and his realization that his delinquent \ndebts affected his future employment with the defense contractor. He knew of the \nsecurity significance of his delinquent debt in November 2008 when interviewed by the \nsecurity investigator. He took no action at that time to even inquire of the creditors about \nthe debts. He only took action after receipt of the SOR. At that time, he entered a debt \nmanagement program and sent letters to creditors with settlement offers. He has been \nable to settle and pay only a limited number of his debts. The settlement offer letters, \nthe limited agreed settlements, and the limited debt payments, do not establish a \nmeaningful track record of debt payments and thereby a good-faith effort to resolve \ndebt. In addition, Applicant's promises to pay debts in the future do not rise to the level \nof a good-faith effort to resolve his debts. Applicant has not presented sufficient \ninformation to indicate a good-faith effort to pay creditors or resolve debts. His finances \nare not under control and he has not acted responsibly. He has not presented sufficient \ninformation to mitigate security concerns for financial considerations. \n \nWhole Person Analysis  \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s security eligibility by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all \nthe circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative \nprocess factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \n\n \n9 \n \n \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant a security clearance \nmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nguidelines and the whole person concept.  \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant opened credit accounts \nand incurred debt as soon as he had a good paying job. His debts became delinquent \nwhen he was laid off and could no longer meet his obligations. He was employed \nthereafter, albeit at a lower salary, but he made no effort to inquire about and resolve \nany of his delinquent debts. Even after gaining meaningful employment and a good \nsalary, he made no effort to inquire about or resolve his delinquent debts until he \nreceived the SOR and knew of the security clearance significance of his delinquent \ndebts. His lack of action shows he was irresponsible, unconcerned and careless about \nhis financial obligations. This leads to a determination that he may be untrustworthy, \nunreliable, exercise bad judgment, has poor self control, and unwilling to abide by rules \nand regulations. His financial irresponsibility indicates he may behave the same towards \nthe safeguarding of classified information. Overall, on balance the record evidence \nleaves me with questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a \nsecurity clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the \nsecurity concerns arising from financial considerations.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.e:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.f:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.g:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.h:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.i:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.j:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.k:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.l:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.m:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.n:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.o:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n\n \n10 \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.p:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.q:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.r:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.s:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.t:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.u:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.v:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.w:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.
