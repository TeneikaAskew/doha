Applicant requested a hearing. On April 8, \n2022, after the record closed, Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) Administrative \nJudge Mark Harvey denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance. Applicant appealed \npursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \nApplicant asserts that the Judge erred in his findings of fact, that the Judge was biased, and \nthat his delinquent debts have been mitigated by the passage of time, in that collection is now \nbarred by the statute of limitations.

He served on active duty for \nnine years and currently serves in the Reserve force. He has earned bachelor\u2019s and master\u2019s \ndegrees. The SOR alleged Applicant has three charged-off debts that total $44,471: \u00b6\u00b6 SOR 1.a. \n($3,136), 1.b. ($21,335), and 1.c. ($20,000). In responding to the SOR, Applicant admitted in part, \ndenied in part, and provided mitigation information.  \nFrom 2016 to 2022, Applicant and his wife had a gross annual income that averaged from \n$250,000 to $300,000. Several years ago, Applicant incurred $42,000 in medical and legal \nexpenses in adopting a child. Applicant\u2019s current annual salary is $135,000, he has an additional \nannual income of about $20,000, and his wife\u2019s annual salary is $155,000. Applicant has \nsubstantial funds in savings and estimated his net worth to be about $650,000. \nIn 2014, Applicant purchased a home for $189,000. Between 2014 and 2015, he spent \nabout $180,000 to expand the house from 1,400 square feet to 3,500 square feet. He contracted \nwith a construction company (CC) to renovate the residence for about $119,400. He had $80,000 \ncash, and he borrowed the remainder on credit cards. \nApplicant made the final payment to CC before the work was completed, and CC left \nwithout completing the job. Applicant was unable to recover the funds paid to CC, as the business \nclosed. Applicant acknowledged that he made a poor decision to pay the company prior to \ncompletion of the job. He subsequently paid other construction firms $57,000 to complete the \nconstruction. \nApplicant attempted unsuccessfully to have his insurance company pay for completion of \nconstruction or to recover the funds paid to CC. Applicant was unsure about why he chose not to \nsue CC, but cited as possible reasons an inability to collect from CC and a reluctance to pursue \nlitigation without reasonable hope of recovery. In 2021, Applicant sold the house and made a \nprofit of $130,000. \nIn October 2015, Applicant hired a debt reduction company (DRC) to help resolve five \ndelinquent debts, including the three alleged in the SOR.  \nIn 2015, the creditor in SOR \u00b6 1.c issued an IRS Form 1099-C canceling the debt owed by \nApplicant in the amount of about $18,000. Applicant declared the amount as income on his federal \nincome tax return.1 \nThe debt in SOR \u00b6 1.a. originated from a retail chain\u2019s charge card and the debt in SOR \u00b6 \n1.b. originated from a financial institution\u2019s credit card. DRC wrote the creditors for both debts, \nbut stated that the creditors did not respond, that the statute of limitations has now expired, and \nthat the creditors cannot legally collect the debts. DRC advised Applicant not to pay the two \ncreditors. Applicant did not provide the correspondence sent by DRC to the two creditors and did \nnot indicate that DRC ever offered a specific settlement amount to either creditor. He did not \n1 The Judge resolved this allegation (SOR \u00b6 1.c.) in favor of the Applicant. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nreceive an IRS Form 1099-C from either creditor. He had the funds available to pay the SOR \u00b6 \n1.b debt in full if he chose to do so. \nApplicant submitted a Feb 2022 credit report that does not reflect either the SOR \u00b6 1.a. or \nSOR \u00b6 1.b. debt. His December 2021 credit report reflects the SOR \u00b6 1.b. debt, but not the SOR \n\u00b61.a. debt. \nApplicant said the three-year statute of limitations barred collection of the \ndebts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b., and he believed the debt was \u201cno longer valid\u201d \n(internal citation omitted). The statute of limitations for a credit card debt in the \nstate where his residence was located in 2015 and 2016 is five years. Applicant did \nnot indicate the state with the three-year statute of limitations or provide \ninformation about why that state would have jurisdiction over his debts. [Decision \nat 4.] \nApplicant wanted DRC to convince his creditors to seek repayment from CC rather than \nfrom him. When the creditors elected not to do so, Applicant elected not to repay the creditors in \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. and 1.b.  \nTwo non-SOR creditors responded to DRC\u2019s request for information, and DRC settled both \ndebts on Applicant\u2019s behalf. One non-SOR creditor obtained a judgment against Applicant for \napproximately $9,800, which he satisfied with monthly payments. Aside from the two debts \nalleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a., and 1.b., Applicant has excellent credit.  \nJudge\u2019s Analysis: The Judge\u2019s analysis is summarized and quoted below, in pertinent \npart: \nApplicant described two circumstances beyond his control that adversely affected his \nfinances. First, he and his spouse adopted a child and spent $42,000 in medical and legal expenses.  \nSecond, he was the victim of an unscrupulous construction company when his home was under \nconstruction, which cost about $57,000 to remedy. However, Applicant did not act in a reasonable \nmanner in dealing with these circumstances. He did not file a lawsuit against CC. Having failed \nto establish privity between CC and the creditors, his dispute with CC did not provide a reasonable \nbasis for him not to pay his debts owed to the creditors in SOR 1.a. and 1.b.  \nApplicant did not provide documentary evidence that he maintained contact with the two \ncreditors, did not provide the letters that DRC sent to the creditors, and did not provide any \nevidence of any payments or settlement offers sent to these two creditors after 2015. \nThe two debts in issue do not appear on his February 2022 credit report. However, that is \nnot meaningful evidence of debt resolution, as there are multiple reasons why debts are dropped \nfrom credit reports. Federal law requires removal of most negative financial items from a credit \nreport seven years from the first date of delinquency or the debt becoming collection barred \nbecause of a state statute of limitations. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nDRC provided reasonable financial advice to Applicant about state statutes of limitation, \nwhich range from 2 to 15 years.  Although DRC said that the state statute of limitations was three \nyears, it was five years. Once Applicant stopped making payments, the creditor had to file suit \nwithin the statute of limitations to maintain the collectability of their debt. There is no evidence \nthat the creditors in issue took judicial action to pursue collection of these two debts. However, \nassuming Applicant\u2019s debts are collection barred, they are still relevant to the adjudication of \nApplicant\u2019s security clearance. Even if a delinquent debt is legally unenforceable under state law, \nthe Federal Government is entitled to consider the facts and circumstances surrounding an \napplicant\u2019s conduct in incurring the debt and failing to pay it in a timely manner. \nApplicant had ample financial resources over the last five years to resolve the debts \nin SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b. There is no clear evidence that these two debts are being \nresolved. I have assumed that Applicant could not be held financially responsible \nfor the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. and 1.b because of the statute of limitations. However, \nhe did not provide sufficient documentation about why he was unable to make \ngreater documented progress resolving these two debts. \n. \n. \n. \n[H]e did not provide a persuasive reason why he did not make specific and \nreasonable offers to settle the two debts. His lack of responsible financial action in \nregard to the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b over the last seven years raises \nunmitigated questions about his reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified information.  Decision at 10\u201311. \nDiscussion \nApplicant alleges that the Judge erred in two findings. First, he challenges the Judge\u2019s \ndetermination that the statute of limitations in his state of residence is five years, re-asserts that it \nis three, and alleges that this error contributed to the Judge\u2019s \u201cfundamental misunderstanding of \nthe legal actions taken with advice from lawyers . . . .\u201d Appeal Brief at 1. The Appeal Board \ndeclines to adjudicate the controlling statute of limitations on the debts in issue. As the Judge \nexplicitly stated, he assumed for purposes of the decision that the debts were in fact barred by the \nstatute of limitations, regardless of whether it was a three-year or five-year rule. We are not \npersuaded by Applicant\u2019s argument that the confusion over the controlling statute of limitations \ncould have in any way affected the Judge\u2019s assessment of mitigating factors or his whole person \nanalysis.   \nSecond, Applicant asserts that the Judge erred in characterizing the law firm that he \nretained as a \u201cdebt reduction company\u201d and that this label reflects a bias on the Judge\u2019s part. \nThis is another fundamental error in Judge Harvey\u2019s assessment of the \nsituation and suggests a prior opinion on debt resolution that affected his overall \nability to review and understand the actions taken. [The law firm] is a consumer \nlitigation law firm with experienced licensed attorneys familiar with the process of \nsettling debts. Judge Harvey clearly reviewed the case under the false \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                          \n \n \n \n \nunderstanding that we were trying to avoid paying our debts. To the contrary, we \nwere taking specific efforts, under legal counsel, to work with our creditors in order \nto pay the debts. This definition of [the law firm] as a \u201cDRC\u201d was presented not by \nthe government\u2019s representative, but by the Judge himself showing an extreme bias \n. . . . Facts were presented on the efforts to work with the creditors to satisfy the \ndebts but those were outright ignored because of Judge Harvey erroneously inserted \nthe label of \u201cDRC\u201d making evaluation of my judgement and intent predetermined \ndespite evidence presented.  [Appeal Brief at 2.] \nTurning first to the question of whether the Judge mischaracterized the firm that Applicant \nretained, we conclude that he did not.  Applicant testified to the various services that the law firm \nprovided to him, which included challenging the validity of debts, negotiating settlements, and \nproviding advice on the enforceability of the debts. Those services fall squarely within the generic \nunderstanding of the services provided by a debt relief or debt reduction company.2 The Judge \ncommitted no error, much less \u201cfundamental error,\u201d in referring to the law firm with this generic \ndescriptor.  \nTurning next to the question of bias\u2014there is a rebuttable presumption that a Judge is \nimpartial and unbiased, and a party seeking to overcome that presumption has a heavy burden of \npersuasion. See, e. g., ISCR Case No. 18-02722 at 5 (App. Bd. Jan. 30, 2020). The standard is \nnot whether Applicant personally believes the Judge was biased against him, but rather whether \nthe record contains any indication that the Judge acted in a manner that would lead a reasonable, \ndisinterested person to question his fairness and impartiality. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 20-02787 \nat 4 (App. Bd. Mar. 9, 2022). There is nothing in the record or in the Judge\u2019s decision that would \nlikely persuade a reasonable person that he lacked the requisite impartiality. Applicant has failed \nto carry his heavy burden of persuasion on this issue.      \nFinally, Applicant asserts that his debts are mitigated by the passage of time, as the statute \nof limitations has run and the debts are \u201cnot enforceable, therefore no security risk exists . . . .\u201d \nAppeal Brief at 4. In his decision, the Judge thoroughly explored the reasons why the statute of \nlimitations may bar recovery of the debt but does not bar a Judge from considering the underlying \ncircumstances of an applicant\u2019s financial difficulties and his response. The Judge\u2019s analysis and \nconclusions are firmly grounded in the extensive appeal board precedent to which he cites. It is \nwell established that the scope of Guideline F encompasses not only an Applicant\u2019s current \nfinancial situation, but also extends to his or her financial history. A Judge may consider debts \nthat are resolved, dropped from a credit report, or barred by the statute of limitations for what they \nmay reveal about an applicant\u2019s worthiness for a clearance. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 15-02957 at \n3 (App. Bd. Feb. 17, 2017). Applicant\u2019s brief discloses no reason to disturb the Judge\u2019s conclusion \nthat the evidence raises security concerns under Guideline F. \nApplicant has failed to establish the Judge committed any harmful error. None of \nApplicant\u2019s arguments are sufficient to rebut the presumption that the Judge considered all of the \nevidence in the record or to demonstrate that the Judge weighed the evidence in a manner that was \narbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 19-01495 at 3 (App. Bd. Sep. \n2 See, e.g., https://www.consumerfinance.gov/ask-cfpb/what-are-debt-settlementdebt-relief-services-and-should-i\u00ad\nuse-them-en-1457/. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n30, 2020).

Applicant requested a hearing. On July 19, \n2022, after close of the record, Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) Administrative \nJudge Pamela C. Benson denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant appealed \npursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. For reasons stated below, we affirm the decision. \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant has in-laws who are citizens and residents of Iraq. In \nresponding to the SOR, Applicant admitted both SOR allegations. At the hearing, Applicant \ntestified but offered no documentary evidence. In his appeal brief, he now provides a number of \ndocuments for the Appeal Board\u2019s consideration. The Board, however, is prohibited from \nconsidering new evidence on appeal. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.29 (\u201cNo new evidence shall be received \nor considered by the Appeal Board.\u201d). \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s brief does not specifically assert the Judge committed any error in the decision.  \nRather, it asserts that he knows other individuals who apparently hold clearances and have relatives \nin Iraq. In this regard, the Directive provides that each case must be judged on its own merits. See \nDirective, Encl. 2, App. A \u00b6 2(b). The fact that other individuals with relatives in Iraq may have \nbeen granted clearances does not establish the Judge erred in adjudicating Applicant\u2019s security \nclearance eligibility. \nApplicant also contends that the fact he has in-laws living in Iraq is not a sufficient reason \nto deny him a security clearance. As the Appeal Board has previously stated, \u201c[a]s a matter of \ncommon sense and human experience, there is a rebuttable presumption that a person has ties of \naffection for, or obligation to, the immediate family members of the persons\u2019 spouse.\u201d See, e.g., \nISCR Case No. 14-03112 at 3, n.1 (App. Bd. Nov. 3, 2015). It was not unreasonable for the Judge \nto conclude that security concerns arose from Applicant\u2019s in-laws Iraq. In short, none of \nApplicant\u2019s arguments are sufficient to show the Judge committed any harmful error in the \ndecision.  \nThe decision is sustainable on the record. \u201cThe general standard is that a clearance may be \ngranted only when \u2018clearly consistent with national security.\u2019\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).

He has submitted SCAs on several occasions and \nis familiar with the security clearance process. His testimony at the hearing was \nreplete with efforts to minimize and excuse his culpability for his debts and his \npersonal conduct. His claim that he was too tired and too sick to pay attention to \nthe questions in the SCA is not credible.\u201d [Decision at 11, citations omitted]. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.32.1 provides that the Appeal Board shall give deference to the Judge\u2019s credibility \ndeterminations. Based on our review of the record, we conclude that Applicant\u2019s Counsel failed \nto establish any basis for why we should not give such deference in this case and failed to prove \nthe Judge committed any error in concluding Applicant\u2019s SCA omissions were deliberate. We \nresolve this assignment of error adversely to Applicant. \nIn claiming that the Judge\u2019s analysis of the falsification allegation in SOR \u00b6 2.n is defective, \nApplicant\u2019s Counsel contends: \nIt is particularly relevant to note that the Judge found subparagraph 2.n \u201cAgainst \nApplicant\u201d for failure to disclose several traffic violations depicted in \nsubparagraphs 2.e through 2.k yet completely overlooked that fact that many of \nthese traffic violations had fines below $300 and were not reportable on the [SCA]. \n[Appeal Brief at 4.] \nThis argument, repeated multiple times in Counsel\u2019s brief in various contexts, lacks merit.  \nContrary to Counsel\u2019s claim, SOR \u00b6 2.n does not assert that Applicant failed to disclose the traffic \nviolations in \u201csubparagraphs 2.e through 2.k.\u201d Rather, it asserts that Applicant failed to disclose \nthe traffic infractions in \u201csubparagraphs 2.e and 2.k.\u201d In this regard, the Judge found: \nThe evidence reflects that he was fined $500 for the offense alleged in SOR \u00b6 2.e. \nHowever, the court records do not reflect the amount of the fine imposed for the \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n  \n \n \n  \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n  \n   \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \noffense alleged in SOR \u00b6 2.k, and Applicant testified that he was fined $250 for that \noffense. . . . I conclude that SOR \u00b6 2.n is partially established for the traffic offense \nalleged in SOR \u00b6 2.e but not for the traffic offense alleged in SOR \u00b6 2.k. [Decision \nat 6.] \nA review of the decision reveals no logical basis for asserting the Judge overlooked in his analysis \nof SOR \u00b6 2.n that the traffic infractions alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.f through 2.j resulted in fines imposed \nof less than $300.1 Those traffic infractions were not alleged in SOR \u00b6 2.n. From a plain reading \nof the decision, it is clear the Judge found against Applicant on SOR \u00b6 2.n for failing to disclose \nonly one traffic infraction (SOR \u00b6 2.e) that the SCA required him to report. This assertion of error \nis frivolous. \nApplicant\u2019s Counsel also claims: \nAlthough, the [Applicant] admitted to some of the debts depicted in the SOR, the \nevidence in the record shows that he settled the two (2) highest debts as described \nin the [SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b], a fact that was overlooked by the Administrative Judge \nin his analysis of the [Applicant\u2019s] financial plan forward and in fact determined \nthat those two allegations were \u201cAgainst Applicant\u201d for some reason, despite the \nresolution.  [Appeal Brief at 3-4.] \nThis claim is also baseless. In the findings of fact, the Judge noted that Applicant settled the debts \nin SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b. for less than the full balances in 2022. Decision at 3. In his analysis, the \nJudge stated: \nAG [Adjudicative Guideline] \u00b6 20(d)2 is established for the debts in SOR \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.d, 1.e, and 1.f, which have been resolved. It is not established for the debts \nalleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b, which Applicant did not resolve until he received \nthe SOR and realized that his security clearance was in jeopardy. Payment of debts \nunder pressure of obtaining and retaining a security clearance is not \u201cgood faith.\u201d \nAn applicant who waits until his clearance is in jeopardy before resolving debts \nmay be lacking in the judgment expected of those with access to classified \ninformation.  [Decision at 9-10, citations omitted.] \nWe find no basis in the decision for asserting the Judge overlooked the settlement of debts in SOR \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b as he specifically addressed those settlements in both his findings and conclusions. \nAgain, it is evident from a plain reading of the Judge\u2019s decision that this assignment of error is \nfrivolous.  \n1 The Judge noted that the traffic infraction alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.m resulted in a fine of more than $300, but, because \nthat infraction was not alleged in the SOR, it could not be considered as a basis for revoking Applicant\u2019s security \nclearance. \n2 See Directive, Encl. 2, App. A \u00b6 20(d), the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay overdue \ncreditors or otherwise resolve debts[.] \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s Counsel further contends that the Judge erred in his analysis by failing to \nconsider all of the record evidence and by misapplying the mitigating conditions and whole-person \nconcept. These arguments fail to raise any material issue that the Board needs to specifically \naddress. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32. In general, Counsel\u2019s arguments are neither sufficient to rebut \nthe presumption that the Judge considered all of the evidence in the record nor enough to show \nthat the Judge weighed the evidence in a manner that was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  \nAdditionally, the Judge complied with the requirements of the Directive in his whole-person \nanalysis by considering the totality of the evidence in reaching his decision.  See, e.g., ISCR Case \nNo. 19-01400 at 2 (App. Bd. Jun. 3, 2020). Although we give due consideration to the Hearing \nOffice decisions that Applicant has cited, they are not binding precedent on the Appeal Board, \ndistinguishable from the present case, and insufficient to undermine the Judge\u2019s decision.

The Judge concluded that Applicant has a lengthy history of financial issues and that he failed \nto establish he acted responsibly in addressing his financial problems.   \nIn his appeal brief, Applicant claims the Judge erred in the History of the Case by stating \nhe submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on October 16, 2018.

He was \nemployed by a defense contractor at the time (his current employer) whether or not \nhe held a clearance at the time, or had actual access to classified information. \nRegardless, he should have known better.

There is no need to address this argument because, as noted above, the Judge \nconcluded Disqualifying Condition 25(f) was not established. From a plain reading of the \ndecision, it is apparent the Judge disregarded the phrase \u201cwhile granted access to classified \ninformation\u201d in finding against Applicant on the drug use allegations.  \nApplicant contends that the Judge did not accurately apply the whole-person concept and \nmischaracterized his trustworthiness.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel \nFOR APPLICANT \nAlan V. Edmunds, Esq. \nThe Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance. On \nJuly 15, 2021, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis of that \ndecision\u2e3asecurity concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) and Guideline E \n(Personal Conduct) of DoD Directive 5220.6 (January 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive). Applicant \nrequested a decision on the written record. On February 25, 2022, after the record closed, Defense \nOffice of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) Administrative Judge Noreen A. Lynch denied \nApplicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 \nand E3.1.30. \nUnder Guideline F, the Judge found against Applicant on five allegations of financial \nconcern and found favorably on six. Additionally, the Judge found favorably for Applicant on the \nGuideline E allegations. The favorable findings are not in issue on appeal. The Applicant raised \nthe following issues on appeal: whether the Judge failed to consider all the evidence, whether the \nJudge failed to apply the mitigating conditions, and whether her adverse decision was arbitrary, \ncapricious, or contrary to law.  Consistent with the following, we affirm. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAs a preliminary matter, we note that the Judge failed to make a formal finding regarding \nSOR \u00b6 1.h. This apparent oversight has not been raised as an issue on appeal. We simply point \nout that judges are required to address all of the allegations in a SOR. Executive Order 10865 \u00a7 3 \n(7); Directive \u00b6 E3.1.25. \nThe Judge\u2019s Findings of Fact: The Judge\u2019s pertinent findings are summarized and quoted \nbelow: \nApplicant is in his late forties. He served in the military from 1991 through 2011. He has \nbeen consistently employed since 2011 and has been with his current employer since 2016. \nMarried with three children, Applicant is separated from his wife and lives with his girlfriend.  \nThe SOR lists a court judgment and 11 financial delinquencies totaling about $139,200. In \nhis Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted to the judgment and eight of the delinquent debts. He \nstated that some accounts are duplicates, that he is making payments on several accounts, and that \nhe hired a debt management company to assist him in resolving his debts. His most recent credit \nreport in September 2021 indicates nine delinquent accounts that total approximately $70,920. \nAs to SOR 1.a., in the amount of $4,728 for a 2019 judgment, Applicant \nadmitted that he believed it had been paid. He submitted a document from the debt \nmanagement company showing he settled the debt for $1,575 on June 14, 2021. \nAs to SOR 1.b, in the amount of $34,420 for a collection account, Applicant \nadmitted and claimed that he pays $600 a month on the account. He did not provide \nany documentation. Applicant\u2019s 2021 credit report reflect the debt as charged off. \nAs to SOR 1.c, in the amount of $13,500 for a charged-off account \nApplicant stated that he pays $300 a month with a direct withdrawal. He did not \nprovide any documentation. \nAs to SOR 1.d, in the amount of $8,505 for a charged-off account, the \naccount is with the debt management company. Applicant intends to pay this bill \nin the future. \nAs to SOR 1.e, in the amount of $6,527 for a charged-off account, he denied \nbecause it had been paid in June 2021. \nAs to SOR 1.f, in the amount of $3,946, for a charged-off account, he \nadmitted and stated that this account is with the debt management company. The \naccount is reflected on his 2021 credit bureau report as charged off. \nAs to SOR 1.g, in the amount of $2,339 for a charged-off account, Applicant \ndenied because it is a duplicate of the account in SOR to the same creditor. He is \npaying on this account monthly. This account 1.h does appear to be a duplicate. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n                                                          \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAs to SOR 1.i, in the amount of $12,477, for a charged-off account. \nApplicant admitted and stated that this account is with the debt management group. \nAs to SOR 1.j in the amount of $5,747, Applicant believed it was paid \nthrough the debt management company. It is reflected on the latest credit bureau \nreport with a zero balance. \nAs to SOR 1.k, in the amount of $38,795, Applicant denied this account and \nstated it was a duplicate of SOR 1.b. This appears to be accurate because the latest \ncredit report shows it was transferred to another account and had a zero balance. \nAs to SOR 1.l, for a mortgage account that is past-due in the amount of \n$6,255, with a total balance of $194,327, Applicant admitted that he is working \nwith the bank currently processing paper work again. He stated that he had a \npayment that was late in June. He did not provide the year in his answer. \nApplicant submitted documents from the debt management company that \nshowed he has paid money to them since at least 2016. The documents do not \nidentify which accounts received the money.  [Decision at 2-3.] \nApplicant\u2019s interview for his clearance revealed that his financial problems began in 2016 \nafter his spouse lost income, reducing the overall family income by approximately $40,000. \nSupporting two households, Applicant used credit cards to supplement the income. Applicant \nstated that he was na\u00efve regarding finances and allowed balances to accrue. When he attempted to \nnegotiate, most creditors refused. He entered into an agreement with his debt management \ncompany and pays them $700 monthly, with a $500 service fee. For his subject interview, \nApplicant listed the debts that are now with his debt consolidation firm, but it is not clear from the \nrecord which accounts have been settled or paid. \nApplicant\u2019s net monthly salary is $4,480, his military retirement is $600, his VA disability \npayment is $3,492, and his co-habitant\u2019s net monthly income is $1,000, for a total of $9,572.  \nThe Judge\u2019s Analysis: The Judge\u2019s analysis is quoted below, in pertinent part. \nAG \u00b6 20(a)1 is partially established. Applicant and his wife separated in \n2016 and he lost $40,000 of family income. He does not live with her and will get \ndivorced.  . . . \nAG \u00b6 20(b)2 is not fully established. While Applicant\u2019s separation was a \ncondition beyond his control, he has not acted responsibly to address the resulting \ndebt. \n1 AG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. \nDirective, Encl. 2, App. A. \n2 AG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss \nof employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n                                                          \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c)3 and 20(d)4 are established. Applicant responded to the SOR \nand provided documentation of obtaining the services of a debt consolidation \ncompany. The documentation did not show all the accounts that were in the plan, \nbut his debt has been reduced to $70,920. While this is not an insubstantial amount \nof money, he is gainfully employed and has been paying his creditors. He has taken \ncredit counseling. \nApplicant failed to meet his burden to mitigate the financial concerns set \nout in the SOR for lack of sufficient evidence and documentation. For these reasons, \nI find he has not fully mitigated the security concerns under the financial \nconsiderations guideline. [Decision at 7.] \nDiscussion \nApplicant has not challenged any of the Judge\u2019s specific findings of fact. Rather, he first \ncontends that the Judge erred by not considering all of the available evidence. In this regard, \nApplicant\u2019s counsel failed to comply with a fundamental requirement of the directive\u2014\u201cThe \nappeal brief must . . . cite specific portions of the case record supporting any alleged error.\u201d \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.30. Our review confirms that the evidence Applicant recites is included and fully \nconsidered in the Judge\u2019s decision.  Applicant has failed to carry his burden in that he has cited to \nno specific evidence ignored or overlooked by the Judge. \nSecondly, Applicant contends that the Judge failed to apply the mitigating conditions \nproperly, resulting in an arbitrary and capricious decision.  In particular, Applicant highlights that \nthe Judge found that the Applicant established two mitigating conditions\u2014AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(c) and 20(d) \n\u2014 but nevertheless denied the clearance. \nWe note first that there is a paucity of evidence in the record to support the Judge\u2019s \nconclusion that AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(c) and 20(d) are established. Using the Government\u2019s most recent credit \nreport (Item 4), the Judge calculated that Applicant\u2019s debt was reduced from the $139,200 alleged \nin the SOR to approximately $70,920. Decision at 2. However, our review of Item 4 establishes \ndelinquent debt of approximately $97,700.5 Moreover, the most significant reduction in debt is \nsimply a function of the Judge removing a duplicative SOR debt of approximately $38,700 (SOR \n1.k.). Decision at 3. Both in his clearance interview and in his response to the SOR, Applicant \nasserted that he retained a law firm in 2016 to manage his debt and that he was paying off his debts \nthrough that firm. With his response to the SOR, Applicant submitted documents indicating that \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the individual acted responsibly under the \ncircumstances. Directive, Encl. 2, App. A. \n3 AG \u00b6 20(c): the person has received or is receiving financial counseling for the problem from a legitimate and \ncredible source, such as a non-profit credit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control. Directive, Encl. 2, App. A. \n4 AG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise \nresolve debts. Directive, Encl. 2, App. A. \n5 This figure includes a delinquent debt of about $12,300 that was not alleged on the SOR.

The record before us does not confirm that there are \u201cclear indications that \nthe problem is being resolved or is under control,\u201d as required by AG \u00b6 20(c), or that Applicant is \n\u201cadhering to a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts,\u201d as required \nby AG \u00b6 20(d). Because we are not persuaded that AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(c) and 20(d) are established, we are \nlikewise not persuaded by Applicant\u2019s argument that mitigation under these two paragraphs should \nnecessarily result in a grant of a clearance. \nA Judge\u2019s decision must be written in a manner that allows the parties and the Board to \ndiscern what findings the Judge is making and what conclusions he or she is reaching. See, e.g., \nISCR Case No. 18-00695 at 3 (App. Bd. Sep. 20, 2019). The Judge\u2019s decision in this case creates \nconfusion in at least three regards. First, as noted above, she miscalculated the debt reflected on \nthe most recent credit report and, consequently, credited Applicant with making more inroads on \nhis debt than the record supports. Second, the Judge determined in her findings of fact that the \ndebts alleged at SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b., 1.c., and 1.i., totaling approximately $60,400, were charged off and \nthat there was no documentation of any payments. Without further discussion or explanation, the \nJudge found favorably for Applicant on those same debts in her Formal Findings. Third, the Judge \nmis-read Applicant\u2019s clearance interview (Item 10) and attributed the loss of $40,000 in income to \nhis wife and their separation, when in fact it was Applicant\u2019s girlfriend who lost income in 2016, \nafter Applicant had separated from his spouse. The Judge cited to this erroneous fact in her \nanalysis under AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a) and 20(b), and Applicant\u2019s counsel predicated portions of his appeal \nbrief on this erroneous finding. \nThe Judge\u2019s apparent errors were favorable to Applicant. However, she ultimately \nconcluded that Applicant failed to submit sufficient evidence and documentation and thus failed \nto fully mitigate. Consequently, any errors appear harmless, as they likely would not have altered \nthe Judge\u2019s final decision. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 10-01021 at 3 (App. Bd. Nov. 18, 2011). Said \ndifferently, if the Judge calculated Applicant\u2019s current delinquent debt to be $97,700 and not \n$70,900 or if she found against him on additional debts, it\u2019s not likely that she would change her \nadverse decision to a favorable one. Given these circumstances, we conclude that no benefit would \nbe gained by remanding the decision to the Judge to clarify and correct the record. See, e.g., ISCR \nCase No. 18-00695 at 3. \nThe Judge\u2019s key conclusion\u2014that Applicant failed to meet his burden to mitigate the \nfinancial concerns set out in the SOR for lack of sufficient evidence and documentation\u2014is \nsustainable on the record. Our review confirms that there is very little documentation to \ncorroborate Applicant\u2019s claims that he has been making consistent payments through his law firm \nand scant evidence that his financial problems are under control. \nNone of Applicant\u2019s arguments are enough to rebut the presumption that the Judge \nconsidered all of the record evidence or to demonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence in a manner \nthat was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 19-01400 at 2 (App. \nBd. Jun. 3, 2020). Although we give due consideration to the Hearing Office cases that Applicant\u2019s \ncounsel has cited, they are neither binding precedent on the Appeal Board nor sufficient to \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nundermine the Judge\u2019s decision.

The Judge examined the relevant evidence and articulated \na satisfactory explanation for the decision. \u201cThe general standard is that a clearance may be \ngranted only when \u2018clearly consistent with national security.\u2019\u201d Department of the Navy v.

Applicant appealed \npursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s adverse decision is \narbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law because he overlooked evidence.

In \nresponding to the SOR, he admitted 13 of the alleged debts and denied the others. The Judge found \nin favor of Applicant on one allegation and against him on the others. \nStudent loans constitute the bulk of Applicant\u2019s alleged indebtedness. \nThe school \nApplicant attended has closed, and students are suing the school to recoup their tuition. Applicant \nsubmitted the first of five pages of a student loan discharge application but acknowledged in that \ndocument that he was not eligible for a discharge because he completed his educational program \nbefore the school closed.  He indicated a loan advisor told him to submit the application so that he \nmight be eligible for recoupment if the lawsuit is successful, and he further indicated he would pay \nthe loans if the lawsuit was unsuccessful. The Judge considered this promise to pay in future as \nfalling short of meaningful evidence of mitigation. In the decision, the Judge also noted that \nApplicant claimed various debts were resolved, but he failed to present documentation showing \nthe debts were paid or otherwise were in the process of being resolved. None of the Applicant\u2019s \narguments in his appeal brief are enough to rebut the presumption the Judge considered all of the \nrecord evidence or to demonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence in a manner that was arbitrary, \ncapricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 19-01939 at 4 (App. Bd. May 11, 2022). \nApplicant failed to establish the Judge committed any harmful error.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel \nFOR APPLICANT \nAlan V. Edmunds, Esq. \nThe Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance. On \nSeptember 3, 2021, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis of \nthat decision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of DoD \nDirective 5220.6 (January 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive). Applicant requested a decision on \nthe written record. On August 18, 2022, after consideration of the record, Defense Office of \nHearings and Appeals (DOHA) Administrative Judge Paul J. Mason denied Applicant\u2019s request \nfor a security clearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \nThe SOR alleged nine delinquent debts. The Judge found favorably for Applicant on one \nand adversely on the other eight, which total about $53,000. Applicant raises the following issue \non appeal\u2014whether the Judge\u2019s adverse decision was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. \nConsistent with the following, we affirm. \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \nThe Judge\u2019s Findings of Fact and Analysis \nApplicant is in his forties. Divorced in 2016, Applicant has two children. He has been \ncontinuously employed from 2007 to the present. Applicant attributes his debts to several factors: \nhis divorce, providing financial assistance to family members, and taking care of his parents after \nthey fell ill. Applicant asserted that financial advisors recommended that he focus on paying \ncurrent debts and allow his old debts to be charged off. \nIn his June 2020 clearance interview, Applicant explained that he and his ex-spouse agreed \nduring their divorce proceedings to pay off some of their bills. He stated that he paid off some \ndebts but was waiting for the statute of limitations (SOL) to run on others. Applicant also \nexpressed his intent to write creditors and work out repayment plans. He is current on all present \nbills.  \nAt the time of his security clearance interview, Applicant had approximately $4,500 in \ndiscretionary income every month after subtracting monthly expenses from net earnings. \nApplicant did not provide documents to establish how much financial support he provided for his \nparents or family members. At his interview, he was afforded an opportunity to provide additional \ndocuments related to the delinquent debts but declined to do so.  \nFollowing his 2016 divorce, Applicant accrued about $53,000 in delinquent debt between \n2017 and 2020. There is some evidence that events beyond his control\u2014to include his divorce, \nhis parents\u2019 illness, and his assistance to other family members\u2014caused the indebtedness.  \nHowever, in the absence of documentation of these events, it is impossible to speculate as to their \nfinancial impact.  \nThe reason why his debts are not being resolved or under control is due to his \nreliance on advice of financial advisors, persuading him to wait for the pertinent \nstatute of limitations to run out so that the delinquent debts would no longer be \nenforceable. Under DOHA security clearance law, that decision to rely on the \ntolling of the statute rather than pay his debts, does not demonstrate a good-faith \neffort to pay off his debt obligations.  [Decision at 7.] \nDiscussion \nIn his brief, Applicant states, \u201cHe was advised by security personnel that a decision on the \nwritten record would provide a faster result.\u201d Appeal Brief at 4. He cites to no evidence in the \nrecord that corroborates that statement. To the extent that he is contending the purported statement \nby unidentified security personnel may have misled him in making a forum choice, he has failed \nto establish a prima facie case of a due process violation.  \nApplicant has not challenged any of the Judge\u2019s specific findings of fact. To the extent \nthat we understand Applicant\u2019s argument, it is that the Judge failed to consider the actions he has \ntaken to rectify his debts, which included retaining a credit repair firm and following their advice \nto \u201c[wait] for the debts to fall off his credit report.\u201d Appeal Brief at 6. Applicant notes that the \nAppeal Board has stated that reliance on a SOL is not a good-faith effort within the meaning of \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                          \n \n  \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n   \nAdjudicative Guideline (AG) \u00b6 20(d),1 but he argues that the Judge erred in that he applied this \nprecedent too broadly and failed to consider whether this same conduct might in fact be mitigating \nunder other subparagraphs.2 \nFor example, \u201cApplicant followed the advice of a financial \nprofessional to wait until his debts were charged-off which shows applicability under [AG \u00b6 \n20(c)].\u201d3 Appeal Brief at 7. \nThe Board is not persuaded. Putting aside whether the advice not to pay the debts came \nfrom \u201ca legitimate and credible source\u201d within the meaning of the Guidelines, AG \u00b6 20(c) requires \n\u201cclear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control,\u201d and there are no such \nindications here. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 07-09304 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 6, 2008). We conclude \nthis assignment of error lacks merit. None of Applicant\u2019s arguments are enough to rebut the \npresumption that the Judge considered all of the record evidence or to demonstrate the Judge \nweighed the evidence in a manner that was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. Moreover, \nthe Judge complied with the requirements of the Directive in his whole-person analysis by \nconsidering all evidence of record in reaching his decision.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel \nFOR APPLICANT \nPro se \nThe Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance. On \nJune 14, 2021, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for that \ndecision\u2015security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of DoD Directive \n5220.6 (January 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant initially requested a decision on the \nwritten record but subsequently elected a hearing. On September 19, 2022, after the hearing, \nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) Administrative Judge John Bayard Glendon \ndenied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance. Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 \nE3.1.28 and E3.1.30. For reasons stated below, we affirm the decision. \nThe SOR alleged eight charged-off debts or debts in collection totaling about $36,000. In \nhis answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted all of the allegations with explanations. The Judge \nfound against Applicant on all allegations.  \n\n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe Judge\u2019s Findings of Fact and Analysis \nApplicant\u2019s business failed in 2015 or 2016, causing the eight defaults on credit cards and \na loan that are alleged in the SOR. His marriage failed at the same time. Applicant filed for \ndivorce and assumed custody of his two minor children. In his mid-fifties at the time, Applicant \nexperienced a period of unemployment or underemployment before beginning work in July 2018 \nas a linguist for a U.S. Government contractor. Applicant submitted letters and a certificate of \nappreciation that attest to his performance as a linguist and his work ethic. \nThe record shows that Applicant has not responsibly managed his \nsubstantial debts resulting from his business failure and subsequent unemployment. \nNone of the debts alleged in the SOR have been resolved. His financial problems \nbegan with his business failure in 2015 or 2016, and his divorce in 2016. He also \nhad a period of underemployment or unemployment in the following year or two. \nHowever, his lack of action to resolve the SOR debts since then does not show \nresponsible conduct on his part. He began earning an income in 2018 as a linguist \nand has been working overseas for most of the past four years without taking \nresponsibility for his debts. None of the mitigating conditions wholly apply to the \nfacts of this case.  \n. \n. \n. \nI have given significant weight to Applicant\u2019s service to the U.S. Government as a \nlinguist, and the sacrifices and dangers that his work requires. His evidence in \nmitigation, however, does not outweigh the security-significant failure by \nApplicant to address and resolve his debts from a number of years ago. He let his \ndebts become unenforceable due to their age without making payment \narrangements to resolve them. Overall, the record evidence leaves me with \nquestions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s present suitability for national security \neligibility and a security clearance.  [Decision at 7\u20138.] \nDiscussion \nThere is no presumption of error below, and the appealing party has the burden of raising \nand demonstrating factual or legal error by the Judge. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 19-01689 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Jun. 8, 2020). In this case, Applicant has failed to meet that burden. \nApplicant asserts that his credit cards went into default between 2014 and 2015, that he \nhad no means to pay the debts until he secured employment in 2018, that he then deployed to a \ncombat zone and was unable to contact creditors, and that the statute of limitations had run by the \ntime he returned to the United States in March 2019. The evidence of record, in particular \nApplicant\u2019s testimony, supports the Judge\u2019s conclusion that Applicant failed to take responsibility \nfor his debts once he secured employment in June 2018. \nApplicant testified that\u2015once \nemployed\u2015he contacted the creditors, who either wanted payment in full or advised him that the \naccounts were charged-off and that the statute of limitations would run. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nJudge: So, at that point [2018], the debts were not charged off. They were \nnot uncollectable because it had only been a couple of years since they were in \ndefault. So, you\u2019re saying you took no action when you became employed? \nApplicant: That\u2019s correct. Tr. at 51 \u2013 52. \nThe Appeal Board has long recognized that debts remain relevant for security clearance \npurposes even if they are no longer enforceable due to the running of the statute of limitations.  \nThat is, a judge may consider the underlying circumstances of these uncollectable debts in \nevaluating whether an applicant demonstrated good judgment, trustworthiness, and reliability. We \nnote that all eight debts alleged on the SOR remain unpaid. The record supports the Judge\u2019s \nconclusion that Applicant did not act responsibly under the circumstances. See, e.g., ISCR Case \nNo. 20-01618 at 3\u20134 (App. Bd. Sep. 29, 2022). \nThe remainder of Applicant\u2019s brief is largely an argument that the Judge failed to apply the \nmitigating conditions properly. For example, Applicant highlights that his debts are mitigated by \nthe passage of time: \u201cThe financial issues in my past are just that\u2015in my past.\u201d Appeal Brief at \n2. However, an applicant\u2019s ongoing, unpaid debts evidence a continuing course of conduct and, \ntherefore, can be viewed as recent for purposes of the Guideline F mitigating conditions. See, e.g., \nISCR Case No. 17-03146 at 2 (App. Bd. Jul. 31, 2018). \nAdditionally, Applicant provides new information on appeal, to include details about his \nemployment history since 2018 that are not elsewhere in the record. The Appeal Board does not \nreview cases de novo and is prohibited from considering new evidence on appeal. Directive \nE3.1.29. \nApplicant has failed to establish that the Judge committed any harmful error or that he \nshould be granted any relief on appeal.

See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-02563 at 4 (App. Bd. Aug. 28, 2015). \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant had eight delinquent Department of Education (DOE) \nstudent loans totaling about $98,000. Applicant has other student loans that are neither alleged \nnor delinquent.  The Judge found against Applicant on each of the alleged student loans.  \nApplicant began his college education in about late 2003. He received a bachelor\u2019s degree \nin 2008 and post-graduate degrees in 2010 and late 2016. The Judge noted Applicant\u2019s student \nloan history is confusing.  We agree.  This confusion appears to arise from several sources.  First, \nApplicant mistakenly believed for several years that the alleged student loans were consolidated \nwith his non-alleged student loans and that his student loan payments were servicing all of them. \nSecond, the COVID student loan relief measures affected both his alleged and non-alleged student \nloans, and the manner in which credit reports reflect the status of those loans is confusing. Finally, \nApplicant submitted post-hearing documents that he believed reflected payments towards his \nstudent loans, but instead they were going to a commercial entity advocating on his behalf for \nstudent loan forgiveness or relief. \nIn the decision, the Judge concluded, \u201c[o]ver an 18-year period, there is little to no evidence \nreflecting that he met his payment obligations on those loans.\u201d  Decision at 6.   This conclusion is \nnot sustainable based upon the following drawn from the Judge\u2019s decision, the record, and Federal \nGovernment websites: \n1. In responding to the SOR, Applicant denied the alleged student loans, stating they were \nin deferment. SOR Response at 2. Consequently, the burden was on Department Counsel to prove \nalleged facts that were controverted.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14. \n2. The Government\u2019s evidence does not reflect exactly when Applicant\u2019s alleged student \nloans first became delinquent. \n3. Applicant claimed his student loans were deferred while he was on military orders. \nGovernment Exhibit (GE) 2 at 3; Tr. at 22. His security clearance application reflects that he was \non military orders from September 2010 to September 2017. GE 1 at 17. Student loans may be \ndeferred during certain periods of active duty and immediately following such service. See https:// \nstudentaid.gov/site/default/files/military-student-loan-benefts.pdf. \nNo evidence contradicts \nApplicant\u2019s assertion that the loans were deferred during his military service. \n4. Applicant testified that every time he entered a new educational program, he did not \nhave to make any student loan payments. Tr. at 30. He received his last advanced degree in \nDecember 2016.

The history of Applicant\u2019s enrollment status is unknown. \n5. During his background interview, Applicant provided two IRS letters dated February \n20, 2020, reflecting payments to him were applied to a DOE debt. GE 2 at 4, 34, and 35. It is \nunknown to which student loans these withholdings were applied.  \n6. During the COVID-19 pandemic, payments on Federal student loans were deferred from \nMarch 13, 2020, until at least December 31, 2022. \nSee https://crsreports.congress.gov/ \nproduct/pdf/R/R46314/14 at 11.  \n7. Credit reports reflect the alleged student loans were first reported in collection in \nSeptember 2020 (GE 3 at 17-19), which was during the COVID-19 deferment. \n8. In November 2020, Applicant applied for the DOE consolidated loan program (GE 2 at \n17), loan forbearance program (GE 2 at 19-20), and loan rehabilitation program (GE 2 at 24-25). \nAll of those actions took place before the issuance of the SOR in July 2021. \n9. The alleged student loans were rehabilitated in September 2021 (attachment to SOR \nResponse).  \n10. Applicant\u2019s latest credit reports (GE 5 and 6) reflect the alleged student loans (now \nconsolidated into four loans) are in good standing, showing payments from August 2021 to \nFebruary 2022 (GE 5 and 6).  \nThe Government has not established how long the alleged student loans were delinquent \nbefore they were deferred during the pandemic. The length of time a debt is delinquent is a factor \nto consider in assessing the security concerns arising from that debt. See generally, ISCR Case \nNo. 20-01527 at 2 (App. Bd. Jun. 7, 2021); ISCR Case No. 20-03208 at 2 (App. Bd. July 6, 2021); \nand ISCR Case No. 20-02219 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 28, 2021), affirming unfavorable clearance \ndecisions involving student loans deferred during the COVID-19 pandemic because those loans \nwere delinquent for significant periods before that deferment became effective. In this case, the \nrecord only supports that the alleged student loans were delinquent for less than a month (between \nFebruary and March 2020) before the pandemic deferment went into effect and that Applicant took \nsignificant action starting in about November 2020 to bring them into a good standing while they \nremained deferred. This proven delinquency is minor. The Judge\u2019s decision is reversed because \nit fails to consider important aspects of the case and runs contrary to the record evidence. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nOrder \nThe decision is REVERSED. \nSigned: James F.

Consistent with the following, we affirm. \nThe Judge\u2019s Findings of Fact and Analysis \nIn her early 30s, Applicant is a single mother of three.

She has worked for her current employer since 2020 and has never held a \nsecurity clearance. \nApplicant\u2019s SOR alleges numerous delinquent debts, including two student loans totaling \nover $30,500. It also alleges delinquent consumer debts and numerous delinquent medical debts.  \nApplicant admitted the SOR allegations, which are also established by the record evidence. \nApplicant attributed her financial problems to her unemployment, diminished income, various \nmedical issues, moving costs, and being a single mother. She acknowledged during her clearance \ninterview that she had resolved several smaller financial obligations and planned to resolve the \nremaining ones by negotiating with creditors and through debt consolidation. The Judge found \nthat Applicant was making payments on some of her medical debts. Applicant received credit \ncounseling, has maintained a budget, has no other delinquent debts as of the date of the hearing, \nand expects a substantial refund from her income tax return that she will use to resolve her financial \nproblems. \nThe Judge noted circumstances outside Applicant\u2019s control that affected her financial \ndifficulties and resolved some of the medical debts in her favor. She also favorably resolved two \nallegations that were duplicates of two others. However, for the bulk of the allegations, including \nthe student loans, the Judge concluded that Applicant had not demonstrated responsible action or \ngood-faith efforts to pay her debts. The Judge stated that Applicant\u2019s finances are not under control \nand that her financial concerns continue to cast doubt upon her judgment, trustworthiness, and \nreliability. \nDiscussion \nApplicant states that she was not prepared for the hearing. To the extent that she is \ncontending that she was in some way denied due process, we note that along with the SOR \nApplicant received a copy of the Directive, which describes the hearing procedures in detail and \nsets forth an applicant\u2019s rights and obligations regarding the presentation of mitigating evidence. \nShe also received a memorandum from Department Counsel that advised her of her right to an \nattorney, her opportunity to submit evidence and witnesses, and to testify in her own behalf.  \nHearing Exhibit I, Department Counsel Memorandum, dated July 13, 2021. At the beginning of \nthe hearing the Judge explained in detail the procedures that would be employed, and she gave \nApplicant a month afterward to submit additional evidence, although Applicant ultimately \npresented none. Tr. at 62; Decision at 2. Although Applicant may not be satisfied with the \noutcome of her case, any defects in her presentation cannot be attributed to failure by DOHA to \nprovide her with appropriate notice and guidance. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 15-04472 at 3 (App. \nBd. Feb. 9, 2017). Although pro se applicants are not held to the standard expected of attorneys, \nthey are expected to take reasonable steps to preserve and exercise their rights. See, e.g., ISCR \nCase No. 18-02689 at 2 (App. Bd. Jul. 26, 2019). We resolve this issue adversely to Applicant. \nApplicant contends that the Judge \u201cdidn\u2019t take into account [all of] the delinquent accounts \n[that were] paid off before the hearing as well as the accounts that were brought to . . . current \nstatus.\u201d Appeal Brief at 1. However, the Judge\u2019s findings about the status of Applicant\u2019s SOR \ndebts are consistent with the record that was before her, and she specifically found that Applicant \nhas no additional debts.

On \nJune 23, 2021, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for that \ndecision\u2e3asecurity concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of Department \nof Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive). Applicant requested a hearing.  \nOn December 7, 2021, after the hearing, Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) \nAdministrative Judge Darlene D. Lokey Anderson denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security \nclearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \nApplicant raised the following issues: whether the Judge was biased against Applicant and \nwhether the Judge\u2019s adverse decision was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.

One of them was \nthe subject of a garnishment action. \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems were related to a job termination in 2018 due to excessive \ntardiness resulting from alcohol abuse. His bills became delinquent, and he went through a \ndifficult divorce. Even before the job termination, however, Applicant\u2019s financial condition had \nbeen \u201cdifficult for a long time.\u201d Decision at 2. He was living beyond his means, purchased a \nhouse that he could not afford, and had two vehicles repossessed, causing a \u201csnowball effect,\u201d with \nthe result that he could not afford the cost of alcohol and drug rehabilitation treatment.

In 2004 and again in 2009 \nApplicant received inpatient care at \u201creputable inpatient treatment centers.\u201d Id. at 5. Though \nadvised to abstain from alcohol, Applicant returned to drinking following completion of both \ncourses of treatment. He entered another facility in 2019 and has abstained from consuming \nalcohol ever since. \nThe Judge\u2019s Analysis \nThough acknowledging Applicant\u2019s success in resolving most of his debts, the Judge \nconcluded that it is \u201chighly probable\u201d that he will incur significant debt in the future.  Decision at \n7. She stated that Applicant has not yet shown that he can \u201cbeat his disease\u201d of alcoholism, which \nhas had a detrimental effect on his finances.  Id. \nApplicant\u2019s finances and his alcohol consumption go hand in hand. \nWhen \nApplicant is drinking, his finances are in disarray. When he goes into treatment, he \nstops drinking, and cleans up his credit. Applicant has been abstinent since January \n2019, over two years, and his finances have improved and are somewhat under \ncontrol . . . Applicant has more work to do to show the Government that he can be \nconsistently responsible with his financial affairs, in order to meet the eligibility \nrequirements for access to classified information. Id. at 8.  \nDiscussion \nApplicant contends that the Judge was biased against him because of his struggles with \nalcohol abuse. He argues that she relied on this unalleged conduct as a basis for denying him a \nclearance rather than on a reasonable interpretation of his financial condition. Bias involves \npartiality for or against a party, predisposition to decide a case or issue without regard to the merits, \nor other indicia of a lack of impartiality. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 12-09421 at 2 (App. Bd. Nov. \n15, 2017). \nWe have considered Applicant\u2019s arguments in light of the entirety of the record. As \nApplicant notes in his Appeal Brief, alcohol abuse was not alleged in the SOR.

A Judge is precluded from raising security \nconcerns outside the scope of the SOR without amending the SOR and giving the parties a \nreasonable time in which to prepare to address the amendment. However, conduct not alleged or \notherwise fairly embraced by the SOR may be relevant for other purposes: making a credibility \ndetermination; evaluating the applicant\u2019s case for extenuation or mitigation; evaluating the extent \nto which the applicant has demonstrated rehabilitation; and in performing a whole-person analysis.  \nSee, e.g., ISCR Case No. 15-07369 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 16, 2017). \nThe reasons underlying an applicant\u2019s financial problems are relevant matters for the Judge \nto consider in a Guideline F case.  In conducting a mitigation analysis, for example, it is important \nto determine if those underlying reasons have been fully resolved or continue to exist in assessing \nwhether the financial problems are likely to persist or recur. \u201cThe Concern\u201d paragraph under \nGuideline F highlights the importance of the underlying reasons. It notes that financial distress \ncan be caused or exacerbated by various conditions or behaviors, including \u201calcohol abuse or \ndependence.\u201d Directive, Encl. 2., App. A \u00b6 18. The underlying reasons for an applicant\u2019s financial \nproblems need not be alleged in the SOR.   See ISCR Case No. 15-08255 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 22, \n2017) (an SOR is an administrative pleading that is not held to the strict requirements of a criminal \nindictment and it does not have to allege every possible fact that might be relevant at the hearing). \nThe reasons underlying alleged financial problems remain a relevant line of inquiry and an \nappropriate matter for the Judge to consider in rendering a decision even though they possibly \ncould be, but are not, alleged under another guideline.   \nIn the instant case, Applicant himself introduced his struggles with alcohol during his \ntestimony on direct examination. Tr. at 37-41. During this testimony he addressed his drinking \nproblem, its causes, and his attendance at multiple rehabilitation programs. \u201cQ: Can you tell me \nwhy you used alcohol or drugs during that time? A: I believe it was to self-medicate and to . . . \nkill pain, emotional pain . . . during what I would call a very, very difficult marriage and \nrelationship.\u201d Tr. at 38. Regarding the SOR allegations, in documents he himself prepared, \nApplicant attributed his financial difficulties to a job termination, and asserted that this firing was \ndue to tardiness resulting from alcohol abuse which, among other things, was impairing his health.  \nResponse to SOR at 5; Security Clearance Application (SCA) at 35. During cross examination, \nApplicant acknowledged that the tardiness from work that underlay his job termination was \naffected by his alcohol abuse and that on numerous occasions he had been advised to abstain from \nalcohol. Id. at 62, 64. The evidence supports the Judge\u2019s findings that Applicant\u2019s finances had \nbeen stressed for a number of years and that he had twice undergone alcohol treatment after which \nhe returned to drinking, the instance in 2009 at the urging of his now ex-wife. All in all, the record \nsupports a connection between Applicant\u2019s alcohol problems and the financial concerns raised in \nhis SOR. The Judge addressed Applicant\u2019s alcohol problems both in the context of his case for \nmitigation of these financial concerns and as part of her whole-person analysis. After considering \nthe evidence as a whole and paying particular attention to the Judge\u2019s conduct of the hearing as \nreflected in the transcript, we conclude that a reasonable person would not find that the Judge \nexhibited an inflexible predisposition against Applicant due to his struggles with alcohol.  \nAccordingly, Applicant has not met his heavy burden of persuasion that the Judge lacked the \nrequisite impartiality. See, e. g., ISCR Case No. 18-02867 at 3 (App. Bd. Jan. 15, 2020). \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n        \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                       \n \nApplicant challenges a finding by the Judge that his marital problems were due to his \ndrinking. Even if this finding was erroneous it does not appear to have exerted an effect on the \noverall outcome of the case. Therefore, any error in this finding is harmless. See, e.g., ISCR Case \nNo. 18-02581 at 3 (App. Bd. Jan. 14, 2020). Applicant cites to a Hearing Office case in support \nof his appeal.  However, each case must be decided upon its own merits. Directive, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 \n2(b). Hearing Office decisions are binding neither on other Hearing Office Judges nor on the \nBoard. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 18-02074 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 27, 2019). The balance of \nApplicant\u2019s appeal arguments alleges in effect that the Judge failed to consider all of the evidence \nor that she mis-weighed the evidence. Considering the record as a whole, we conclude that \nApplicant has not rebutted the presumption that the Judge considered all of the evidence in the \nrecord, nor has he shown that the Judge weighed the evidence in a manner that was arbitrary, \ncapricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 20-00290 at 4 (App. Bd. Feb. 16, 2022). \nThe Judge examined the relevant evidence and articulated a satisfactory explanation for \nthe decision.

On \nSeptember 15, 2021, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for \nthat decision\u2e3asecurity concerns raised under Guideline G (Alcohol Consumption) and Guideline \nJ (Criminal Conduct) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) \n(Directive). Applicant requested a decision on the written record. On April 21, 2022, after \nconsidering the record, Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) Administrative Judge \nRobert Robinson Gales granted Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance. Department Counsel \nappealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \nDepartment Counsel raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s favorable \ndecision ran contrary to the weight of the record evidence and, therefore, was arbitrary, capricious, \nor contrary to law.  Consistent with the following, we reverse. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe Judge\u2019s Findings of Fact and Analysis \nApplicant has worked for his current employer, a Defense contractor, since 2015. He has \nheld similar positions with other companies since 2008. Applicant served in the military from \n1987 until 1996, at which point he received an honorable discharge. He was granted a security \nclearance in 2012. Married, he has a daughter. \nApplicant began using alcohol while he was in the military. He stated that drinking was \nthe social norm among his fellow service members and that his overall level of consumption was \n\u201cprobably a lot.\u201d Decision at 3. After his 1996 discharge, Applicant matured and had a lifestyle \nchange. He would drink perhaps a beer after work and four or five on weekends while watching \nfootball. Following his last alcohol-related incident, which occurred in 2019, he further scaled \nback his drinking, reducing his consumption from four or five beers while watching televised \nsports to one or two, which has had a positive result. \nIn late 2019, after drinking beer and liquor while watching sports at a friend\u2019s house, \nApplicant was stopped by a policeman for driving north in a southbound lane. After failing a field \nsobriety test, Applicant was charged with DUI, open container, and for a driving offense. He \nattended a DUI school of his own volition.  In early 2020, the state motor vehicle agency restored \nApplicant\u2019s driving privileges because the arresting officer did not appear at an administrative \nhearing to present evidence. \nIn early 2014, Applicant consumed a \u201cgood bit\u201d of beer and liquor while watching football \nat the same friend\u2019s house. Decision at 3. A policeman stopped him due to excessive speed and, \nafter Applicant failed a field sobriety test, arrested Applicant for DUI and speeding. Applicant pled \nguilty to reckless driving and was sentenced to twelve months of unsupervised probation, a $1,315 \nfine, and completion of the DUI school. As happened in 2019, the arresting officer did not appear \nat a hearing convened to determine if Applicant\u2019s license should remain suspended. Consequently, \nthe decision to suspend the license was reversed and the case dismissed. \nApplicant had three earlier DUI incidents in the 1990s. In early 1995 and again in 1996, \nhe was charged with that offense, pled guilty, and was sentenced to probation, a fine, community \nservice, and, in 1996, a weekend in jail. His first DUI offense occurred in early 1994, for which \nhe entered a plea to a reduced offense and was sentenced to a fine. \nThe Judge concluded that Applicant\u2019s misconduct raised concerns under both Guidelines. \nIn deciding that Applicant had mitigated the Guideline G concerns, the Judge cited to evidence \nthat, although Applicant drank heavily in the military, afterward he matured. He noted Applicant\u2019s \nclaim that after his last DUI he had scaled back his drinking significantly, as a consequence of \nwhich he has had no alcohol-related offenses for twenty-eight months. He also relied upon \nApplicant\u2019s candor in having reported his DUIs to his employer. \nUnder Guideline J the Judge relied upon much of the same record evidence. Specifically, \nhe noted that the record contains no evidence of alcohol offenses after late 2019, from which the \nJudge concluded that Applicant has shown rehabilitation. He further stated that compliance with \nthe terms of probation, community service, modified drinking habits, and completion of DUI \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \nschool \u201care all positive factors.\u201d Decision at 8. The Judge concluded that Applicant\u2019s criminal \nconduct no longer casts doubt upon his reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. \nDiscussion \nThere is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of a security clearance. See \nDorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991).  The \napplicant is responsible for presenting evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate admitted \nor proven facts. The applicant has the burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable decision. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.15. The standard applicable in security clearance decisions \u201cis that a clearance \nmay be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests of the national security.\u2019\u201d \nDepartment of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel \nbeing considered for national security eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nDirective, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 2(b). \nIn deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are erroneous, we will review the \ndecision to determine whether: it does not examine relevant evidence; it fails to articulate a \nsatisfactory explanation for its conclusions, including a rational connection between the facts \nfound and the choice made; it does not consider relevant factors; it reflects a clear error of \njudgment; it fails to consider an important aspect of the case; it offers an explanation for the \ndecision that runs contrary to the record evidence; or it is so implausible that it cannot be ascribed \nto a mere difference of opinion. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-02563 at 4 (App. Bd. Aug. 28, 2015). \nDepartment Counsel argues that the Judge\u2019s analysis failed to consider important aspects \nof the record and failed to evaluate the record evidence as a cumulative whole. We find \nDepartment Counsel\u2019s arguments to be persuasive. We note first of all that Applicant did not make \na response to the File of Relevant Material (FORM). Neither did he include a meaningful amount \nof mitigating evidence in his Answer to the SOR. Rather, he admitted the allegations and included \nevidence that, both in 2014 and 2019, the state restored his driving privileges.  While the Judge is \nrequired to consider all of the evidence, these administrative actions provide little context to the \nunderlying offenses and, under the facts of this case, are entitled to little weight in evaluating the \nextent to which Applicant has met his burden of persuasion. \nAccordingly, the Judge\u2019s favorable decision was based in substantial measure on the \nsummary of Applicant\u2019s clearance interview that is included in Item 4, Answers to Interrogatories.  \nDuring this interview, Applicant disclosed that he had consumed alcohol in substantial quantities \nwhile in the military but, after his discharge in 1996, had matured and experienced a lifestyle \nchange. Item 4 at 7-8. Nevertheless, eight years later, he had another DUI incident, followed by \nyet another five years after that. In 2014, Applicant, was stopped for travelling 52 miles per hour \nin a 35 mile per hour zone. During the field sobriety test, Applicant \u201chad trouble maintaining his \nbalance and . . . was staggering.\u201d Item 6, Police Department Records, at 4. A subsequent \nbreathalyzer test yielded .178 and .188 g/ml. Id. at 3, 5. In 2019, Applicant was stopped for \ndriving north in a southbound lane. After Applicant had failed the field sobriety test, the officer \nretrieved Applicant\u2019s cell phone and noticed, in the driver side door, an empty beer can that was \n\u201ccold to the touch,\u201d supporting a reasonable inference that Applicant had consumed alcohol while \ndriving. Item 5, Arrest Report, at 4-8. A test of the alcohol content of Applicant\u2019s breath showed \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \na result of .14 g/mL. Id. at 9. That these two offenses occurred despite Applicant\u2019s claims of a \nchanged lifestyle after leaving the military and despite the passage of several years from his earlier \nmisconduct diminishes the weight to which his current claim of behavioral change is entitled. In \naddition, these offenses are not consistent with the Judge\u2019s conclusion that the twenty-eight months \nthat had elapsed from his last DUI until the close of the record clearly demonstrated rehabilitation.  \nIt is well established that questions regarding the recency of misconduct, or the extent to which \nthe significance of that misconduct has been attenuated through the passage of time, must be \nevaluated in light of the entirety of the record evidence. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 12-03402 at 2 \n(App. Bd. May 4, 2016). The Judge\u2019s analysis failed adequately to explain his conclusion that \ntwenty-eight months without evidence of additional DUIs clearly shows rehabilitation despite \nrecord evidence of such previous re-offenses following the expiration of more extensive periods \nof time. \nMoreover, we note an absence of corroborating evidence for Applicant\u2019s contention that \nhe has instituted permanent changes to his lifestyle and, in particular, his drinking habits. In a \nDOHA case, it is an applicant\u2019s responsibility to present evidence sufficient to mitigate the \nconcerns raised in the SOR, and the applicant bears the ultimate burden of persuasion that he or \nshe should be granted a clearance. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 16-02243 at 2 \n(App. Bd. Nov. 30, 2018). See also ISCR Case No. 17-01193 at 4 (App. Bd. Jan 22, 2019) (It is \nreasonable to expect an applicant to present corroborating documentation of his or her efforts to \nestablish mitigation of the concerns raised in the SOR.) In the case before us, Applicant submitted \nno character references, no statements by knowledgeable persons attesting to his care regarding \nthe consumption of alcohol, no evidence of attendance at Alcoholics Anonymous, no evidence of \nformal counseling, no confirmation of his having completed DUI courses, or any other matter that \nwould lend credibility to his case for mitigation. This paucity of independent mitigating evidence \nsignificantly undercuts the Judge\u2019s conclusion that Applicant has demonstrated rehabilitation. \nWe note Department Counsel\u2019s argument that the Judge substituted a credibility \ndetermination for record evidence. Of course, in a decision on the written record such as this, a \nJudge has no opportunity to evaluate a witness\u2019s demeanor and, therefore, any credibility \ndetermination he or she makes is entitled to less deference than would be appropriate when there \nwas a hearing. See Directive \u204b E3.32.1. In the case under consideration, the Judge appears to have \ngiven conclusive effect to those interview answers contained in Item 4 that were favorable to him \nbut did not address answers that presented Applicant in a less encouraging light. These include \nhis statement that he continued to consume alcohol under the same circumstances that underlay \nhis two most recent offenses\u2014drinking while watching sports with his named friend. They also \ninclude Applicant\u2019s statement that he had reduced his alcohol consumption only months before his \nclearance interview.  Item 4 at 7-8. A Judge cannot ignore, disregard, or fail to discuss significant \nrecord evidence that a reasonable person could expect to be taken into account in reaching a fair \nand reasoned decision. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 15-02903 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 9, 2017). The \nJudge\u2019s analysis failed in this regard. \nTo sum up, the record contains evidence, including Applicant\u2019s SOR admissions, that (1) \nin the mid-1990s he had three arrests for DUI that resulted in convictions; (2) following the last of \nthese incidents Applicant claimed that he had matured and changed his practice regarding drinking; \n(3) after eight years Applicant was again charged with DUI and convicted of reckless driving after \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n        \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                   \n \nhaving consumed liquor and beer at the house of a friend and registering breathalyzer test results \nof .178 and 188 g/ml.; (4) he was again charged with DUI in late 2019, which resulted in a \nconviction for driving on the wrong side of the road following consumption of liquor and beer at \na friend\u2019s home and registering a breathalyzer test result of 1.4 g/ml.; and (5) Applicant continues \nto consume alcohol under circumstances identical to those underlying his two most recent DUI \nincidents. Moreover, Applicant submitted no evidence of any kind that would corroborate the \nclaims in his 2020 clearance interview that he has diminished the amount of alcohol that he \nconsumes.  The concern under both Guidelines raised in the SOR is that problems with alcohol as \nwell as criminal conduct raise questions about an applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. Directive, Encl. 2, App. A \u204b\u204b 21, 30. Such evidence as this case contains is not \nenough to mitigate these concerns in light of the standard set forth in Egan, supra. The Judge\u2019s \nfavorable decision fails to consider important aspects of the case and runs contrary to the weight \nof the record evidence.  Accordingly, the Judge\u2019s decision is not sustainable. \nOrder \nThe Decision is REVERSED. \nSigned: James F. Duffy \nJames F.

On \nNovember 30, 2021, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for \nthat decision\u2015security concerns raised under Guideline J (Criminal Conduct), Guideline G \n(Alcohol Consumption), and Guideline E (Personal Conduct) of DoD Directive 5220.6 (January \n2, 1992, as amended) (Directive). Applicant requested a decision on the written record. On \nNovember 10, 2022, after considering the record, Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals \n(DOHA) Administrative Judge Wilford H. Ross denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security \nclearance. Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. For reasons stated \nbelow, we affirm the decision. \nUnder Guideline J, the SOR alleged that Applicant was charged with offenses on seven \noccasions between 2011 and 2021. These offenses include driving under the influence (DUI) on \nthree occasions, including most recently in 2021; disorderly conduct; communicating a threat; \nviolation of a protection order and simple assault; and public intoxication. The alcohol-related \noffenses were cross-alleged under Guideline G. Under Guideline E, the SOR alleged Applicant \nfalsified responses in his 2020 security clearance application (SCA) questions by failing to disclose \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nmatters from his police record.

The Judge found against Applicant on all of the allegations.  \nIn his appeal brief, Applicant does not dispute any of the Judge\u2019s specific findings of facts. \nRegarding the Guideline J and G allegations, he highlights certain mitigating conditions and argues \nthose condition apply in his case. None of his arguments, however, are sufficient to rebut the \npresumption the Judge considered all of the evidence in the record or to demonstrate that the Judge \nweighed the evidence in a matter that was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. See, e.g., ISCR \nCase No. 19-01400 at 2 (App. Bd. Jun. 3, 2020). \nRegarding the Guideline E allegations, Applicant contends that he did not intentionally fail \nto disclose matters from his police record and argues he misread the questions. We note a \nproblematic issue regarding the adverse falsification findings. Both SOR \u00b6\u00b6 3.a and 3.b alleged \nApplicant \u201cdeliberately failed to disclose\u201d certain information from his police record. The Judge \nconcluded that Disqualifying Condition 16(a), which requires \u201cdeliberate omission, concealment, \nor falsification of relevant facts from any personnel security questionnaire . . . [,]\u201d was the only \ndisqualifying condition that applied to the falsification allegations. In light of Applicant\u2019s \nassertions that he misread the SCA questions, record evidence was needed to establish the \nomissions were deliberate to prove the alleged falsifications.  \nAlthough the Judge concluded that Applicant \u201cfalsified\u201d his SCA responses, he also stated \nin his analysis that Applicant \u201cknew or should have known about his disclosure obligations.\u201d \nDecision at 9. The \u201cor should have known\u201d part of the standard employed by the Judge falls short \nof the requirement of proving a deliberate omission. In order to prove a deliberate SCA omission, \nan applicant must have understood the question at issue and must have knowingly failed to disclose \nrequested information. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 02-11286 at 4 (App. Bd. Jun. 29, 2004) (an \nomission, standing along, is not proof of a deliberate falsification) and ISCR Case No. 05-03472 \nat 6 (App. Bd. Mar. 12 2007) (the Judge must make findings about Applicant\u2019s culpable state of \nmind that are reasonably supported by the record evidence for an adverse falsification finding to \nbe sustainable). No deliberate falsification occurs when an applicant should have known of his \nobligation to disclose information but did not know of that obligation. Even though the Judge \nerred in his analysis of the falsification allegations, this error was harmless because it did not likely \naffect the outcome of the case. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 19-01220 at 3 (App. Bd. Jun. 1, 2020).  \nIn this regard, the adverse Guideline J and G findings are sufficient to sustain the denial of \nApplicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility.  \nApplicant failed to establish the Judge committed any harmful error. The Judge examined \nthe relevant evidence and articulated a satisfactory explanation for the decision. The decision is \nsustainable on the record. \u201cThe general standard is that a clearance may be granted only when \n\u2018clearly consistent with national security.\u2019\u201d Department of the Navy v.

The Judge\u2019s favorable findings under Guideline F are not at issue \nin this appeal.  Consistent with the following, we affirm. \nThe Judge\u2019s Findings of Fact and Analysis \nApplicant is in her early 30s and seeks to obtain a security clearance in connection with \nher job. The specific findings pertinent to the issues raised on appeal center around an incident of \nDUI and its aftermath. Applicant was arrested and charged with that offense in June 2019, her \nblood alcohol level registering .16. She was sentenced to 12 months of confinement with 11 \nmonths and 25 days suspended, a fine, and supervised probation. \nApplicant successfully \ncompleted a substance abuse counseling program. In late 2019 and again in early 2020, Applicant \nfailed to report to the local sheriff\u2019s office for the completion of required community service and \nwas charged with a probation violation. On both occasions she claimed that she had been working \nlate and that it was difficult for her to arrive at the sheriff\u2019s office early in the morning. As result \nof her second offense Applicant was required to serve seven days \u201cstraight time\u201d in jail. Decision \nat 5. The Judge concluded that Applicant\u2019s misconduct demonstrates \u201cpoor judgment, immaturity, \nand a total disregard for the law,\u201d thereby impugning her trustworthiness and reliability. Id. at 8. \nThe Judge held that Applicant had not mitigated the concerns arising from her criminal conduct. \nDiscussion \nApplicant contends that the Judge did not consider all of the evidence that she submitted \nin her behalf, making specific reference to her character references. Applicant attaches to her \nappeal brief copies of documents that she had included in her Answer to the SOR and in her \nResponse to the File of Relevant Material. In addition, her brief cites to matters that she believes \nprovide context to her security concerns.  \nWe have considered Applicant\u2019s arguments in light of the totality of the record evidence. \nThe Judge made findings about many of the things Applicant cites in her brief, including her \ncharacter references and her explanation for her probation violations. A Judge cannot be expected \nto explicitly address every pieces of record evidence, which would be a virtual impossibility. \nApplicant has not rebutted the presumption that the Judge considered all of the evidence in the \nrecord. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 18-02872 at 3 (App. Bd. Jan. 15, 2020). Applicant\u2019s brief \nconsists, in large measure, of a disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, which is \nnot enough to show that the Judge weighed the evidence in a manner that was arbitrary, capricious, \nor contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 20-03789 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 20, 2022).  \nThe Judge examined the relevant evidence and articulated a satisfactory explanation for \nthe decision.

In the Analysis, the Judge cited to the \nnine years that had elapsed since Applicant\u2019s last alleged incident of criminal conduct. \nNevertheless, he concluded that Applicant\u2019s failure to provide any information as to why he \napparently stopped a 33-year pattern of misconduct precluded a finding that he is rehabilitated.  \nConcerning the Guideline E allegation of deliberate failure to have disclosed the full extent of his \ncriminal conduct, the Judge noted that Applicant had admitted all of the SOR allegations without \nexplanation, that he presented no evidence of attempting to correct his omissions, or that he had \ntaken steps to avoid such conduct in the future. Accordingly, the Judge concluded that Applicant \nhad failed to meet his burden of persuasion regarding mitigation. \nDiscussion \nMuch of Applicant\u2019s brief consists of matters from outside the record, which we cannot \nconsider. Directive \u204b E3.1.29. Applicant contends that the reason he omitted many of his offenses \nwas that the charges were dismissed. See, e.g., Item 4, FBI Record. This argument on its face \ndoes not undermine the Judge\u2019s finding of deliberate omission. The SCA provides, at Section 18, \nthat a criminal offense must be disclosed \u201cregardless of whether . . . the charge was dismissed\u201d \n(Item 3 at 24), and there is no record evidence to the effect that Applicant was unaware of that \nrequirement. Moreover, as the Judge found, Applicant admitted all of the allegations, including \nthe one for deliberate omission, without explanation. Item 2, Answer to SOR. Applicant argues \nthat the Judge erred by finding that he has no children. While he disclosed no children in his SCA, \na court record reflects he had child support liens entered against him, but this error in the findings \nwas harmless. Item 3 at 18-20 and Item 5 at 42-43. The Judge\u2019s material findings are based upon \nsubstantial evidence. See, e.g. ISCR Case No. 18-02581 at 3 (App. Bd. Jan. 14, 2020). Applicant \nhas not raised any issue of harmful error that is cognizable by the Appeal Board.  \nThe Judge examined the relevant evidence and articulated a satisfactory explanation for \nthe decision.

After a divorce in 2014, Applicant was responsible for several debts \nbut could not pay initially. In the years that followed, various creditors attempted to collect. \nHowever, on the advice of an attorney, Applicant elected to allow the statute of limitations to run \non the delinquent accounts. In 2019, he contacted the creditor who held two of the three alleged \naccounts to negotiate a settlement. That attempt was unsuccessful: the creditor offered to settle \nfor 55% of the delinquencies, but Applicant was unwilling to pay more than 25%. \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant and his attorney noted that the statute of limitations \nhad now run, freeing him from legal liability for the debts.

The accounts no longer appear on the most recent credit reports. \nWhile the statute of limitations may have run and the accounts are no longer being reported, the \naccounts remain unresolved. \nThere is no evidence of financial counseling, a budget, or anything to \ndescribe with any specificity Applicant\u2019s current financial situation. . . . Applicant \ndid not report his net monthly income, his monthly household expenses, or any \nmonthly debt payments. In the absence of such information, I am unable to \ndetermine if he has any monthly remainder available for savings or spending. There \nis a paucity of evidence to indicate that his financial problems are now under \ncontrol, and it is difficult to determine if Applicant is currently in a better position \nfinancially than he had been, or if he has the funds available to pay his debts but is \nsimply choosing not to do so.  [Decision at 4.] \nThe Judge\u2019s Analysis: The Judge\u2019s analysis is quoted below, in pertinent part. \nBecause [Applicant] was in the process of rebuilding his life with his new wife, on \nthe advice of an attorney, he decided to allow the statute of limitations to run so \nthat he would be no longer legally liable for the debts. Instead of accepting his \nfinancial responsibilities and resolving those debts \u2013 debts incurred by him in \nreceiving things of benefit from the creditors while married to his first wife \u2013 he \nchose to ignore those debts. In 2019, one creditor of two separate debts offered to \nsettle those accounts for 55 per cent of the unpaid balance, but Applicant was only \nwilling to pay 25 per cent. \n. \n. \n. \nWhile he may not be legally liable for those delinquent debts because of the statute \nof limitations, and those debts may have been removed from his credit reports, \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \nDiscussion \n \n \n \nLegal Advice and the Statute of Limitations \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \nError in the Findings of Fact \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant has not acted responsibly by failing to address those delinquent accounts \nwhile employed . . . .  \n. \n. \n. \nThere is no evidence of financial counseling, a budget, or current financial \ninformation. Applicant\u2019s actions or in-action under the circumstances cast \nsignificant doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. \n[Decision at 6\u20139.] \nApplicant asserts that he acted upon legal advice in allowing the statute of limitations to \nrun. First, the Board has repeatedly noted that reliance on a statute of limitations does not \nconstitute a good faith effort to resolve financial difficulties. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 03-04779 \nat 4 (App. Bd. Jul. 20, 2005). Second, Applicant\u2019s reliance on legal advice is similarly misplaced, \nas he now recognizes: \u201cI repeat that at this point I consider that the attorney advice was not the \nbest.\u201d Appeal Brief at 3. For years, Applicant did not heed valid collection efforts from various \ncreditors: the fact that he did so upon legal advice in the context of a divorce proceeding does not \nextinguish the Government\u2019s security concerns. A security clearance adjudication is a proceeding \naimed at evaluating an applicant's judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness to make a decision \nabout the applicant's security eligibility. The Federal government is entitled to consider the facts \nand circumstances surrounding an applicant\u2019s conduct in incurring and failing to satisfy the debt \nin a timely manner. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 01-09691 at 3 (Mar. 27, 2003). \nApplicant challenges the Judge\u2019s finding that he did not submit a monthly budget, pointing \nto the completed Personal Financial Statement that is included in his response to the Government\u2019s \ninterrogatories. That document\u2014admitted without objection as part of the Government\u2019s case\u2014 \ndetails Applicant\u2019s monthly income, monthly expenses, monthly remainder, debts, and assets. GE \n3 at 48. From the Judge\u2019s findings of fact and analysis, it appears clear that he overlooked this \nparticular page in his review of the evidence. \nHaving established that the Judge failed to consider this document, the Board must \ndetermine whether that error was harmful, requiring remand. If there is a significant chance that \nthe case might have been decided differently, but for the error, that error is harmful. Conversely, \nan error that likely had no effect on the Judge\u2019s decision is harmless. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 00\u00ad\n0250 at 6 (App. Bd. Jul. 11, 2001). \nReviewing the record in its entirety, the Board concludes that the error does not warrant \nremand because there is not a significant chance that the Judge would have reached a different \ndecision had he reviewed the Personal Financial Statement. The Judge\u2019s decision rests on \nApplicant\u2019s failure to address his debts and his election, instead, to allow the statute of limitations \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n     \n \n \nNew Evidence and Lack of Security Risk \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nto run. The Judge specifically finds that he lacks current financial information and cannot \n\u201cdetermine if [Applicant] has any monthly remainder available\u201d and whether \u201che has the funds \navailable to pay his debts but is simply choosing not to do so.\u201d Decision at 4. Our review of \nApplicant\u2019s Personal Financial Statement confirms that Applicant had available funds and assets \nto address these delinquencies. Inarguably, that information does not help Applicant\u2019s case and \nwould not result in a different decision by the Judge. We conclude that the error was harmless. \nApplicant makes no other assertion of harmful error on the part of the Judge but does \nsubmit additional details and background information to supplement the evidence that was before \nthe Judge.  Those matters constitute new evidence, which the Board is not authorized to consider.  \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.29. \nFinally, Applicant argues that the debts do not make him a security threat, as he could not \nbe \u201cforced to steal or do something wrong . . . to pay them.\u201d Appeal Brief at 4. We do not find \nthis argument persuasive. Guideline F security concerns are broader than the possibility that an \napplicant might knowingly compromise classified information in order to raise money to satisfy \ndelinquent debts. Such security concerns also encompass the risk that applicants who are \nfinancially irresponsible might also be irresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and \nsafeguarding classified information. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 16-04112 at 3\u20134 (App. Bd. May 28, \n2019).  Having admitted the delinquent debts, Applicant had the burden of mitigating the security \nconcerns arising from those debts and failed to do so. \nThe Judge examined the relevant evidence and articulated a satisfactory explanation for \nthe decision.  The decision is sustainable on this record.  \u201cThe general standard is that a clearance \nmay be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests of the national security.\u2019\u201d \nDepartment of the Navy v.

He used marijuana only for medicinal purposes.  In his response to the SOR, \nApplicant stated, \u201cI am willing to work and find an alternative medical solution, but until that \nmedical solution is found, I\u2019m going to continue to use the medical solution that works, as it is \nlegal in my state to do so.\u201d Decision at 2\u20133, quoting SOR Response.

Lokey Anderson denied \nApplicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 \nand E3.1.30. \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant had 11 delinquent debts totaling over $37,000. In \nresponding to the SOR, Applicant admitted each of the allegations. The Judge found against \nApplicant on ten of the alleged debts. \nApplicant\u2019s brief asserts that the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.d \u201cmay be\u201d and \u201cappears\u201d to be a \nduplicate of the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.k. Appeal Brief at 1 and 5. He does not explain the basis for \nthat supposition. While both allegations list the same collection agency as the creditor, we see no \nother reason to conclude these allegations are duplicates. Of note, Item 4 of the File of Relevant \nMaterial (FORM) reflects that a judgment was entered against Applicant in September 2018 for \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n       \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nthe debt in SOR \u00b6 1.k, while a credit report dated August 26, 2021 (FORM Item 6 at 2) lists the \ndebt in SOR \u00b6 1.d as a collection account. The amounts of the two debts are close but not exact.  \nIn responding to the SOR, Applicant admitted both debts, indicated he was making payments on \nboth debts, noted he did not have a copy of the payment agreement for one of them, and did not \nassert they were duplicate debts. In short, Applicant has failed to demonstrate these two allegations \nare duplicates. Moreover, even if these two allegations were duplicates, it is unlikely such an error \nwould have had changed the outcome of this case. \nThe remainder of Applicant\u2019s brief is an update on the status of the alleged debts.

Lynch denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security \nclearance.

The Judge found that Applicant had supplied no information \nabout her income and expenses and no evidence of financial counseling.  Applicant did obtain the \nservices of two debt resolution companies but stopped using them. The Judge found that most of \nApplicant\u2019s efforts at debt resolution occurred after receipt of the SOR. \nIn the Analysis portion of the Decision, the Judge noted circumstances beyond Applicant\u2019s \ncontrol that affected her financial condition. However, she concluded that Applicant had not \nshown sufficient responsibility in resolving her debts to meet her burden of persuasion as to \nmitigation. The Judge also cited to a paucity of record evidence regarding Applicant\u2019s current \nincome, a monthly budget, and financial counseling. \nApplicant\u2019s brief includes information from outside the record, which we cannot consider \n(Directive \u204b E3.1.29), except for the following. Applicant has presented email traffic between her \nsecurity manager and DOHA officials regarding her Response to the File of Relevant Information \n(FORM). She states that the DOHA official with whom she dealt did not mention having received \nher Response and that the Judge did not acknowledge receipt either. Although these assertions \nconstitute new evidence, we will consider them insofar as they pertain to the threshold issue of due \nprocess. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 18-01764 at 1-2 (App. Bd. Jun. 4, 2019). \nApplicant has attached to her brief email traffic and USPS tracking information. The \nrecord contains a document showing that Applicant received the FORM on May 11, 2022, and the \nUSPS tracking information shows that Applicant\u2019s Response thereto was delivered to DOHA on \nJune 13, 2022. In reply to a November 16, 2022, email query by Applicant a DOHA official stated \nthat her FORM response had been received and passed on to the Judge. At the beginning of the \nDecision the Judge noted that Applicant had responded to the FORM, although she did not \nexplicitly identify the submitted documents. Decision at 1. She did, however, state in her findings \nthat Applicant\u2019s Response included three credit bureau reports, which is consistent with the record. \nDecision at 3. All in all, Applicant\u2019s appeal brief and attachments do not establish a prima facie \ncase that Applicant submitted evidence that was not included in the record. We conclude that \nApplicant was not denied an opportunity to present evidence in mitigation. \nApplicant cites to evidence regarding a settlement agreement she has with the auto loan \ncreditor. The Judge resolved this debt adversely to Applicant, finding that payment under the \nagreement was not to begin until January 2023. Decision at 3. Actually, that is the date upon \nwhich payments are expected to end. Settlement Offer dated June 6, 2022, included in Response \nto FORM. Accordingly, this finding is in error. However, the agreement was finalized six months \nafter the date of the SOR, which supports the Judge\u2019s finding about the timing of Applicant\u2019s \nefforts at debt resolution. Therefore, the error in question did not likely affect the overall outcome \nof the case and is, accordingly, harmless. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 18-02722 at 4 (App. Bd. Jan. \n30, 2020). \nrequires the Judge to make formal findings on each allegation. In this case, the Judge\u2019s error in failing to make formal \nfindings on five allegations, however, is harmless. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n        \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                       \n \nApplicant\u2019s arguments on appeal are not sufficient to show that the Judge weighed the \nevidence in a manner that was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.

At the end of 2021 the bank notified Applicant that it was no longer attempting \nto collect these debts and that he was not required to make payments.  Applicant \u201cclaimed that he \ndid everything he could to satisfy these debts.\u201d Decision at 2. These claimed efforts included \npartial payments, an attempt to set up a payment plan, an attempt to remove the co-signer, an \nattempt to amend the monthly payments, and attempts to pay the debts. Applicant \u201cprovided no \ndocumentary proof to support these assertions.\u201d  Id. \nApplicant attributed his inability to make payments to a co-signer, insofar as the bank \nwould not agree to negotiate with him without that person\u2019s participation.  Applicant asserted that \nthe co-signer was \u201coff the grid, . . . uncontactable, and unwilling to cooperate with [bank] in any \ncircumstances.\u201d Decision at 2. He also asserted that the bank had been \u201cheld accountable in 2016 \nfor illegal and unethical practices,\u201d which impaired his ability to resolve his debts. He provided \nno documentary proof of his contentions. Id. at 2-3. \nApplicant took overseas vacations in 2017 and 2018, and in 2021 he purchased an \nautomobile that entailed a monthly payment in excess of $800. Later that year he purchased \nanother car, the monthly payments for which was a little over $1,000. These accounts are current.  \nApplicant was unemployed from May through December of 2020, due to the Covid-19 pandemic. \nThough Applicant\u2019s difficulty in resolving his student loans may have been affected by his \nunemployment, he did not demonstrate responsible action in regard to these debts. He failed to \nprovide documentation in support of his claimed efforts to resolve his debts, there being \u201cno \nevidence in the record, other than his claims, that he acted responsibly.\u201d Decision at 5. That \nApplicant\u2019s debts are now legally unenforceable does not mitigate his failure to have taken more \naggressive action to satisfy his obligations. The Judge noted Applicant\u2019s expenditures on things \nsuch as vacations and cars, which shows that \u201che picks and chooses\u201d which creditors to pay. \nDecision at 5. The Judge concluded that Applicant had not met his burden of persuasion that he \nshould have a security clearance.  \nDiscussion \nApplicant challenges the Judge\u2019s findings of fact, arguing that she did not address evidence \nfavorable to him. This evidence includes his attempts to persuade his co-signer to cooperate in \nresolving the debts, the likely economic benefit of his formal education, information that could \nhave been accessed through a URL cited in the Response to the File of Relevant Material (FORM), \nthe purposes for his foreign travel, etc. Applicant attaches to his brief a copy of the information \nthat he contends would have been available through the URL.1 Applicant\u2019s appeal submission \nincludes matters from outside the record, which we cannot consider. Directive \u204b E3.1.29. We \n1A Judge is not responsible for creating or reconstructing evidence, including documents retrievable by means of a \nURL or a hyperlink. For one thing, \u201c[g]iven the dynamic and changing nature of the internet,\u201d a Judge cannot be \ncertain that documents accessed in this manner are identical to those an applicant seeks to introduce into evidence. \nSee, e.g., ISCR Case No. 00-0628 at 3-4 (Apr. 26, 2002). In any event, a Judge may not act as a surrogate for either \nparty. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-04388 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 1, 2018). \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nnote that in his security clearance application Applicant states that one of his foreign trips was for \neducational purposes. Item 2 at 34. This is at least somewhat inconsistent with the Judge\u2019s finding \nthat both trips were vacations. Accordingly, the challenged finding about the purpose of this trip \nis in error. However, we find no reason to conclude that, had this error not been made, the decision \nwould have turned out differently.  Accordingly, this error is harmless. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. \n18-02581 at 3 (App. Bd. Jan. 14, 2020). \nWe have examined Judge\u2019s findings as a whole and conclude that they are based upon \nsubstantial evidence or constitute reasonable inferences that could be drawn from the evidence. \nSee, e.g., ISCR Case No. 18-02581 at 3. A Judge cannot be expected to make findings about \neverything in a file, which would be a virtual impossibility. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 18-02872 at \n3 (App. Bd. Jan. 15, 2020). Contrary to Applicant\u2019s arguments on appeal, the Judge\u2019s findings \ncapture the essential facts underlying the SOR allegations. Applicant has cited to no harmful error \nin the Judge\u2019s findings of fact. \nApplicant\u2019s arguments, including some of his challenges to the Judge\u2019s findings, constitute \nin large measure a disagreement with the manner in which the Judge weighed the evidence. \nHowever, an ability to argue for a different interpretation of the evidence is not sufficient to show \nthat the Judge weighed the evidence in a manner that was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. \nSee, e.g., ISCR Case No. 18-02872 at 3. Applicant\u2019s arguments are not sufficient to rebut the \npresumption that the Judge failed to consider all of the evidence in the record. Id. Moreover, \ndespite Applicant\u2019s citation to the whole-person factors described in Directive, Encl. 2, App. A \u204b \n2(d), we conclude that the Judge satisfied these requirements insofar as she based her ultimate \ndecision on the record evidence viewed as a whole. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 18-02925 at 3 (App. \nBd. Jan. 15, 2020). \nThe Judge examined the relevant evidence and articulated a satisfactory explanation for \nthe decision, including in particular her comments regarding the absence of corroborating \nevidence. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-01193 at 4 (App. Bd. Jan 22, 2019) (It is reasonable to \nexpect an applicant to present corroborating documentation of his or her efforts to establish \nmitigation of the concerns raised in the SOR). The decision is sustainable on this record. \u201cThe \ngeneral standard is that a clearance may be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests \nof the national security.\u2019\u201d Department of the Navy v.

The administrative record contains Applicant\u2019s responses to the SOR and Department \nCounsel\u2019s File of Relevant Material (FORM).

In August 1999, following Applicant\u2019s discharge, an attorney acting on his behalf \nrequested reinstatement of the clearance, and it was reinstated in May 2001.1 When submitting \nSCAs in November 2007, August 2014, and December 2018, Applicant answered \u201cNo\u201d to the \nquestion asking if he had ever had a security clearance suspended or revoked. Those three failures \nto disclose the suspension of his clearance are alleged as SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a, 2.f, and 2.g. \nAt the hearing, Applicant testified: \u201cI took the question as asking about \noperational suspension, and I did not remember any at the time. Because it \nhappened between out-processing from one unit and in-processing into another \nunit, I did not consider it to be an operational suspension, and I forgot about it \ncompletely as a reportable event.\u201d [Decision at 4, quoting Tr. at 25.] \nThe reinstatement request contains a letter from Applicant. Even though Applicant was awarded nonjudicial \npunishment for the July 1998 incident and then discharged from the military with a general discharge, Applicant states \nin that letter, \u201cI am applying for reinstatement of my top-secret security clearance which was suspended July of 1998 \nwhile I was facing criminal charges. Those charges were found groundless and were dropped.\u201d Government Exhibit \n(GE) 7 at 5. \n1 \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nIn January 2003, Applicant was charged with obstructing an officer, disorderly conduct \ninvolving drugs or alcohol, and disturbing the peace. In March 2003, he pled nolo contendere and \nwas convicted. His sentence included a fine, restitution, and two years\u2019 probation. In his November \n2007 SCA, Applicant answered \u201cNo\u201d to the questions asking: \u201cHave you ever been charged with \nor convicted of any offense(s) related to alcohol or drugs?\u201d and \u201cIn the last 7 years, have you been \narrested for, charged with, or convicted of any offense(s) not listed in response to [other law\u00ad\nenforcement-related questions]?\u201d His failure to disclose the 2003 charges and conviction on his \n2007 SCA is alleged as SOR \u00b6 2.e. \nIn November 2012, Applicant filed a petition seeking dismissal of the 2003 charges. In \nJanuary 2013, the plea and finding of guilt were vacated and the charges were dismissed. At \nhearing, Applicant testified that his attorney advised him that a nolo contendere plea would result \nin the entire proceeding being expunged from his record, but he did not provide any documentation \nof his claim of erroneous advice. \nThe Judge\u2019s Analysis: The Judge\u2019s analysis is quoted in pertinent part below. \nThe evidence establishes . . . SOR \u00b6 2.e, alleging concealment of the fact \nthat he was charged with an alcohol-related offense. While Applicant submitted \nevidence that his conviction was set aside, he offered no explanation for failing to \ndisclose in his SCA that he had been charged with an alcohol-related offense. When \nhe submitted the SCA in November 2007, he was a well-educated adult who had \npreviously gone through the adjudication process in 1992. The questions in the SCA \nclearly asked whether he had been arrested, charged, or convicted of an alcohol-\nrelated offense. I conclude that his failure to disclose that he was charged with an \nalcohol-related offense was an intentional omission. \nThe evidence establishes the falsifications alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a, 2.f, and \n2.g. Applicant may not have known that his security clearance was suspended while \nhis conduct in 1998 was being investigated, and falsification of this part of his 2007 \nSCA is not alleged. However, he knew that the suspension raised security issues \nwhen he submitted SCAs in August 2014 and December 2018, because he had hired \na lawyer in August 2011 to seek reinstatement of his clearance. His quibbling about \nwhether the suspense was an \u201coperational suspension\u201d is not persuasive. A security \nclearance investigation is not a forum for an applicant to split hairs or parse the \ntruth narrowly. \n. \n. \n. \nThe following mitigating conditions are relevant: \nAG \u00b6 17(a): the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the \nomission, concealment, or falsification before being confronted with the \nfacts; and \nAG \u00b6 17(c): the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the \nbehavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nthat it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s \nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. \nAG \u00b6 17(a) is not established. Applicant made no effort to correct his SCAs \nuntil confronted with the evidence. \nAG \u00b6 17(c) is established for the [underlying offenses/misconduct from \n1998 and 2003], which are mitigated by the passage of time. It is not established \nfor the falsifications alleged in \u00b6\u00b6 2.e, 2.f, and 2.g. They are not minor offenses, and \nthey reflect a pattern of deception. An act of falsification has security significance \nindependent of the underlying conduct. The mitigation of the underlying conduct \nhas little bearing on the security significance of the falsification, particularly where \nthere are multiple falsifications. Falsification of a security clearance application \n\u201cstrikes at the heart of the security clearance process.\u201d [Decision at 8\u201310.] (internal \ncitations omitted) \nDiscussion \nJurisdiction \nBefore turning to the issues raised by Applicant on appeal, a jurisdictional issue merits \nmentioning. As a matter of necessity, a Hearing Office Judge and the Appeal Board have the \nauthority to consider and resolve the threshold issue of whether there is subject matter jurisdiction \nto adjudicate a particular security clearance case under the Directive. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 02\u00ad\n24227 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 7, 2003) (citing Barnett v. Brown, 83 F.3d 1380, 1383 (Fed. Cir. 1996)). \nThe lack of subject matter jurisdiction is a non-waivable issue. It can be raised by either party at \nany time during the proceeding and can be raised sua sponte by the Appeal Board even if neither \nparty raises it.  Id. \nUnder the Directive, DOHA generally has jurisdiction to make security clearance \neligibility determinations in cases forwarded through proper channels that involve U.S. citizens \nwho hold or require access to classified information in connection with their employment in the \nprivate sector. Directive \u00b6\u00b6 2.3 and 3.1. In this case, the Judge found that Applicant was employed \nby \u201canother government agency\u201d (Decision at 2), which raises the issue whether DOHA has \njurisdiction to process this case under the Directive. Based on our review of the record, however, \nwe conclude the Judge\u2019s finding is in error. The record sufficiently establishes that Applicant \nworks for a defense contractor and that DOHA has jurisdiction to process this case. See \nCorrespondence File.  \nApplicant\u2019s Assignments of Error \nOn appeal, Applicant has two primary arguments. The first is that the Judge made harmful \nfactual errors in his analysis of the allegations related to Applicant\u2019s failure to disclose suspension \nof his clearance (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a, 2.f, and 2.g). The second argument is a broader claim that the Judge \nfailed to consider all the mitigation evidence. We turn first to the allegation of harmful error in the \nJudge\u2019s analysis section. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFactual Errors in Analysis \nApplicant does not challenge the Judge\u2019s findings of fact regarding the suspension of his \nclearance and its reinstatement, that is, Applicant concurs in the Judge\u2019s findings that his clearance \nwas suspended in July 1998, that an attorney acting on his behalf requested reinstatement in August \n1999, and that the clearance was reinstated in May 2001. Appeal Brief at 7\u20138, 14. We note that the \nrecord firmly supports those uncontested dates. GE 7. Applicant highlights, however, that the \nJudge made a factual mistake with regard to those dates in his subsequent analysis section and \nargues that this was \u201cclear harmful error\u201d as the Judge \u201cbases his entire analysis\u201d on the erroneous \ndates. Appeal Brief at 14. This argument is of mixed merit. We agree that the Judge made factual \nerrors in his analysis section but conclude that the errors are harmless. \nHaving found as fact that Applicant hired an attorney in August 1999 to seek reinstatement \nof his suspended clearance (Decision at 3), the Judge later conflated dates and stated that Applicant  \n\u201chired a lawyer in August 2011 to seek reinstatement of his clearance.\u201d Decision at 8. Based on \nthis erroneous date, the Judge stated that Applicant \u201cknew that the suspension raised security issues \nwhen he submitted SCAs in August 2014 and December 2018,\u201d but \u201cmay not have known that his \nsecurity clearance was suspended while his conduct in 1998 was being investigated.\u201d Id. \nMoreover, the Judge noted that \u201cfalsification of this part of his 2007 SCA is not alleged.\u201d Id. This \nanalysis is factually incorrect in at least two regards. First, Applicant inarguably hired an attorney \nto seek reinstatement of his clearance in August 1999, not August 2011. Second, the falsification \nof his 2007 SCA regarding this matter is alleged (SOR \u00b6 2.f). Indeed, the Judge found adversely \nto Applicant on this allegation in his formal findings. \nBased on these errors, Applicant makes two arguments: first, that \u201cthe Judge\u2019s analysis of \nthe facts completely clears\u201d Applicant of his 2007 falsification (SOR \u00b6 2.f), formal finding \nnotwithstanding; and, second, that the Judge\u2019s \u201cfactual basis\u201d for the 2014 and 2018 falsifications \n(SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.g, 2.a) is \u201cclearly erroneous\u201d because \u201cno Attorney was hired in 2011.\u201d Appeal Brief at \n8. Applicant argues that these errors render the Judge\u2019s decision arbitrary, capricious, and he seeks \nreversal or remand. Id. at 11. We are not persuaded.   \nFirst, we concur that the Judge erred in his analysis by misstating dates that he earlier stated \ncorrectly in his findings of facts. We turn now to our determination of whether that error is harmful \nor harmless. In making that determination, we consider the identified errors in the context of the \nJudge\u2019s decision as a whole. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 00-0621 at 4 (App. Bd. Jan. 30, 2002). \nUpon review of the record and the Judge\u2019s decision in its entirety, we conclude the Judge\u2019s error \nregarding Applicant hiring an attorney in 2011 was a typographical error. Applicant\u2019s request to \nreinstate his security clearance contains a letter from his attorney that is dated August 11, 1999. \nGE 7. In drafting the decision, the Judge appears to have mistakenly shortened this date to \u201cAugust \n2011.\u201d An error of that nature was harmless. See, e.g., ISCR Case No.00-0250 at 2 (App. Bd. Feb. \n13, 2001). \nWe further conclude the Judge\u2019s erroneous finding that the SOR did not allege Applicant \nfalsified his 2007 SCA by failing to disclose his prior security clearance suspension is \u201can \nunexplained anomaly\u201d and \u201cnot an integral part of the Judge\u2019s analysis.\u201d ISCR Case No. 00-0104 \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nat 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 21, 2001). The Judge\u2019s formal finding against Applicant on that falsification \n(SOR \u00b6 2.f) is well-supported by his findings of fact and by those portions of the record to which \nhe cites, which confirm that Applicant knew his clearance was suspended in 1998, that he \nacknowledged the same in correspondence seeking reinstatement in 1999, and that he hired an \nattorney in 1999 to aid in that endeavor. GE 7. Moreover, the Judge\u2019s adverse findings on the 2014 \nand 2018 falsifications (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.g, 2.a) are equally well-supported, as he properly relies upon \nApplicant\u2019s retention of counsel prior to submission of those SCAs to demonstrate mens rea. \nContrary to Applicant\u2019s argument, the fact that he hired counsel in 1999 vice 2011 in no way \nundermines the Judge\u2019s analysis of these two allegations. Under the particular facts of this case, \nthe anomaly highlighted by Applicant constitutes harmless error that does not warrant either \nremand or reversal as there is not a significant chance that, but for this error, the Judge would have \nreached a different result. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 00-0104 at 3\u20134. \nApplicant cites to several other minor errors in the Judge\u2019s findings (e.g., Applicant\u2019s \ncontention that the woman whom he evicted topless from his apartment was not a \u201cstripper,\u201d but \ninstead a \u201ccollege-aged individual\u201d), but cites to no error in the Judge\u2019s findings that likely affected \nthe outcome of the case. Appeal Brief at 16. \nMisweighing the Evidence and Misapplying the Mitigating Conditions \nIn a broader argument, Applicant contends that the Judge failed to give appropriate weight \nto his evidence in mitigation and misapplied the mitigation conditions. For example, Applicant \nrepeatedly highlights as mitigating evidence both his \u201cfaulty memory from his military service \ninjuries\u201d in Iraq in the 2003 to 2004 timeframe and the fact that he made an \u201cunprompted\u201d and \n\u201cvoluntary\u201d disclosure of his clearance suspension in his second supplemental answer to the SOR, \nsubmitted in January 2022. Appeal Brief at 4, 5, 7, 12, 14, 16, 19. \nTurning to the first assertion, the record does not support that Applicant was in military \nservice in Iraq, but instead that he was a self-employed contractor and independent consultant for \nthe oil industry. GE 2 at 18; GE 10 at 14; GE 3 at 30. Additionally, the record does not support \nthat any alleged memory issues arose from that time period, but that they instead possibly arose \nfrom a stroke that may have occurred at any time during the last several decades. Applicant Exhibit \n(AE) X. \nTurning to the second assertion, Applicant\u2019s disclosure in his second supplemental answer \nto the SOR appears not \u201cunprompted,\u201d as it was made\u2014by his own admission\u2014after receipt of an \nSOR that alleged the same and after Applicant was confronted, via his FOIA request, with the \nGovernment\u2019s evidence that supported the allegation. GE 1 at 3; AE AA. Applicant further \nrepeatedly asserts in his brief that he fully discussed his 2003 charges with an investigator during \na 2008 interview. However, the results of that interview were not admitted into evidence. We find \nno reason to conclude that the Judge erred in his weighing the evidence that Applicant cites. \nPutting aside the various issues with the \u201cmitigating\u201d evidence to which Applicant cites, \nthese portions of Applicant\u2019s brief argue for an alternative interpretation of the record evidence, \nwhich is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge\u2019s findings and conclusions are erroneous. \nApplicant has not rebutted the presumption that the Judge considered all the evidence in the record, \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nnor has he shown the Judge weighed the evidence in a manner that was arbitrary, capricious, or \ncontrary to the law.

The Judge examined \nthe relevant evidence and articulated a satisfactory explanation for the decision. The decision is \nsustainable on this record. \u201cThe general standard is that a clearance may be granted only when \n\u2018clearly consistent with national security.\u2019\u201d Department of the Navy v.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel \nFOR APPLICANT \nMilton C. Johns, Esq. \nThe Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance. On \nApril 1, 2022, DoD issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis of that \ndecision \u2013 security concerns raised under Guideline G (Alcohol Consumption) and Guideline E \n(Personal Conduct) of the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) in Appendix A of \nSecurity Executive Agent Directive 4 (effective June 8, 2017) (SEAD 4) and DoD Directive \n5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive). On August 31, 2023, Defense Office of Hearings \nand Appeals (DOHA) Administrative Judge Bryan J. Olmos denied Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility. Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \nUnder Guidelines G and E, the SOR cross-alleged that Applicant received treatment for \nconditions diagnosed as Alcohol Dependency and Alcohol Use Disorder in 2015, but that she \ndiscontinued treatment against the advice of her providers and continues to consume alcohol \ndespite the diagnoses. The SOR further alleged under Guideline E that Applicant deliberately \nfailed to disclose the 2015 alcohol-related treatment on her 2016 security clearance application \n(SCA), that she falsified material facts regarding her diagnosis in her response to the SOR, and \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nthat she falsified material facts regarding her 2015 treatment and diagnoses during a privately-\nobtained mental health evaluation that was submitted for consideration in her security clearance \nprocessing. The Judge found against Applicant with respect to the allegations that she falsified \nmaterial facts in her 2016 SCA and 2021 alcohol use disorder evaluation, and found in her favor \non the Guideline G and remaining Guideline E concerns. \nFindings of Fact and Analysis \nApplicant is in her late 30s. She earned her bachelor\u2019s degree in 2008 and has held a \nsecurity clearance since 2010. Applicant has been employed by her company since 2015 and \ncurrently works as a business analyst. \nIn about 2014, Applicant began binge drinking due to stress and anxiety stemming from an \nemotionally abusive relationship. She attended counseling with a licensed clinical professional \ncounselor (LCPC) from about April 2014 through February 2015, at which time she changed \nmedical providers and a psychiatrist diagnosed Applicant with generalized anxiety disorder, major \ndepressive disorder, and alcohol dependence, with bipolar disorder ruled out. The psychiatrist also \nopined that Applicant was an addictive shopper and struggled with impulse buying. \nIn March 2015, Applicant was prescribed mood stabilizers and, later, medication to curb \nher alcohol cravings. She received several recommendations to continue the medication to address \nher alcohol dependency. In December 2015, Applicant discussed her struggles with compulsive \nshopping and alcohol abuse with another counselor from the psychiatrist\u2019s practice, who \nrecommended that Applicant continue regular therapy to focus on depression and anxiety \nmanagement, improving her self-esteem, and managing her alcohol consumption and other \ncompulsive behaviors. Applicant did not return for treatment, and she did not participate in mental \nhealth treatment from 2016 through 2018. \nApplicant completed an SCA in 2016, wherein she disclosed that she had received \ncounseling with the LCPC and psychiatrist, but she failed to note that the treatment was alcohol-\nrelated and separately denied ever voluntarily seeking counseling or treatment due to her alcohol \nuse. During a subsequent security clearance interview in February 2018, Applicant described her \nearlier psychological counseling but again failed to note that the counseling was related to her \nvoluntary alcohol treatment. She later relayed to the investigator that she was ashamed to list her \ntreatment for alcohol use and proceeded to describe her period of binge drinking from 2014 to \n2016 and asserted that she successfully completed counseling. \nIn June 2019, in order to address her anxiety regarding relationships, Applicant underwent \na psychiatric evaluation with a physician assistant, certified (PA-C), wherein she described her \nprevious therapy as being related only to her prior abusive relationship. She also relayed having \nbeen diagnosed with acute bipolar disorder and prescribed medications, but that she rarely took \nthem and did not take them seriously, and asserted that she was drinking one alcoholic beverage \nper day. Applicant was thereafter diagnosed with obsessive compulsive disorder, major depressive \ndisorder, and unspecified anxiety disorder, while diagnoses of alcohol abuse disorder and bipolar \ndisorder were ruled out. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nIn September 2019, Applicant returned to the PA-C with complaints of high anxiety related \nto work and personal issues. The related treatment notes contain no indication of alcohol-related \nissues or treatment. Applicant was prescribed medication and a treatment regimen was established, \nboth of which she followed for the next two years, and her anxiety and depression decreased. \nIn her January 2020 response to Government interrogatories, Applicant confirmed her 2015 \nalcohol dependence diagnosis, that she had been prescribed medication to assist with her alcohol \ncravings, and that she had discontinued treatment in 2016 against medical advice. In August 2021, \nafter receiving an initial SOR, Applicant informed the PA-C that her clearance application had \nbeen revoked because she previously saw a psychiatrist in 2015 and was diagnosed with alcohol \nabuse. She reported drinking one or two glasses of wine several nights per week, up to three glasses \non weekends. The PA-C\u2019s assessment and treatment of Applicant remained unchanged and \nunrelated to Applicant\u2019s alcohol consumption. \nAlso in August 2021, Applicant participated in an alcohol use evaluation with a licensed \nclinical social worker (LCSW) wherein she claimed she never sought services associated with \nalcohol while treating with the psychiatrist, and she was adamant that no provider in the \npsychiatrist\u2019s office ever told her that she had a drinking problem or needed alcohol treatment. \nApplicant also claimed that the psychiatrist\u2019s prescription for the alcohol-related medication was \nto curb her desire to shop online and that she only took one or two of the pills but did not like the \nside effects and stopped taking them. She relayed that she had reduced her alcohol consumption \nfrom two-to-four glasses of wine four-to-five times per week, to one-to-two glasses of wine two\u00ad\nto-three times per week. The LCSW concluded that Applicant did not have an alcohol use disorder. \nIn her subsequent August 2021 response to the SOR, Applicant acknowledged having been \ndiagnosed, in part, with alcohol dependence and alcohol use disorder, but asserted those were \noverdiagnoses and that she was only seen a few times by the psychiatrist and discontinued \ntreatment. She claimed that she continued to consume alcohol at a level that her psychiatrist and \ntherapist believed did not meet the criteria for alcohol use disorder. \nIn December 2021, Applicant participated in a psychological evaluation with a licensed \nclinical psychologist wherein she disclosed that she began drinking excessively in 2015 as a coping \nmechanism for her relationship and asserted that she stopped drinking excessively when the \nrelationship ended in 2017. She informed the psychologist that she consumed one or two glasses \nof wine, primarily on the weekends. Applicant was diagnosed with major depressive disorder \n(recurrent, in remission), generalized anxiety disorder, and alcohol use disorder (in remission), and \nbipolar disorder was ruled out. \nIn April and May 2022, the PA-C and another provider from her office issued letters noting \nthat Applicant remained compliant with treatment for major depressive disorder, anxiety disorder, \nand obsessive-compulsive disorder. The second provider opined that Applicant\u2019s symptoms were \nnot related to a substance use disorder. \nApplicant submitted a second response to the SOR in May 2022, wherein she denied having \never received treatment for a condition related to alcohol, and claimed she was only treated for \nanxiety and depression. She asserted that she was unaware of having been diagnosed with alcohol \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nuse disorder or alcohol dependence until well after the fact, and that the medication she was \nprescribed in 2015 was to address her shopping impulses. Applicant also denied providing false \ninformation during her August 2021 alcohol use evaluation. \nAt hearing, Applicant acknowledged seeing the psychiatrist in 2015 for therapy, but denied \nit was due to problems related to alcohol use and again claimed the medication prescribed by the \npsychiatrist was to curb her shopping impulses. Applicant also denied ever being treated for an \nalcohol use disorder or knowing that the psychiatrist diagnosed her with an alcohol use disorder \nuntil she received the SOR; however, when confronted with her January 2020 interrogatory \nresponse that reflected her awareness of the diagnosis and treatment, Applicant claimed she could \nnot remember completing the questionnaire. Applicant was also unable to recall discussing with \nthe psychologist her history of seeking treatment for alcohol abuse during the December 2021 \nevaluation, responding instead that, \u201cI believe it is not who I am anymore, so I understand that the \nrecords say it, but it is not really that prevalent in my memory right now.\u201d Decision at 5, quoting \nTr. 29-32, 39-40. \nWith respect to the unfavorable Guideline E concerns, the Judge found that Applicant\u2019s \nfailure to disclose her voluntary alcohol treatment on her 2016 SCA was a deliberate omission for \nwhich disqualifying condition AG \u00b6 16(a) applied, especially in light of her statement during her \n2018 background interview that she had been ashamed to list the alcohol treatment on her SCA. \nFurther, Applicant asserted during her August 2021 alcohol use evaluation that she never sought \nservices associated with alcohol while treating with the psychiatrist and she was \u201cadamant\u201d that \nneither the psychiatrist nor any therapist in that office ever told her that she had a drinking problem \nor needed treatment for alcohol. These statements, however, were rebutted by her earlier January \n2020 interrogatory response, wherein Applicant confirmed her awareness of her alcohol diagnosis \nand treatment, and her subsequent December 2021 psychological evaluation, wherein she \ndescribed drinking excessively in 2015 and receiving alcohol treatment. Accordingly, the Judge \ndetermined that Applicant deliberately failed to disclose her history of alcohol diagnoses and \ntreatment during her August 2021 evaluation, which warranted application of AG \u00b6 16(b). The \nJudge concluded that Applicant\u2019s significant progress in mental health treatment and overcoming \nthe security concerns about her alcohol consumption did not \u201covercome her refusal to provide a \ncomplete history of her treatment in her SCA or during the security investigation process.\u201d \nDecision at 12. \nDiscussion \nOn appeal, Applicant asserts that the Judge applied the wrong standard in denying her \nsecurity clearance eligibility and failed to properly apply the mitigating conditions. Consistent with \nthe following, we affirm. \nInitial Versus Continuing Security Clearance Determinations \nApplicant\u2019s first argument stems from her position that there is a distinction between the \ndenial of an initial security clearance and the revocation of an existing security clearance, and a \njudge\u2019s failure to recognize that distinction constitutes harmful error. Appeal Brief at 3.

Applicant goes on to assert that the Judge\u2019s \u201cconsideration \nof the facts is made from the posture of merely denying access to an applicant rather than revoking \nexisting access,\u201d which she argues \u201cmakes a legal difference in that denying access would not take \nway [sic] a privilege that is already vested.\u201d Id. Applicant cites no authority for these arguments, \nwhich lack merit for several reasons. \nAs an initial matter, Applicant contends that \u201cthe Agency,\u201d which we presume to mean \nDoD, \u201chas treated the decision to deny her application for a higher clearance level as a revocation \nof her access.\u201d Id. Applicant appears to misunderstand the distinction between possessing a \nsecurity clearance and being granted access to classified material. The issuance of a security \nclearance is a determination that an individual is eligible for access to classified national security \ninformation up to a certain level. While an eligibility determination is generally made at the agency \nlevel and is subject to various regulatory due process requirements, an access determination is \nmost often made at the local level without any due process guarantees. See ISCR Case No. 20\u00ad\n03111 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 10, 2022). Eligibility for access to classified information \u2013 i.e., a \nsecurity clearance \u2013 is an underlying element necessary to an individual subsequently being \ngranted access to classified materials. \nApplicant also attempts to draw a distinction between initial and continued clearance \ndeterminations, arguing that the latter both requires something more than the \u201cclearly consistent\u201d \nstandard and involves a vested interest in a clearance. The Directive, however, recognizes no such \ndistinction. Eligibility for access to classified information will only be granted when the evaluation \nof all information bearing on an individual\u2019s loyalty and allegiance to the United States \ndemonstrates that such eligibility is clearly consistent with the interests of the United States. SEAD \n4 \u00b6 E.4. When DoD \u201ccannot affirmatively find that it is clearly consistent with the national interest \nto grant or continue a security clearance, the case will be referred to DOHA\u201d and, as appropriate, \nassigned to an Administrative Judge to issue a clearance decision. Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.l.l (emphasis \nadded), E3.1.7, E3.1.8. The Administrative Judge is thereafter required to make a written decision \nsetting forth \u201cwhether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a \nsecurity clearance for the applicant.\u201d Directive \u00b6 E3.1.25 (emphasis added). Contrary to \nApplicant\u2019s argument in this regard, the \u201cclearly consistent\u201d standard applies in both initial and \ncontinued (e.g., renewals, higher level applications, etc.) clearance determinations. \nApplicant\u2019s next contention that, because she currently holds a security clearance the \nprivilege is vested, is also unfounded. There is no right to a security clearance, and it has been long \nestablished that a prior favorable security clearance decision does not give rise to a vested right in \nkeeping a security clearance or preclude the Government from reassessing the individual\u2019s security \neligibility in light of current circumstances. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 99-0511 at 8 (App. Bd. Dec. \n19, 2000) (citing Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988)); ISCR Case No. 03\u00ad\n24144 at 6 (App. Bd. Dec. 6, 2005). The prior favorable adjudication of Applicant\u2019s security \neligibility does not entitle her to continued retention of a clearance, nor does it modify the standard \napplicable in security clearance eligibility determinations. \n1 The Judge concluded that \u201c[i]n light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the national interest \nto grant Applicant a security clearance.\u201d Decision at 13. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant also challenges that there is \u201cno discussion of how the Judge\u2019s finding that \n[Applicant] made a deliberate omission in 2016 . . . should require revocation of an existing \nclearance for which she has a spotless record. Appeal Brief at 2. Applicant\u2019s challenge in this \nregard is misplaced, however, as the Directive presumes there is a nexus or rational connection \nbetween proven conduct under any of the Guidelines and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See, \ne.g., DISCR OSD Case No. 92\u20131106, 1993 WL 545051 at *3 (App. Bd. Oct. 7, 1993). \nApplication of Mitigating Conditions \nApplicant also disagrees with the Judge\u2019s weighing of certain evidence and application of \nthe mitigating factors, which is not sufficient to demonstrate that the Judge weighed the evidence \nor reached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. See, e.g., ISCR \nCase No. 06-17409 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2007). For example, she argues that mitigating \ncondition AG \u00b6 17(c) must apply in this case because \u201cthe underlying therapy at issue occurred in \n2014-2015\u201d and \u201cthe original [SCA] was made in 2016.\u201d Appeal Brief at 5. AG \u00b6 17(c) addresses \nthe timing, significance, and circumstances of an applicant\u2019s concerning conduct and affords \nmitigation when \u201cthe offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is so \ninfrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d Applicant appears \nto argue that, because the therapy at issue and the SCA in which she failed to disclose said therapy \nboth occurred years ago, her conduct should be found mitigated through the passage of time. This \nis unpersuasive. \nThe Judge found not only that \u201cApplicant omitted her alcohol treatment history in her July \n2016 SCA,\u201d but that her denials continued throughout her latter security clearance processing, \nincluding that she \u201cdenied any history of alcohol treatment during her August 2021 evaluation \nwith [the LCSW,] further denied any history of alcohol treatment in her May 2022 SOR Answer\u201d \nand, at her May 2023 hearing, \u201cclaimed not to recall her history of alcohol treatment because she \nbelieved it was not who she was anymore and that it was not \u2018prevalent\u2019 in her memory.\u201d Decision \nat 11. The repeated and recent nature of Applicant\u2019s failures to fully disclose information requested \nduring her security clearance investigation undercut any argument that the conduct occurred long \nago. Nor can the omissions be deemed minor insofar as the Directive itself states that failure to \nprovide truthful and candid answers during the security clearance process is of \u201cspecial interest\u201d \nin evaluating an applicant\u2019s security worthiness.

He claimed that \nthe omission was an unintentional mistake. The Judge did not find this claim credible. In making \nthe state-of-mind determination, the Judge noted that the entire record should be examined and \nthat circumstantial evidence could be considered. The Judge concluded, \u201c[Applicant] should have \nbeen sensitive to the issue of his cocaine involvement because of his arrest, prosecution, probation, \ndrug treatment, and effort to have the incident expunged. A reasonable inference is that he realized \nthat disclosure of his drug treatment may have led to follow-up questions during his [background \ninvestigation] about his involvement with illegal drugs.\u201d Decision at 10. The Judge further \nconcluded that Applicant\u2019s failure to admit that he committed this falsification established an \nunwillingness to accept responsibility and detracted from a favorable reform or rehabilitation \ndetermination. \nApplicant argues that the Judge\u2019s analysis was defective. He contends that the Judge erred \nin the credibility determination and state-of-mind evaluation. We do not find these arguments \npersuasive. The Appeal Board is required to give deference to a judge\u2019s credibility determinations. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.32.1. We find no reason not to give such deference in this case. Furthermore, \nwe find no error either in the Judge\u2019s analysis regarding this allegation or in his conclusion that \nApplicant continued denial of committing this falsification shows a lack of rehabilitation. See, \ne.g., ISCR Case No. 03-22819 at 4 (App. Bd. Mar. 20, 2006), reversing grant of a security \nclearance where the judge concluded that the applicant falsified her SCA\u2e3adespite the applicant\u2019s \ntestimony at hearing that the omission was unintentional\u2e3abut ultimately found that the security \nconcern resulting from the falsification was mitigated. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nCocaine Charge Allegations \nApplicant attributed his failure to disclose the cocaine-related charge on his 2004 and 2014 \nSCAs to his then-attorney verbally advising him \u201cif he was asked on a job application about being \ncharged, he \u2018could truthfully answer no, that it never happened.\u2019\u201d Decision at 3, citing Tr. at 34\u00ad\n35. In concluding that Mitigating Condition (MC) 17(b) did not apply, the Judge stated that \n\u201cApplicant admitted that his counsel\u2019s advice was not \u2018specifically concerning the security \nprocesses.\u2019\u201d Decision at 9 (emphasis in original). On appeal, Applicant argues the Judge erred in \nhis narrow interpretation of MC 17(b) which states: \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was caused or \nsignificantly contributed to by advice of legal counsel or of a person with \nprofessional responsibilities for advising or instructing the individual specifically \nconcerning security processes. Upon being made aware of the requirement to \ncooperate or provide the information, the individual cooperated fully and \ntruthfully[.] [Directive, Encl. 2, App. A \u00b6 17(b).] \nApplicant contends that the phrase \u201cspecifically concerning security processes\u201d does not \nqualify the advice of legal counsel, but rather is meant only to identify the persons in the latter \ncategory, i.e., security professionals. We agree with Applicant\u2019s interpretation and find that the \nJudge erred in concluding that MC 17(b) only applied to an attorney\u2019s advice that specifically \nconcerns security processes. For the following reasons, however, we conclude that the Judge\u2019s \nerror was harmless in this case. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 11-15184 at 3 (App. Bd. Jul. 25, 2013) \n(an error is harmless if it does not likely affect the outcome of the case). \nIn falsification cases, the key issue is usually whether the omission of required information \non an SCA was deliberate. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 21-01570 at 2 (App. Bd. Dec. 12, 2022) (\u201cIn \norder to prove a deliberate SCA omission, an applicant must have understood the question at issue \nand must have knowingly failed to disclose requested information.\u201d). In evaluating whether the \nGovernment has presented substantial evidence regarding the deliberate nature of a false statement \nor an omission, the administrative judge \u201cmust examine the statement or omission in light of the \nrecord as a whole.\u201d ISCR Case No. 07-03307 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 26, 2008). When an applicant \nclaims that the omission was not deliberate, \u201cthe Judge should address explicitly any contrary \nevidence in the record.\u201d Id. \nAlthough he misstates the parameters of MC 17(b), the Judge\u2019s analysis reflects that he \nproperly considered the mitigating condition before concluding that it did not apply. The Judge \naddressed Applicant\u2019s testimony that he relied upon the advice of an attorney when he omitted \ninformation about his cocaine arrest from his 2004 and 2014 SCAs. The Judge concluded, \nhowever, that Applicant\u2019s purported reliance on that advice was unreasonable considering that \n\u201cApplicant\u2019s 2004 and 2014 SCAs asked clear and easily understood questions about Applicant\u2019s \nrecord of charges,\u201d and that \u201cApplicant has a bachelor\u2019s degree, and his character evidence \nestablishes that [he] is exceptionally intelligent.\u201d Decision at 8. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 18-01564 \nat 3 (App. Bd. May 30, 2019) (evidence regarding an applicant\u2019s level of education and the clarity \nof the questions at issue supported the judge\u2019s finding that the applicant deliberately falsified his \nSCA). Based on those factors, the Judge concluded that Applicant understood that he was required \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nto disclose the drug charge on his SCAs. Decision at 8. The Judge\u2019s finding regarding Applicant\u2019s \nstate of mind and falsification of the cocaine charge is supported by \u201csuch relevant evidence as a \nreasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary \nevidence in the same record.\u201d ISCR Case No. 17-02145 at 3 (App. Bd. Sep. 10, 2018). \nFurthermore, the Judge\u2019s misstatement of MC 17(b) is also harmless because Applicant\u2019s \nfalsification regarding his drug treatment was a sufficient basis independently to support the \nrevocation of his security clearance eligibility. \nWeighing of the Evidence \nApplicant contends that the Judge mis-weighed the evidence. For example, he argues that, \nhad the Judge correctly evaluated all the evidence, he would have found Applicant\u2019s explanation \ncredible and determined that Applicant\u2019s omissions were mitigated because he later made prompt, \ngood-faith disclosures before being confronted with the omissions and because of the passage of \ntime and unlikeness of recurrence. Furthermore, he asserts that the Judge failed to draw any \nconclusion regarding Applicant\u2019s state of mind. We do not find these arguments persuasive.  \nRegarding that latter argument, the Judge specifically found that Disqualifying Condition 16(a), \n\u201cdeliberate omission . . . of relevant facts from any personnel security questionnaire . . . used to \n. . . determine national security eligibility\u201d applied. Decision at 7. See also Directive, Encl. 2, \nApp. A \u00b6 16(a). In general, none of Applicant\u2019s arguments are sufficient to rebut the presumption \nthat the Judge considered all of the evidence in the record or to demonstrate that the Judge weighed \nthe evidence in a matter that was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. See, e.g., ISCR Case \nNo. 21-01169 at 5 (App. Bd. May 13, 2022). \nConclusion \nApplicant failed to establish that the Judge committed any harmful error. The Judge \nexamined the relevant evidence and articulated a satisfactory explanation for the decision.

Applicant requested a hearing. On \nJanuary 31, 2023, after the record closed, Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) \nAdministrative Judge LeRoy F.

The Judge found against Applicant on both allegations. On appeal, Applicant \nasserts that the Judge failed to properly consider all available evidence, rendering his adverse \ndecision arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law, and failed to properly apply the mitigating \nconditions and whole-person analysis.

He has worked for Defense contractors since the late 1990s \nand has held a security clearance since 2001. Applicant earned his bachelor\u2019s degree in 2005 and \nhas taken courses towards a master\u2019s degree. As of the hearing, his salary was approximately \n$130,000 per year. \nIn his 2019 security clearance application and interview, Applicant disclosed failing to file \nhis Federal and state tax returns for tax years 2012 through 2018. He subsequently explained that \nhis tax problems began when his home went to foreclosure in 2009. The sale resulted in a mortgage \ndeficiency balance for which he received a Form 1099 from the lender forgiving the deficiency, \nbut Applicant did not know how to report the amount on his return and believed it would result in \na tax debt. Although he was advised to consult with a tax professional to ensure his returns were \nfiled correctly, he declined and instead simply did not file. \nAs of the hearing, Applicant\u2019s 2012 through 2017, 2020, and 2021 Federal returns \nremained unfiled. IRS tax transcripts reflected that his Federal returns for 2018 and 2019 were \nreceived by the IRS in May 2020, and that he owed balances of approximately $3,600 and $1,000 \nfor these tax years, respectively. He estimated owing approximately $100,000 in Federal taxes. \nWith respect to his state taxes, Applicant did not produce any evidence to prove that his delinquent \nstate returns were filed. In January 2022, however, he entered into a payment agreement for his \nstate tax debt, which required monthly payments of $2,000 beginning in February. His bank \nstatements reflected four state tax payments in varying amounts made between March and August \n2022. \nThe Judge found that none of the mitigating conditions was fully applicable. Applicant\u2019s \ntax filing failures were numerous and recent, and he failed to establish that recurrence was unlikely. \nNor did he establish that his tax problems resulted from circumstances beyond his control. He had \njust begun to resolve his Federal filing deficiencies and had not demonstrated a track record of \ncompliance. Although Applicant had a plan in place to resolve his state tax problems and had taken \nsteps to carry out that plan, it remained unclear if all his state tax returns were filed. Additionally, \nwhile Applicant engaged the services of a tax professional, it was still too early to find clear \nindications that the tax problems were under control. The Judge concluded that, in consideration \nof the foregoing, Applicant had \u201cnot yet reached the point where he has demonstrated rehabilitation \nsufficient to overcome the security concerns raised by his conduct.\u201d Decision at 8. \nDiscussion \nApplicant has not challenged any of the Judge\u2019s specific findings of fact. Rather, he \ncontends that the Judge erred in failing to comply with the provisions in Executive Order 10865 \nand the Directive by not considering all the evidence, and by not properly applying the mitigating \nconditions and Whole-Person Concept. For example, Applicant argues that the Judge \u201cdid not \nplace appropriate weight on . . . the good faith efforts made and [the] articulated plan to file his \npast tax returns and pay off his tax debt.\u201d Appeal Brief at 5. However, the Judge\u2019s determination \nthat Applicant did not make an agreement to resolve his delinquent state taxes until after the \nhearing and had still not filed the majority of his Federal returns is supported by the record, as is \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nhis conclusion that Applicant had not demonstrated rehabilitation sufficient to overcome the \nsecurity concerns raised by his conduct. Decision at 8. Applicant\u2019s arguments, implicitly and \nexplicitly, advocate for an alternative weighing of the evidence, which is not enough to show that \nthe Judge weighed the evidence or reached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, \nor contrary to law. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-17409 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2007).1 \nApplicant also contends that the Judge did not weigh and consider all relevant evidence in \napplying the whole-person concept. In doing so, he asserts that, although the Judge \u201cspeaks to \nseveral favorable factors in [Applicant\u2019s] case specifically his military service, strong statements \nof support, and candid, sincere testimony which speak to the whole-person concept, it made no \ndifference in the outcome of [Applicant\u2019s] case even though Judge Foreman could\u2019ve found \nfavorably solely on the whole person concept.\u201d Appeal Brief at 12. Applicant\u2019s own argument \nundercuts his suggestion that the Judge\u2019s whole-person analysis was lacking. Rather, the Judge \nclearly considered Applicant\u2019s military service, his personal and professional accomplishments \nand recommendations, and his candor at hearing. Decision at 8. Applicant\u2019s position in this regard \namounts to a duplicative argument that the Judge incorrectly weighed mitigating evidence, which, \nas discussed above, is insufficient to establish error. \nFinally, Applicant\u2019s brief relies on hearing-level decisions in unrelated Guideline F cases \nto argue that the Judge erred in his analysis of this case. His reliance on those decisions is \nmisplaced. As the Board has previously stated, how particular fact scenarios were decided at the \nhearing level in other cases is generally not a relevant consideration in our review of a case. See, \ne.g., ISCR Case No. 19-02593 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 18, 2021), setting forth a lengthier discussion \nof this issue. On appeal, Hearing Office decisions may be useful to highlight a novel legal \nprinciple; but only in rare situations \u2013 such as separate cases involving spouses, cohabitants, or \npartners in which the debts and the financial circumstances surrounding them are the same \u2013 would \nthe adjudication outcome in another case have any meaningful relevance in our review of a case. \nThe decisions that Applicant cites have no direct relationship or unique link to Applicant\u2019s case \nthat would make them relevant here. See also ISCR Case No. 19-03174 at 2 (App. Bd. Feb. 10, \n2021). \nOur review of the record and Decision confirms that the Judge considered and discussed \nthose issues highlighted by Applicant on appeal and complied with the requirements of the \nDirective in his whole-person analysis by considering the totality of the evidence in reaching his \ndecision. Applicant failed to establish that the Judge committed any harmful error or that he should \nbe granted any relief on appeal. The Judge examined the relevant evidence and articulated a \nsatisfactory explanation for the decision. The decision is sustainable on this record. \u201cThe general \nstandard is that a clearance may be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests of the \nnational security.\u2019\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). \u201cAny doubt \nconcerning personnel being considered for national security eligibility will be resolved in favor of \nthe national security.\u201d Directive, Encl. 2, App. A \u00b6 2(b). \n1 \u201cThe application of disqualifying and mitigating conditions does not turn simply on a finding that one or more of \nthem apply to the particular facts of a case. Rather, their application requires the exercise of sound discretion in light \nof the record evidence as a whole. Thus, the presence of some mitigating evidence does not alone compel the Judge \nto make a favorable security clearance decision. As the trier of fact, the Judge has to weigh the evidence as a whole \nand decide whether the favorable evidence outweighs the unfavorable evidence, or vice versa.\u201d Id.

Department \nCounsel\u2019s arguments are of mixed merit. \nIn deciding whether the Judge\u2019s rulings or conclusions are arbitrary and capricious, we will \nreview the Judge\u2019s decision to determine whether: it does not examine relevant evidence; it fails \n2 \n\n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nto articulate a satisfactory explanation for its conclusions, including a rational connection between \nthe facts found and the choice made; it does not consider relevant factors; it reflects a clear error \nof judgment; it fails to consider an important aspect of the case; it offers an explanation for the \ndecision that runs contrary to the record evidence; or it is so implausible that it cannot be ascribed \nto a mere difference of opinion. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 20-01450 at 3 (App. Bd. Jun. 9, 2022). \nErrors in Department Counsel\u2019s Facts \nBecause she contends that the Judge\u2019s findings of fact contain significant errors, \nDepartment Counsel submitted her own statement of the facts and based her arguments on those \nfacts. However, several of Department Counsel\u2019s facts are not supported by the record, to \ninclude: \nDepartment Counsel asserts that Applicant\u2019s 2004 tax account transcript reflects a balance \nof $0.00 only because he was in a Currently Not Collectable (CNC) status and argues that the \nJudge failed to address or consider Applicant\u2019s ongoing 2004 arrearage. In fact, the tax account \ntranscript indicates that Applicant satisfied the 2004 delinquency entirely by May 2019 through \npayments and tax refunds, paying a total of about $9,300 in principal, interest, and penalties on the \nalleged $4,700 debt. Applicant\u2019s Exhibit (AE) A at 11\u201313 and SOR Response at 11\u201313. \nDepartment Counsel asserts that Applicant made no payments towards his Federal tax \ndelinquency for 2005 prior to the IRS writing it off in January 2020. In fact, the tax account \ntranscript indicates a payment via tax refund of about $2,200 in April 2019. Id. at 14\u201316. \nDepartment Counsel does not dispute that Applicant has satisfied the terms of his Offer in \nCompromise to the IRS that covered his tax obligations for TYs 2006 \u2013 2009, 2011, 2012, 2014, \nand 2017. Nevertheless, Department Counsel repeatedly asserts that Applicant has not proven \nthat he filed his delinquent Federal returns for those tax years. Appeal Brief at 5, 11, and 17. \n\u201c[T]here is no evidence that any of the delinquent returns were actually prepared and filed with \nthe IRS.\u201d Id. at 12. She argues that it is \u201cmere speculation\u201d that the delinquent returns were filed \nand that the Judge erred in concluding that they were. Id. \nAs Department Counsel herself stated at the hearing, \u201ca condition of the offer in \ncompromise is to have filed all of one\u2019s income tax returns.\u201d \nTr. at 48. See also \nhttps://www.irs.gov/payments/offer-in-compromise. \nIndeed, at hearing, Department Counsel \nconceded that \u201cthe letter from the IRS, saying that the offer in compromise was accepted and \nsatisfied\u201d was some evidence that the tax returns were filed. Tr. at 48. To assert on appeal that \n\u201cthe record does not contain any documentary evidence demonstrating that the returns were . . . \nfiled\u201d (Appeal Brief at 17) is puzzling. Applicant\u2019s exhibits document his satisfaction of the Offer \nin Compromise and the release of the 2019 Federal tax lien and support the Judge\u2019s finding that \nthe Federal returns were filed. AE B and C. \nRegarding Applicant\u2019s medical debts, Department Counsel asserts that Applicant has not \nprovided evidence that medical accounts are being addressed through his payment plan; that he \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n   \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nhas provided evidence of only six payments to a credit counseling service between 2018 and 2022 \ntotaling about $700; and that only one medical debt (SOR \u00b6 1.l) is documented as being on the \nplan, having been added after the hearing. Appeal Brief at 7 and 8. Instead, the record confirms \nthat 13 medical accounts were on Applicant\u2019s original payment plan and that he made 58 payments \nbetween July 2018 and December 2020 alone, totaling approximately $9,000. Answer to SOR at \n20\u201321, 25\u201326. Moreover, the record confirms that\u2014at a minimum\u2014the debts alleged at SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.o and 1.p were added to the original payment plan in February 2021, after the SOR was issued. \nAnswer to SOR at 1, 24; AE D at 2, 4. \nErrors in Judge\u2019s Findings of Fact and Analysis \nAlthough Department Counsel\u2019s arguments are clouded by the errors highlighted above, \nseveral of her arguments are meritorious in that she highlights the following aspects of the case \nthat the Judge failed to consider or address. \nFirst, with regard to the Federal tax allegations, the Judge simply stated in his Analysis that \nApplicant had addressed his delinquent Federal income taxes and filed all required returns. The \nJudge failed to address Applicant\u2019s lengthy and troubled Federal tax history to include: \n\uf0b7 Applicant\u2019s failure to pay his delinquent tax debt for 2004 until it was ultimately \nresolved in 2019 by tax refunds; \n\uf0b7 Applicant\u2019s failure to pay his delinquent tax debt for 2005 until it was largely \nwritten off in 2020; and \n\uf0b7 Applicant\u2019s failure to file tax returns, as required, for TYs 2006 \u2013 2013 and 2015 \nuntil sometime after hiring a tax relief company in November 2017 and prior to \nsubmitting his December 2019 Offer in Compromise. \nSecond, with regard to the state tax allegations, the Judge again simply stated that \nApplicant had addressed his state income taxes and \u201cfiled all the required tax returns.\u201d Decision \nat 5. The Judge failed to consider or address: \n\uf0b7 The fact that Applicant did not file state returns for the alleged years and that instead \nthe state ultimately filed substitute returns; and \n\uf0b7 The fact that Applicant\u2019s state tax debts were resolved involuntarily through the \nlevy of his bank account and garnishment of his wages. Tr. at 32\u201333. \nThird, with regard to the medical debts, the Judge failed to articulate how he determined \nthat the delinquent medical debts alleged were all on Applicant\u2019s payment plan. The evidence \nestablishes that Applicant entered two of the debts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.o and 1.p) into his payment plan \nafter receipt of the SOR and one of the debts (SOR \u00b6 1.l) after his hearing.

When analyzing a case, \na Judge must consider the evidence as a whole and not view it in an isolated or piecemeal manner \nthat focuses only on matters favorable to one party. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-05005 at 8 (App. \nBd. Sep. 15, 2017). In this case, the Judge erred by failing to analyze the significant matters \nhighlighted above and failing to articulate a satisfactory explanation for his conclusions. \nAdditionally, the Judge failed to identify the specific mitigating conditions that applied, \ninstead simply noting that five mitigating conditions were potentially applicable.2 The Judge\u2019s \nbrief analysis leaves us guessing which mitigating conditions he concluded either fully or partially \napplied and the rationale for making those determinations. \nThis was error. \nAs we have \npreviously stated, the Judge\u2019s decision must be written in a manner that allows the parties and the \nBoard to discern what findings the Judge is making and what conclusions he or she is reaching. \nSee, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-00944 at 4\u20135, n.4 (App. Bd. Feb. 15, 2019). \nGiven these circumstances, we conclude that the best resolution of this case is to remand \nthe case to the Judge to correct the identified errors in his findings of fact and analysis. Upon \nremand, a Judge is required to issue a new decision. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.35. The Board retains no \njurisdiction over a remanded decision. However, the Judge\u2019s decision issued after remand may \nbe appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.130. Other issues in the case are not ripe for \nconsideration at this time. \n1 The debt alleged at SOR \u00b6 1.k. is a duplicate of SOR \u00b61.i.

Under Guideline E, the SOR alleged \nthat Applicant was investigated by his employer in 2016 for using his company email to correspond \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nwith foreign women whom he met on online dating sites; that he took out personal loans to wire \nfunds to a woman living abroad whom he met on a dating website; that he was fired by his \nemployer in 2018 for mischarging time; and that he falsified material facts regarding being \nterminated during his background interview in 2019. Under Guideline F, the SOR alleges eight \ndelinquent debts totaling approximately $72,000.  \nTo the extent that we understand Applicant\u2019s argument on appeal, he contends that the \nAdministrative Judge was incorrect on some of his findings of fact because no one had talked to \nApplicant since his background interview in early 2019 to \u201cconfirm the supposed facts.\u201d Appeal \nBrief at 1. We note first that Applicant was provided the opportunity in May 2020 to review the \nsummaries of his multiple interviews with background investigators and that he adopted those \nsummaries as accurate.  GE 4 at 16.  Second, we note that Applicant was provided an opportunity \nto respond to the FORM and availed himself of that opportunity. Finally, we note that the only \nerror that Applicant highlights is that he has held a security clearance since 1997 vice 2001. Appeal \nBrief at 1. This was a harmless error as it did not likely have an impact on the outcome of the \ncase.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 19-01220 at 3 (App. Bd. Jun. 1, 2020).  \nBesides that error, Applicant\u2019s appeal brief makes no other assertion of harmful error on \nthe part of the Judge. Instead, Applicant re-states information regarding the alleged online \nrelationships, his 2018 termination, and his debts that was previously provided to the Judge in \nApplicant\u2019s answer to the SOR and his response to the FORM. The Appeal Board does not review \ncases de novo. Our authority to review a case is limited to cases in which the appealing party has \nalleged the Judge committed harmful error. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 18-01962 at 2 (App. Bd. \nAug. 29, 2019). Because Applicant has not alleged any harmful error, the decision of the Judge \ndenying Applicant a security clearance is sustainable.  \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nOrder \nThe decision is AFFIRMED. \nSigned: James F.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel \nFOR APPLICANT \nPro Se \nThe Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance. On \nAugust 17, 2021, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for that \ndecision \u2013 security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of the National \nSecurity Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) in Appendix A of Security Executive Agent Directive 4 \n(effective June 8, 2017) and DoD Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive). \nApplicant requested a hearing. On August 1, 2023, Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals \nAdministrative Judge Eric C. Price denied Applicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility. Applicant \nappealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \nThe SOR alleged 29 delinquent debts totaling approximately $85,000. The Judge found \nagainst Applicant on 25 allegations, and in his favor on four allegations. On appeal, Applicant \nargues the Judge improperly weighed the evidence and failed to consider relevant evidence in \nmitigation by claiming the Judge was unaware of certain mitigating conditions and did not consider \npayments made on debts since the SOR was issued. Consistent with the following, we affirm. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nJudge\u2019s Findings and Analysis \nApplicant is in his mid-30s and holds bachelor\u2019s and master\u2019s degrees. He is married and \nhas three children. He has worked for his current employer since 2018 and has never held security \nclearance eligibility. \nThe Judge found that much of Applicant\u2019s debt arose from a failed business he financed \nwith personal, unsecured credit. He financed about $59,000 for the business that remained open \nfor less than a year. Upon the failure of the business, Applicant said he hired a debt-consolidation \ncompany in 2017 to address about $38,000 in unsecured debt, and he made payments for about \ntwo years in accordance with the agreement. When the company ceased business in his state, he \nsettled some debts on his own, and had some accounts removed from his credit report. \nAfter being notified of the importance of resolving delinquent debts during his security \neligibility investigation, Applicant hired a second credit repair company in March 2021. As of \nMarch 2023, 12 SOR accounts were enrolled at 0%, one account was enrolled at 100%, one \naccount was paid in full, and one account was being \u201creworked.\u201d Applicant had deposited about \n$11,000 into the plan and was scheduled to make two deposits of about $427 in March, and one in \nApril 2023. According to Applicant, the agreement required recurring deposits of $840 per month \nfor 60 months. \nThe Judge found that Applicant has not made the full payments of $840 per month since \nbeginning the program and failed to submit sufficient documentary evidence of resolution of his \ndebts, payments to the credit-consolidation company, or evidence showing the actions of a credit \nrepair company. He noted that debts that were removed from a credit report do not necessarily \nreflect satisfactory resolution, and there is insufficient evidence of contacts with creditors or other \nefforts to resolve debts. Although the Judge credited Applicant with hiring the second credit repair \ncompany to address 15 of the SOR debts, and for payments toward other debts that were resolved, \nthe timing of his actions, limited details of the agreement, and discrepancies between his claimed \npayments and documented payments were insufficient to fully establish that he has adhered to a \ngood faith effort to resolve delinquent debts. \nDiscussion \nOn appeal, Applicant contends the Judge was unaware of or did not appropriately consider \nmitigating evidence of his use of debt consolidation and repair companies to resolve his debt and \ndid not consider the debts he resolved since issuance of the SOR. Applicant\u2019s challenges to the \nJudge\u2019s findings include to a large measure a disagreement with the manner in which the Judge \nweighed the evidence. Applicant mischaracterizes the Judge\u2019s statements during the hearing as a \nlack of understanding of the mitigating conditions with regard to debt resolution efforts. \nSpecifically, we find no basis for Applicant\u2019s contention that the Judge did not know that \na debt resolution program was an acceptable way of resolving debts under Guideline F mitigating \nconditions. The record reflects that the Judge painstakingly reviewed the mitigating conditions \nwith Applicant in light of the evidence submitted at the hearing and suggested further \ndocumentation that Applicant could submit to bolster his case in mitigation. See, e.g., Tr. at 69\u00ad\n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n86. To the extent that Applicant is contending the Judge mis-weighed or did not consider record \nevidence, we find no merit in those assertions. None of his arguments are enough to rebut the \npresumption that the Judge considered all of the record evidence or to demonstrate the Judge \nweighed the evidence in a manner that was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. See, e.g., \nISCR Case No. 21-01169 at 5 (App. Bd. May 13, 2022). \nThe Judge correctly cited ISCR Case No. 14-05803 at 3 (App. Bd. Jul. 7, 2016) for the \nproposition that the absence of debts on a recent credit report is not meaningful evidence of debt \nresolution because debts may be removed for various reasons such as the passage of time. It is also \nwell established that an applicant\u2019s ongoing, unpaid debts demonstrate a continuing course of \nconduct and can be viewed as recent for purposes of the Guideline F mitigating conditions. See, \ne.g., ISCR Case No. 15-06532 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 16, 2017). Moreover, the Board has held that \nuntil an applicant has a meaningful financial track record, it cannot be said as a matter of law that \nhe has initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolved debts. The \nphrase \u201cmeaningful track record\u201d necessarily includes evidence of actual debt reduction through \npayment on debts. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 05-01920 at 5 (App. Bd. Mar. 1, 2007). Promises to \npay off delinquent debts in the future are not a substitute for a track record of timely debt payments \nand otherwise acting in a financially responsible manner. See, e.g., ADP Case No. 07-13041 at 4 \n(App. Bd. Sep. 19, 2008). \nApplicant failed to establish that the Judge committed any harmful error or that he should \nbe granted any relief on appeal. The Judge examined the relevant evidence and articulated a \nsatisfactory explanation for the decision. The decision is sustainable on the record. \u201cThe general \nstandard is that a clearance may be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests of the \nnational security.\u2019\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).

Applicant appealed \npursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \nUnder Guideline D, the SOR alleged that from about 2014 to at least December 2018, while \nhe held a security clearance and sensitive compartmented information (SCI) access eligibility, \nApplicant patronized sex workers on numerous occasions at various locations around the world, \nand that, on occasion, he engaged in sexual activity with persons of unknown citizenship or of \nknown foreign citizenship.

Consistent with the following, we affirm. \nThe Judge\u2019s Findings of Fact \nApplicant is in his early thirties, single, with no children. He earned a bachelor\u2019s degree \nin 2014. Applicant has served honorably in the U.S. military from 2009 to the present; he currently \nserves in a reserve status. He worked for defense contractors from August 2015 to December \n2018. Applicant has held a clearance during all times alleged in the SOR and was granted top \nsecret/SCI access in 2015. \nIn March 2019, Applicant consented to a polygraph examination in the course of applying \nfor a position with a U.S. government agency. During his pre-test interview, he disclosed \nnumerous interactions with sex workers in the United States and overseas. Specifically, Applicant \ndisclosed: in State X in 2014 and 2015, he solicited prostitutes in a strip club on approximately 20 \noccasions and engaged in sexual activity in massage parlors; in Canada in 2016, he engaged in \nsexual activity with prostitutes; in State Y in 2018, he paid for sex at a strip club; in a Southeast \nAsian country in 2018, he engaged in numerous sexual encounters in several locations; in Europe \nin June 2018, he went to \u201cbrothels\u201d in two different countries and engaged in sex with several \nwomen within each brothel on seven separate occasions; and in December 2018, he returned to \none of those countries, and solicited prostitutes on four separate occasions.  Decision at 3.   \nFollowing these disclosures, the examiner terminated the interview. Applicant gained \nemployment with his current employer, a defense contractor, in April 2019. \nAfter completing his security clearance application in 2019, Applicant was interviewed by \na background investigator. He confirmed the information he had provided in his polygraph pre\u00ad\ninterview. He stated that he believed prostitution was legal in some of the countries at issue. He \nreported that one friend was aware of his sexual activities in Canada and another friend was aware \nof the trip to Europe in June 2019. He indicated that no one knew about his sexual activities abroad \nin March 2018 and December 2018. \nRegarding his use of prostitutes in the United States, Applicant stated that he did not \nconsider whether his conduct was illegal. The friend with whom he traveled to Europe in June \n2018 was also aware that Applicant paid for sex at a strip club in State X, but otherwise no one \nwas aware of his commercial sexual encounters in State X and State Y. \nAt hearing, Applicant estimated that he patronized sex workers 40 times between 2014 and \nDecember 2018 and denied any further incidences. When he patronized sex workers in State X in \n2014 and 2015, he believed that his conduct was legal because the sexual activity took place in a \nclub, which was a legal establishment. \u201cApplicant believes that paying for sex with a dancer in a \nstrip club is different from hiring a prostitute in a brothel in that a strip club is not an establishment \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nwhose sole purposed is to provide sexual services to its patrons.\u201d Decision at 5. Regarding his \nsexual activities with sex workers abroad, Applicant did not believe that conduct was illegal \nbecause he believed prostitution to be legal in most countries other than the United States.  \nApplicant testified that friends and colleagues knew that he patronized sex workers abroad \nand that other soldiers knew about his visits to the strip club. He stated that he told his supervisor \nand FSO that his SOR involved prostitution, but that he did not provide details or give them a copy \nof the SOR. He has told his family that he engaged in prostitution. The friends and colleagues \nwho provided character letters for him know that the SOR alleges prostitution. He has not made \nthem aware of any details, including about the nature or extent, as he \u201cconsiders it a personal matter \nand does not see a need to provide details.\u201d Decision at 8.  \nUnder State X\u2019s laws, procurement of a commercial sexual activity is a misdemeanor \noffense, punishable by fines and imprisonment. Under State Y\u2019s law, commercial sexual activity \nis a misdemeanor offense for the first two offenses and a felony in the case of a third or subsequent \nviolation.  \nThe United States has a \u201czero-tolerance policy\u201d regarding government employees and \ncontractor personnel engaging in trafficking in persons. Decision at 6. Pursuant to an Executive \nOrder issued in 2012, federal contractors and their employees are prohibited from engaging in \ntrafficking-related activities, to include \u201cthe procurement of commercial sex acts.\u201d Id. at 6. As a \nmember of the U.S. military, Applicant had annual training on combating trafficking in persons \n(CTIP) since 2011, but he denied any recollection that his training specifically mentioned not \npaying for sexual conduct. Id. at 7. \nThe Judge\u2019s Analysis \nGuideline D \nBetween 2014 and December 2018, Applicant patronized sex workers in two U.S. states \nand four foreign countries an estimated 40 times, while holding a DoD security clearance. When \nhe paid for sex in strip clubs in State X, he was a member of the U.S. military. When he patronized \nsex workers abroad in 2018, he was a member of the military and a defense-contractor employee. \nHis patronizing of sex workers was in violation of U.S. policies and regulations and illegal in both \nStates X and Y. \nHis conduct primarily establishes two disqualifying conditions under Adjudicative \nGuideline (AG) \u00b6 13: (a) sexual behavior of a criminal nature, whether or not the individual has \nbeen prosecuted, and (c) sexual behavior that causes an individual to be vulnerable to coercion, \nexploitation, or duress. Additionally, Applicant exhibited a lack of judgment under AG \u00b6 13(d), \nsexual behavior of a public nature or that reflects a lack of discretion or judgment, by engaging in \nconduct in massage parlors and strip clubs that could have led to his arrest.  Decision at 10.  \nNone of the mitigating conditions are sufficiently established. There is no evidence that \nApplicant has patronized a sex worker after December 2018, but his sexual behavior was frequent \nand intentional. It was in violation of U.S. policies and regulations and state laws prohibiting \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nsolicitation of prostitution. Applicant has not had any treatment or counseling. \u201cThe extent to \nwhich he patronized sex workers . . . makes it difficult to rule out the risk of recurrence based \nsolely on his assertion that it will not happen again.\u201d Id. at 11. \nAs of January 2020, only two friends knew about instances in which Applicant had \npatronized sex workers. Applicant had withheld his involvement with sex workers from his \nmilitary superiors and civilian employer. He now asserts that his supervisor, his FSO, and his \nimmediate family are aware that he engaged in prostitution, but he admits that he provided no \ndetails to them. Applicant has not adequately established that his behavior no longer serves as a \nbasis for coercion, exploitation, or duress.  \nGuideline J \nThere is insufficient evidence to conclude that Applicant\u2019s sexual activities with prostitutes \noverseas were criminal in any of the four foreign countries in which it occurred. However, the \nevidence establishes that Applicant\u2019s sexual activities in State X and State Y were criminal.  \nAlthough Applicant\u2019s contributions to his present employer and his decorated military service \nreflect some rehabilitation, his assertion that he thought his conduct was legal and his attempts to \ndraw a distinction between paying for sex in a strip club and hiring a prostitute in a brothel indicate \na lack of reform.  \nGuideline E \nSoliciting sex with prostitutes, especially with foreign sex workers abroad \non numerous occasion, is information that could adversely affect Applicant\u2019s \nstanding among his family, friends, fellow service members, and co-workers.  The \nfact that he held a DOD TS clearance and SCI access eligibility while he was paying \nfor sex in brothels and prostitution houses overseas is an aggravating factor.  \n. \n. \n. \nGiven Applicant\u2019s experience in military intelligence, he can reasonably \nhave been expected to understand that the risk posed by paying for sex with \nunknown women abroad went beyond any personal health or safety considerations \nand made him vulnerable to exploitation, manipulation, or duress. In that regard, \nhis repeated involvement with sex workers cannot be considered so minor as to not \nraise security concerns.  Moreover, as previously discussed it was repeated and did \nnot happen under unique circumstances. . . . [H]e has disclosed little of his \ninvolvement with prostitutes to those persons who matter in his personal and \nprofessional life.  [Id. at 13\u201314.] \nDiscussion \nApplicant has not challenged any of the Judge\u2019s specific findings of fact. Rather, he \ncontends that the Judge erred in three regards: first, under Guidelines D, J, and E, she failed to \napply the mitigation evidence that she considered favorably under Guideline B; second, she failed \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \nto consider that Applicant did not recognize that his activities were prohibited or illegal; and third, \nshe failed in her mitigation and whole-person analysis. Consequently, Applicant argues, the \nJudge\u2019s decision was arbitrary, capricious, and contrary to law. \nWe turn first to the distinction between the Judge\u2019s findings on Guideline B and Guideline \nD. As the Judge explained, Applicant\u2019s relations with the sex workers overseas did not present a \nheightened risk of foreign exploitation, pressure, or coercion, nor did they create a potential \nconflict of interest: his contacts were with random women in countries friendly to the United \nStates, he knew little to nothing about their backgrounds, and he did not see them again. \u201cThe \nforeign influence security concerns are mitigated as Applicant is not likely to be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign sex worker.\u201d Id. at 16.  Conversely, she determined under Guideline D, \nJ, and E that Applicant\u2019s conduct made him vulnerable because he has \u201cnot been fully forthcoming \nwith his boss, FSO, family, and friends\u201d and \u201chas disclosed little of his involvement with \nprostitutes to those persons who matter in his personal and professional life.\u201d Id. at 11 and 14. \nHer analysis under the three guidelines clearly distinguishes the differing security concerns and is \nsupported by the record. It is well-established that a Judge may weigh the same evidence \ndifferently under different guidelines. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 16-02483 at 2 (App. Bd. Jun. 11, \n2018). Moreover, a finding of mitigation under one guideline does not compel a similar finding \nunder another. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 13-01281 at 4 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2014). We also note \nthat Guidelines D, J, and E focus more on a lack of judgment in an applicant\u2019s conduct than does \nGuideline B. \nOn appeal, Applicant reiterates that he did not know either that his conduct in State X and \nState Y was illegal or that his conduct overseas was in violation of the U.S. policy that prohibits \nfederal contractors from engaging in commercial sex acts. Regarding the first claim, it has long \nbeen established that \u201cignorance of the law will not excuse any person, either civilly or criminally.\u201d \nBarlow v. United States, 7 Pet. 404, 411 (1833); see also Cheek v. United States, 498 U.S. 192, \n199 (1991)(\u201cThe general rule that ignorance of the law or a mistake of law is no defense to criminal \nprosecution is deeply rooted in the American legal system.\u201d).  \nRegarding the second claim, Applicant argues as follows: he testified at hearing that he did \nnot recall being trained on the CTIP rule that commercial sex acts are prohibited; the Judge \nnevertheless \u201cconcluded that [he] was aware of the zero-tolerance policy and did it anyway\u201d; and \nher determination is \u201can erroneous conclusion not founded in the record.\u201d Appeal Brief at 8. \nReading the Judge\u2019s decision as a whole, we conclude that she did not find that Applicant \nknowingly violated the CTIP policy. Instead, she concluded that Applicant, while maintaining \naccess to highly sensitive classified information, engaged in conduct that he should have \nrecognized by virtue of training and experience as incompatible with the trust and confidence that \nhad been reposed in him by the Government. In this regard, the Judge stated: \n[I]n light of his experience in counterintelligence and his annual training in \ncombating human trafficking, Applicant can be expected to have known that his \nrepeated patronizing of sex workers, both in the United States and abroad, is \ninconsistent with the judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness that must be \ndemanded from individuals holding a top secret clearance with SCI access \neligibility.
